17088400,"Recurrent infections, hypotonia, and mental retardation caused by duplication of MECP2 and adjacent region in Xq28.","OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to describe the neurologic and clinical features of affected males from families with X-linked patterns of severe mental retardation, hypotonia, recurrent respiratory infection, and microduplication of Xq28 that consistently includes the MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene. STUDY DESIGN: To identify duplications, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the MECP2 gene was performed on male probands from families with X-linked mental retardation. The males either had linkage to Xq28 or had a phenotype consistent with previous reports involving Xq28 functional disomy. After detection of a duplication of MECP2, additional family members were tested to confirm the MECP2 duplication segregated with the affected phenotype, and X-inactivation studies were performed on carrier females. RESULTS: Six families with multiple affected males having MECP2 duplications were identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and the carrier mothers were subsequently shown to have highly skewed X inactivation. In 5 of 6 families, the microduplication extended proximally to include the L1 cell adhesion molecule gene. The primary clinical features associated with this microduplication are infantile hypotonia, recurrent respiratory infection, severe mental retardation, absence of speech development, seizures, and spasticity. CONCLUSIONS: Although many of the phenotypic features of our patients are rather nonspecific in cohorts of individuals with syndromic and nonsyndromic mental retardation, the proneness to infection is quite striking because the patients had normal growth and were not physically debilitated. Although the etiology of the infections is not understood, we recommend considering MECP2 dosage studies and a genetics referral in individuals with severe developmental delay and neurologic findings, especially when a history of recurrent respiratory ailments has been documented.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19133692,"15q overgrowth syndrome: a newly recognized phenotype associated with overgrowth, learning difficulties, characteristic facial appearance, renal anomalies and increased dosage of distal chromosome 15q.","Trisomy and tetrasomy of distal chromosome 15q have rarely been reported. Although most of the described patients have some learning difficulties and are overgrown, the phenotype associated with distal trisomy/tetrasomy 15q is uncertain due to the small numbers of reported cases and the common co-occurrence of additional chromosome deletions in many patients with trisomy 15q. We present five individuals with overgrowth, learning difficulties and increased dosage of distal 15q. Partial trisomy 15q was identified in four of these cases. Two were generated through recombination of a parental pericentric inversion and two were generated through malsegregation of a maternal balanced 14;15 reciprocal translocation. In all four cases the trisomy can be considered ""pure"" as the 14p and 15p monosomies will exert no phenotypic effect. Partial tetrasomy 15q, as the result of an analphoid supernumerary chromosome derived from an inverted duplication of distal 15q, was identified in the fifth patient. In addition to the overgrowth and learning difficulties, all five had a characteristic facial appearance and three had renal anomalies. The gestalt consists of a long, thin face with a prominent chin and nose. Renal anomalies included renal agenesis, horseshoe kidney, and hydronephrosis. We provide further support for a distinct ""15q overgrowth syndrome"" caused by either trisomy or tetrasomy resulting in increased dosage of distal 15q. In addition we propose that renal anomalies and a distinctive facial appearance be considered major features of this condition.",journal article
10951463,Tetrasomy 15q25-->qter: cytogenetic and molecular characterization of an analphoid supernumerary marker chromosome.,"Tetrasomy for the distal long arm of chromosome 15 is a rare finding. It has been previously described in seven patients, all of whom had a supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC) derived from distal 15q. These SMC contained no apparent centromeres (C-band/alpha-satellite negative), and belong to a novel class of SMC with neocentromeres. We present the oldest surviving patient with tetrasomy for distal 15q. The proposita was a 10-year-old girl with moderate to severe mental retardation, absent speech, hypotonia, minor facial anomalies, unusual digits, and pigmentation anomalies. Mosaicism for a symmetrical SMC was identified in metaphases from lymphocytes and fibroblasts. Parental karyotypes were normal, indicating a de novo origin for the SMC. FISH with a whole chromosome paint for chromosome 15 showed that the SMC was derived entirely from chromosome 15. However, C-banding and FISH with chromosome 15 probes D15Z1, D15S11, SNRPN, and PML were all negative. FISH with the FES probe at 15q26 showed hybridization to both ends of the SMC. The marker was interpreted as an analphoid inverted duplication of 15q25-->qter containing a presumed neocentromere. Previous molecular studies suggested either a mitotic or paternal meiotic origin for these distal 15q SMC. However, molecular analysis with chromosome 15 polymorphic markers showed that the analphoid SMC(15) in the proposita originated from a maternal meiotic error. The origins and mechanisms involved in formation of these distal 15q SMC appear to be more diverse than for the proximal pseudodicentic SMC(15).",journal article; case reports
12404101,Overgrowth and trisomy 15q26.1-qter including the IGF1 receptor gene: report of two families and review of the literature.,"Overgrowth is rarely associated with chromosomal imbalances. Here we report on four children from two unrelated families presenting with overgrowth and a terminal duplication of the long arm of chromosome 15 diagnosed using cytogenetic and FISH studies. In both cases, chromosome analysis of the parents showed a balanced translocation involving 15q26.1-qter. Molecular and cytogenetic studies showed three copies of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) gene. This finding suggests that overgrowth observed in our patients might be causally related to a dosage effect of the IGF1R gene, in contrast to severe growth retardation observed in patients with terminal deletion of 15q. The present observation emphasises the importance of chromosome analysis in patients with overgrowth and mental retardation. Moreover, it further delineates a specific phenotype related to trisomy 15q26.1-qter with macrosomia at birth, overgrowth, macrocephaly and mild developmental delay being the major clinical features.",journal article
20603595,A girl with 15q overgrowth syndrome and dup(15)(q24q26.3) that included telomeric sequences.,"Distal 15q trisomy or tetrasomy is associated with a characteristic phenotype that includes mild to moderate intellectual disability, abnormal behavior, speech impairment, overgrowth, hyperlaxity, long face, prominent nose, puffy cheeks, pointed chin, small ears, and hand anomalies (mainly arachno- and camptodactyly). We present the case of a 13-yr-old girl with the main clinical features of 15q overgrowth syndrome and a 46,XX,dup(15)(q24q26.3)[117]/46,XX[3].ish dup(15)(q24q26.3) (SNPRN+,PML+,subtel++,tel++) de novo karyotype. The findings in this case are consistent with those in the previous distal 15q trisomy cases that presented with overgrowth and mental retardation. Further, the rearranged chromosome had a double set of directly oriented telomeric and subtelomeric sequences.",journal article; case reports
7613891,Abdominal aortic aneurysm in the Irish population: a familial screening study.,"A pilot screening programme was undertaken in Ireland to determine the incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (diameter 3 cm or greater) in the siblings of 120 patients known to have AAA. There were 621 siblings; 270 of them were dead, 32 were over 80 years old and 85 lived outside Ireland, leaving 234 under 80 years of age still living in Ireland who were invited to attend for ultrasonographic screening. Of the 270 siblings who had died, 102 were women and 168 men; eight men (4.8 per cent) had died from ruptured AAA. Only 125 (53.4 percent) of the 234 siblings agreed to participate in the screening programme, 60 brothers from 31 families and 65 sisters from 35 families. Fifteen (12.0 per cent) of the 125 siblings had an AAA (median size 4.2 (range 3.1-6.8) cm), 13 (22 per cent) of the 60 male siblings and two (3 per cent) of the 65 female siblings. The prevalence of AAA among siblings was not affected by the age or sex of the patient with aneurysm. Seven of the 14 male siblings with hypertension had an AAA, compared with only six of the 46 who were normotensive (P = 0.01). The high incidence of AAA in brothers of affected patients highlights the need to counsel this group on their risk of aneurysm. The relatively low participation rate by siblings in this screening programme indicates that a hospital-based unit is unlikely to be effective in recruiting all patient siblings at risk from an AAA.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
9823488,Adams-Oliver syndrome associated with cardiovascular malformations.,"We describe two families with Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS), an autosomal dominant malformation syndrome (MIM No. 10030), in which cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) have been reported previously. In the first family, twin boys and their mother had the typical digital and scalp defects of AOS with various obstructive CVMs of the left heart (bicuspid aortic valve, Shone's complex). At least three other relatives not examined personally are reported to have related CVMs (aortic valve stenosis, hypoplastic left heart syndrome). In the second family, a girl had typical AOS digital and scalp defects and a bicuspid aortic valve. At least three other relatives are reported to be mildly affected. Tetralogy of Fallot had been previously reported as the most common CVM in AOS [Zapata HH, Sletten LJ, Pierport MEM (1995). J Med Genet 47:80-84.]. However, with the addition of these new patients and two other literature reports, we emphasize that approximately 20% have a CVM, frequently obstructive lesions of the left heart. Cardiology consultation should be offered to most patients with AOS.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; review; journal article; case reports"

2275931,Photic sneeze reflex in nephropathic cystinosis.,Photic induced sneeze is a reflex that occurs in certain individuals after exposure to bright light. Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism in which nonprotein cystine accumulates within lysosomes. The pathognomonic ocular manifestation of cystinosis is corneal crystal deposition. We observed photic induced sneezes during ophthalmoscopic examination in five of 19 patients with nephropathic cystinosis (26%). We report on this observation and discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms for photic induced sneezing in cystinosis.,"research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
1484939,A clinical study of type 2 neurofibromatosis.,"The clinical features, age at onset of symptoms and survival of 150 patients with type 2 neurofibromatosis were studied. The mean age at onset was 21.57 years (n = 110) and no patients presented after 55 years of age. Patients presented with symptoms attributable to vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuroma), cranial meningiomas and spinal tumours. In 100 patients studied personally by the authors 44 per cent presented with deafness and this was unilateral in the majority (35/44). Deafness was accompanied by tinnitus in a further 10 per cent and muscle weakness or wasting was the first symptom in 12 per cent. Less common presenting symptoms were seizures (8 per cent), vertigo (8 per cent) numbness and tingling (2 per cent) and blindness (1 per cent). Eleven patients were diagnosed asymptomatically through screening. CafÃ© au lait spots occurred in 43 per cent (n = 43) but only one case had six. Skin tumours were detected in 68 per cent (68/100) and 38 per cent (34/90) had an identifiable lens opacity or cataract. The mean age at death in 40 cases was 36.25 years and all but one death was a result of a complication of neurofibromatosis. There are marked inter-family differences in disease severity and tumour susceptibility.",review; journal article
7747758,Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2): clinical characteristics of 63 affected individuals and clinical evidence for heterogeneity.,"To determine the spectrum of manifestations in neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and to assess possible heterogeneity, we evaluated 63 affected individuals from 32 families. Work-up included skin and neurologic examinations, audiometry, a complete ophthalmology examination with slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the lens and fundus, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and, in some, of the spine. Mean age-at-onset in 58 individuals was 20.3 years; initial symptoms resulted from vestibular schwannomas (44.4%), other CNS tumors (22.2%), skin tumors (12.7%), and ocular manifestations including cataracts and retinal hamartomas (12.7%). Five asymptomatic individuals were diagnosed through screening. Vestibular schwannomas were documented in 62 individuals (98.4%); other findings included cataracts (81.0%), skin tumors (67.7%), spinal tumors (67.4%), and meningiomas (49.2%). Usually, clinical manifestations and course were similar within families but differed among families. To assess possible heterogeneity, we assigned affected individuals to three proposed subtypes (representing mild, intermediate, and severe NF2) based on age-at-onset, presence or absence of CNS tumors other than vestibular schwannomas, and presence or absence of retinal hamartomas. Comparisons among the three subtypes for many clinical parameters demonstrated that patients in the mild subtype differed from those in the other two subtypes for most parameters, but that none of the parameters distinguished patients in the intermediate subtype from those in the severe subtype. Thus, there are likely two rather than three subtypes of NF2. Classification of patients to subtype may aid in counseling about long-term prognosis and in formulating individualized guidelines for medical surveillance.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
19476995,Neurofibromatosis type 2.,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an autosomal-dominant multiple neoplasia syndrome that results from mutations in the NF2 tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome 22q. It has a frequency of one in 25,000 livebirths and nearly 100% penetrance by 60 years of age. Half of patients inherit a germline mutation from an affected parent and the remainder acquire a de novo mutation for neurofibromatosis type 2. Patients develop nervous system tumours (schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, astrocytomas, and neurofibromas), peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmological lesions (cataracts, epiretinal membranes, and retinal hamartomas), and cutaneous lesions (skin tumours). Optimum treatment is multidisciplinary because of the complexities associated with management of the multiple, progressive, and protean lesions associated with the disorder. We review the molecular pathogenesis, genetics, clinical findings, and management strategies for neurofibromatosis type 2.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; review; journal article"
8318482,Lens opacities in neurofibromatosis 2: further significant correlations.,"This prospective study of 96 individuals from 29 families with neurofibromatosis 2, 49 of whom were affected, confirms in an extended series the previously reported association between posterior subcapsular/capsular cataract and neurofibromatosis 2. Posterior subcapsular/capsular cataracts were found in 36 (80%) of the 45 affected individuals (four individuals were excluded from statistical analyses). In addition, the association of peripheral cortical lens opacities with neurofibromatosis 2 was found to be statistically significant. Seventeen of the patients with neurofibromatosis 2 (37.8%) had peripheral cortical cataracts in comparison with none of the unaffected family members (p < 0.0001). In three patients peripheral cortical opacities were present despite the absence of posterior subcapsular/capsular cataracts. These findings support the inclusion of cortical cataracts of early onset, in addition to posterior subcapsular/capsular cataracts, in the diagnostic criteria of neurofibromatosis 2.",research-article; journal article
17847006,Homozygous mutation in SPATA16 is associated with male infertility in human globozoospermia.,"Globozoospermia is a rare (incidence <0.1% in male infertile patients) form of teratozoospermia, mainly characterized by round-headed spermatozoa that lack an acrosome. It originates from a disturbed spermiogenesis, which is expected to be induced by a genetic factor. Several family cases and recessive mouse models with the same phenotype support this expectation. In this study, we present a consanguineous family with three affected brothers, in whom we have identified a homozygous mutation in the spermatogenesis-specific gene SPATA16. This is the first example of a nonsyndromic male infertility condition in humans caused by an autosomal gene defect, and it could also mean that the identification of other partners like SPATA16 could elucidate acrosome formation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; case-report"
17031479,Free amino acid and dipeptide changes in the body fluids from Alzheimer's disease subjects.,"Our aim was to determine changes in free amino acid (FAA) and dipeptide (DP) concentrations in probable Alzheimer's disease (pAD) subjects compared with control (CT) subjects using liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS2). We recruited gender- and age-matched study participants based on neurological and neuropsychological assessments. We measured FAAs and DPs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma and urine using LCMS2 with selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Imidazole-containing FAAs (histidine, methyl-histidine), catecholamines (L-DOPA and dopamine), citrulline, ornithine, glycine and antioxidant DPs (carnosine and anserine) accounted for the major changes between CT and pAD. Carnosine levels were significantly lower in pAD (328.4 +/- 91.31 nmol/dl) than in CT plasma (654.23 +/- 100.61 nmol/dl). In contrast, L-DOPA levels were higher in pAD (1400.84 +/- 253.68) than CT (513.10 +/- 121.61 nmol/dl) plasma. These data underscore the importance of FAA and DP metabolism in the pathogenesis of AD. Since our data show changes in antioxidants, neurotransmitters and their precursors, or FAA associated with urea metabolism in pAD compared with CT, we propose that manipulation of these metabolic pathways may be important in preventing AD progression.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
8113408,Hereditary renal amyloidosis with a novel variant fibrinogen.,"Two families with hereditary renal amyloidosis were found to have a novel mutation in the fibrinogen A alpha chain gene. This form of amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by proteinuria, hypertension, and subsequent azotemia. DNAs of patients with amyloidosis were screened for a polymorphism in fibrinogen A alpha chain gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and affected individuals from two kindreds were found to have a mutation. Both of these kindreds are American of Irish descent presenting with non-neuropathic, nephropathic amyloidosis in the fifth to the seventh decade of life. DNA sequencing showed a point mutation in the fibrinogen A alpha chain gene that is responsible for substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 526. By restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, 7 affected individuals and 14 asymptomatic individuals in these two kindreds were positive for the fibrinogen A alpha chain Val 526 gene. Fibrinogen was isolated from plasma of a heterozygous gene carrier and shown to contain approximately 50% variant fibrinogen. Discovery of this new mutation confirms the association between fibrinogen A alpha chain variant and hereditary renal amyloidosis and establishes a new biochemical subtype of amyloidosis.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; case reports"
22693999,Hereditary systemic amyloidosis due to Asp76Asn variant β2-microglobulin.,"We describe a kindred with slowly progressive gastrointestinal symptoms and autonomic neuropathy caused by autosomal dominant, hereditary systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid consists of Asp76Asn variant β(2)-microglobulin. Unlike patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis caused by sustained high plasma concentrations of wild-type β(2)-microglobulin, the affected members of this kindred had normal renal function and normal circulating β(2)-microglobulin values. The Asp76Asn β(2)-microglobulin variant was thermodynamically unstable and remarkably fibrillogenic in vitro under physiological conditions. Previous studies of β(2)-microglobulin aggregation have not shown such amyloidogenicity for single-residue substitutions. Comprehensive biophysical characterization of the β(2)-microglobulin variant, including its 1.40-Å, three-dimensional structure, should allow further elucidation of fibrillogenesis and protein misfolding.",research-article; journal article
8446170,Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder of motor neurons in the cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Its cause is unknown and it is uniformly fatal, typically within five years. About 10% of cases are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with high penetrance after the sixth decade. In most instances, sporadic and autosomal dominant familial ALS (FALS) are clinically similar. We have previously shown that in some but not all FALS pedigrees the disease is linked to a genetic defect on chromosome 21q (refs 8, 9). Here we report tight genetic linkage between FALS and a gene that encodes a cytosolic, Cu/Zn-binding superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a homodimeric metalloenzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the toxic superoxide anion O2.- to O2 and H2O2 (ref. 10). Given this linkage and the potential role of free radical toxicity in other neurodenegerative disorders, we investigated SOD1 as a candidate gene in FALS. We identified 11 different SOD1 missense mutations in 13 different FALS families.",review-article; review; journal article
10590074,Mutations in ribosomal protein S19 gene and diamond blackfan anemia: wide variations in phenotypic expression.,"Mutations of the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) gene were recently identified in 10 patients with Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA). To determine the prevalence of mutations in this gene in DBA and to begin to define the molecular basis for the observed variable clinical phenotype of this disorder, the genomic sequence of the 6 exons and the 5' untranslated region of the RPS19 gene was directly assessed in DBA index cases from 172 new families. Mutations affecting the coding sequence of RPS19 or splice sites were found in 34 cases (19.7%), whereas mutations in noncoding regions were found in 8 patients (4.6%). Mutations included nonsense, missense, splice sites, and frameshift mutations. A hot spot for missense mutations was identified between codons 52 and 62 of the RPS19 gene in a new sequence consensus motif W-[YFW]-[YF]-x-R-[AT]-A-[SA]-x-[AL]-R-[HRK]-[ILV]-Y. No correlation between the nature of mutations and the different patterns of clinical expression, including age at presentation, presence of malformations, and therapeutic outcome, could be documented. Moreover, RPS19 mutations were also found in some first-degree relatives presenting only with isolated high erythrocyte adenosine deaminase activity and/or macrocytosis. The lack of a consistent relationship between the nature of the mutations and the clinical phenotype implies that yet unidentified factors modulate the phenotypic expression of the primary genetic defect in families with RPS19 mutations.",review-article; review; journal article
10753603,Ribosomal protein S19 gene mutations in patients with diamond-blackfan anemia and identification of ribosomal protein S19 pseudogenes.,"Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital pure red cell hypoplasia characterized by a selective defect of erythropoiesis with a normochromic macrocytic anemia and reticulocytopenia often accompanied by various congenital anomalies. The critical region responsible for the pathogenesis of DBA has been mapped in some patients to chromosome 19q13.2 (P Gustavsson, E Garelli, N Draptchinskaia, et al. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 63:1388-1395, 1998) and the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is believed to be the candidate gene. Here we present molecular analysis of the RPS19 gene in DBA patients from the Czech National DBA Registry. We found that the RPS19 gene was mutated in 25% (5/20) of DBA patients (insertion, deletion, and point mutations, but no nonsense or splice site mutations). Point mutations were localized to hot spots defined by Willig (TN Willig, N Draptchinskaia, I Dianzani, et al. Blood 94:4294-4306, 1999). Moreover, we describe two processed RPS19 pseudogenes, which were not expressed. Possible models of the DBA pathogenesis in the view of RPS19 mutations are discussed.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
7267232,Platelet number and function in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.,"Congenital red cell aplasia (Diamond-Blackfan anemia) is occasionally associated with hematologic defects other than a deficiency of red blood cell progenitors, but such alterations have not been well studied. The frequency and magnitude of abnormalities in platelet count and platelet function were therefore examined in 38 patients. Thrombocytosis was seen in 21 patients, and 12 had mild thrombocytopenia on at least one occasion. Elevated platelet counts were demonstrated repeatedly in nine children. The three patients with the lowest platelet counts also had leukopenia. Platelet aggregation was normal in all 16 patients in whom it was studied, and bleeding times were within the normal range in 14 of them. Bleeding signs and symptoms were not observed. It is concluded that thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia often occurs but that platelet function is normal in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.",comment; editorial
1918400,Diamond-Blackfan syndrome and neutropenia.,"Neutropenia is a rare complication of Diamond-Blackfan syndrome (congenital hypoplastic anaemia). Three patients are reported: all had neutropenia as well as anaemia, and to investigate the cause of the neutropenia culture of bone marrow for granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells (GMCFCs) was performed. Two cases had a low incidence of GMCFCs, but the third case had a high incidence. These findings suggest that myeloid precursors can be abnormal in Diamond-Blackfan syndrome and that the mechanism of neutropenia may, like that of anaemia, vary from patient to patient.",editorial
19034419,Paired box 6 (PAX6) regulates glucose metabolism via proinsulin processing mediated by prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3).,"Human patients with aniridia caused by heterozygous PAX6 mutations display abnormal glucose metabolism, but the underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. Disturbed islet architecture has been proposed as the reason why mice with complete inactivation of paired box 6 (PAX6) in the pancreas develop diabetes. This is not, however, the case in human aniridia patients with heterozygous PAX6 deficiency and no apparent defects in pancreatic development. We investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the development of abnormal glucose metabolism in these patients.A human aniridia pedigree with a PAX6 R240Stop mutation was examined for abnormal glucose metabolism using an OGTT. The underlying mechanism was further investigated using Pax6 R266Stop mutant small-eye mice, which also have abnormal glucose metabolism similar to that in PAX6 R240Stop mutation human aniridia patients.Paired box 6 (PAX6) deficiency, both in aniridia patients with a heterozygous PAX6 R240Stop mutation and in mice with a heterozygous Pax6 R266Stop mutation, causes defective proinsulin processing and abnormal glucose metabolism. PAX6 can bind to the promoter and directly upregulate production of prohormone convertase (PC)1/3, an enzyme essential for conversion of proinsulin to insulin. Pax6 mutations lead to PC1/3 deficiency, resulting in defective proinsulin processing and abnormal glucose metabolism.This study indicates a novel function for PAX6 in the regulation of proinsulin processing and glucose metabolism via modulation of PC1/3 production. It also provides an insight into the abnormal glucose metabolism caused by heterozygous PAX6 mutations in humans and mice.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
9973281,Molecular analysis of SALL1 mutations in Townes-Brocks syndrome.,"Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited malformation syndrome characterized by anal, renal, limb, and ear anomalies. Recently, we showed that mutations in the putative zinc finger transcription factor gene SALL1 cause TBS. To determine the spectrum of SALL1 mutations and to investigate the genotype-phenotype correlations in TBS, we examined 23 additional families with TBS or similar phenotypes for SALL1 mutations. In 9 of these families mutations were identified. None of the mutations has previously been described. Two of these mutations are nonsense mutations, one of which occurred in three unrelated families. Five of the mutations are short deletions. All of the mutations are located 5' of the first double zinc finger (DZF) encoding region and are therefore predicted to result in putative prematurely terminated proteins lacking all DZF domains. This suggests that only SALL1 mutations that remove the DZF domains result in TBS. We also present evidence that in rare cases SALL1 mutations can lead to phenotypes similar to Goldenhar syndrome. However, phenotypic differences in TBS do not seem to depend on the site of mutation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
22308078,Implications for genotype-phenotype predictions in Townes-Brocks syndrome: case report of a novel SALL1 deletion and review of the literature.,"Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is a well-described genetic syndrome characterized by anal, ear, and thumb anomalies and variable expressivity. Over 60 nonsense and frameshift mutations have been identified in SALL1, the zinc finger transcription factor causing TBS, and are proposed to cause disease via a dominant negative mechanism. In contrast, only four deletions have been described, with mild phenotypes reported as a result of haploinsufficiency. We report on a family with features of TBS in whom a novel 149â€‰kb deletion spanning the SALL1 gene was identified by high resolution cytogenetics SNP microarray. We review the available genotype-phenotype information for all known truncating mutations and deletions. Taken together, they do not support the correlation of SALL1 deletions with a milder TBS phenotype and highlight a need for more robust clinical phenotyping combined with investigation of mutational mechanism.",review; journal article; case reports
3180506,A new family with the Townes-Brocks syndrome.,"We describe a new family with the Townes-Brocks syndrome, a dominantly inherited syndrome of anal, urorenal, ear and limb malformations. The proband shows the full spectrum of anomalies, including imperforate anus, prominent perineal raphe, rectoperineal fistula, triphalangeal thumb, preaxial hexadactyly, syndactyly, clinodactyly, preauricular protuberances, hypoplastic satyr ears, sensorineural hearing loss and urorenal anomalies. In contrast, the father shows only limb anomalies, sensorineural hearing loss and renal anomalies. Anorectal malformations, which are present in almost every patient with the Townes-Brocks syndrome, were absent in the father. This case report illustrates the intrafamilial variability of the Townes-Brocks syndrome. Consequently, careful examination of relatives of patients with this syndrome is necessary for the differential diagnosis with the sporadically inherited VA(C)TER(L) association.",correction; journal article
23785305,BMS1 is mutated in aplasia cutis congenita.,"Aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) manifests with localized skin defects at birth of unknown cause, mostly affecting the scalp vertex. Here, genome-wide linkage analysis and exome sequencing was used to identify the causative mutation in autosomal dominant ACC. A heterozygous Arg-to-His missense mutation (p.R930H) in the ribosomal GTPase BMS1 is identified in ACC that is associated with a delay in 18S rRNA maturation, consistent with a role of BMS1 in processing of pre-rRNAs of the small ribosomal subunit. Mutations that affect ribosomal function can result in a cell cycle defect and ACC skin fibroblasts with the BMS1 p.R930H mutation show a reduced cell proliferation rate due to a p21-mediated G1/S phase transition delay. Unbiased comparative global transcript and proteomic analyses of ACC fibroblasts with this mutation confirm a central role of increased p21 levels for the ACC phenotype, which are associated with downregulation of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) and serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SRSFs). Functional enrichment analysis of the proteomic data confirmed a defect in RNA post-transcriptional modification as the top-ranked cellular process altered in ACC fibroblasts. The data provide a novel link between BMS1, the cell cycle, and skin morphogenesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
29298116,Somatic Activating KRAS Mutations in Arteriovenous Malformations of the Brain.,"BACKGROUND:Sporadic arteriovenous malformations of the brain, which are morphologically abnormal connections between arteries and veins in the brain vasculature, are a leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke in young adults and children. The genetic cause of this rare focal disorder is unknown. METHODS:We analyzed tissue and blood samples from patients with arteriovenous malformations of the brain to detect somatic mutations. We performed exome DNA sequencing of tissue samples of arteriovenous malformations of the brain from 26 patients in the main study group and of paired blood samples from 17 of those patients. To confirm our findings, we performed droplet digital polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) analysis of tissue samples from 39 patients in the main study group (21 with matching blood samples) and from 33 patients in an independent validation group. We interrogated the downstream signaling pathways, changes in gene expression, and cellular phenotype that were induced by activating KRAS mutations, which we had discovered in tissue samples. RESULTS:We detected somatic activating KRAS mutations in tissue samples from 45 of the 72 patients and in none of the 21 paired blood samples. In endothelial cell-enriched cultures derived from arteriovenous malformations of the brain, we detected KRAS mutations and observed that expression of mutant KRAS (KRASG12V) in endothelial cells in vitro induced increased ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activity, increased expression of genes related to angiogenesis and Notch signaling, and enhanced migratory behavior. These processes were reversed by inhibition of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-ERK signaling. CONCLUSIONS:We identified activating KRAS mutations in the majority of tissue samples of arteriovenous malformations of the brain that we analyzed. We propose that these malformations develop as a result of KRAS-induced activation of the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway in brain endothelial cells.

16152640,Stickler syndrome: clinical characteristics and diagnostic criteria.,"The purpose of this study was to establish diagnostic criteria for Stickler syndrome. Ninety patients from 38 families had complete evaluations for possible Stickler syndrome. Molecular confirmation of COL2A1 mutation status (type I Stickler syndrome) was available on 25 patients from six families. In the remaining 65 patients, 47 from 25 families were affected with Stickler syndrome and 18 from seven families were unaffected with Stickler syndrome. A diagnostic nosology based on type I Stickler patients with known COL2A1 mutations was applied to clinically affected and unaffected patients. A diagnostic scale of 9 points evaluated molecular data or family history data and characteristic ocular, orofacial, auditory, and musculoskeletal findings. A score of > or =5 was diagnostic of Stickler syndrome. These criteria demonstrate 100% sensitivity when applied to type I Stickler syndrome patients with known COL2A1 mutations, 98% sensitivity when applied to clinically affected Stickler patients, and 86% specificity when applied to patients unaffected based on clinical and/or molecular analysis. We conclude that diagnostic criteria based on type I Stickler patients with molecularly confirmed COL2A1 mutations appear to be sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of this syndrome and should be helpful to clinicians when making the diagnosis.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
11007540,Variation in the vitreous phenotype of Stickler syndrome can be caused by different amino acid substitutions in the X position of the type II collagen Gly-X-Y triple helix.,"Stickler syndrome is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by arthropathy, midline clefting, hearing loss, midfacial hypoplasia, myopia, and retinal detachment. These features are highly variable both between and within families. Mutations causing the disorder have been found in the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes. Premature termination codons in COL2A1 that result in haploinsufficiency of type II collagen are a common finding. These produce a characteristic congenital ""membranous"" anomaly of the vitreous of all affected individuals. Experience has shown that vitreous slit-lamp biomicroscopy can distinguish between patients with COL2A1 mutations and those with dominant negative mutations in COL11A1, who produce a different ""beaded"" vitreous phenotype. Here we characterize novel dominant negative mutations in COL2A1 that result in Stickler syndrome. Both alter amino acids in the X position of the Gly-X-Y triple-helical region. A recurrent R365C mutation occurred in two unrelated sporadic cases and resulted in the membranous vitreous anomaly associated with haploinsufficiency. In a large family with linkage to COL2A1, with a LOD score of 2.8, a unique L467F mutation produced a novel ""afibrillar"" vitreous gel devoid of all normal lamella structure. These data extend the mutation spectrum of the COL2A1 gene and help explain the basis for the different vitreous phenotypes seen in Stickler syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
9610535,"Reduced penetrance, variable expressivity, and genetic heterogeneity of familial atrial septal defects.","BACKGROUND: Secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common congenital heart malformation that occurs as an isolated anomaly in 10% of individuals with congenital heart disease. Although some embryological pathways have been elucidated, the molecular etiologies of ASD are not fully understood. Most cases of ASD are isolated, but some individuals with ASD have a family history of this defect or other congenital heart malformations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical evaluation of three families identified individuals with ASD in multiple generations. ASD was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait in each family. ASD was the most common anomaly, but other heart defects occurred alone or in association with ASD in individuals from each kindred. Genome-wide linkage studies in one kindred localized a familial ASD disease gene to chromosome 5p (multipoint LOD score=3.6, theta=0.0). Assessment of 20 family members with the disease haplotype revealed that 9 had ASD, 8 were clinically unaffected, and 3 had other cardiac defects (aortic stenosis, atrial septal aneurysm, and persistent left superior vena cava). Familial ASD did not map to chromosome 5p in two other families. CONCLUSIONS: Familial ASD is a genetically heterogeneous disorder; one disease gene maps to chromosome 5p. Recognition of the heritable basis of familial ASD is complicated by low disease penetrance and variable expressivity. Identification of ASD or other congenital heart defects in more than one family member should prompt clinical evaluation of all relatives.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19659750,Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: frequency analysis and clinical characterization of 45 families from Portugal.,"The relative frequency of the different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) varies widely amongst different geographic locations. Here we describe a series of 45 ADCA families from Portugal.Patients with progressive cerebellar dysfunction of autosomal dominant transmission underwent a clinical examination protocol and genetic testing for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1 to Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). We registered the clinical characteristics and frequency of each type of ataxia.MJD/SCA3 was the most frequent ADCA (26 families, 57.8% of all families), followed by DRPLA (5 families, 11.2%), SCA7 (2 families, 4.4%), SCA2 and SCA1 (1 family each, 2.2% each); 10 families (22.2%) had no molecular diagnosis. SCA1 and SCA7 patients had African ancestry. DRPLA patients had Portuguese ancestry and were characterized by prominent anticipation and a variable combination of epilepsy, extra-pyramidal symptoms and dementia. Ophtalmoparesis, slow saccades and retinopathy were most distinctive of SCA3, SCA2 and SCA7 cases, respectively.MJD/SCA3 was the most common ADCA in this group of families. The high frequency of DRPLA and presence of SCA1 and SCA7 cases was unexpected. The presence of these rarer ADCA types probably reflects migration phenomena, posing a challenge for differential diagnosis.",journal article
10525976,"Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I: oculomotor abnormalities in families with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3.","Forty-six patients suffering from autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I (ADCA I) underwent to a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis by molecular genetic assignment to the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2, or 3 (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3) genetic locus and electro-oculography. Oculomotor deficits that are attributed to dysfunction of cerebellar structures occurred in all three mutations without major differences between the groups. Gaze-evoked nystagmus, however, was not found to be associated with SCA2. Square wave jerks were exclusively observed in SCA3. The gain in vestibulo-ocular reflex was significantly impaired in SCA3 and SCA1. In SCA3 the severity of vestibular impairment increased with CAG repeat length. Severe saccade slowing was a highly characteristic feature of SCA2. In SCA3 saccade velocity was normal to mildly reduced while SCA1 fell into an intermediate range. The present data show that each mutation is associated with a distinct syndrome of oculomotor deficits. Reduced saccade velocity and the absence of both square-wave jerks and gaze-evoked nystagmus allow one SCA2 to be distinguished from SCA3 patients in almost all cases. The eye movement disorder of SCA1 patients, however, overlaps with both SCA2 and SCA3.",clinical trial; journal article
18685131,"Spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6: disease severity and nonataxia symptoms.","OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that determine disease severity and clinical phenotype of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we studied 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3. or SCA6. METHODS: To measure the severity of ataxia we used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). In addition, nonataxia symptoms were assessed with the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Symptoms (INAS). The INAS count denotes the number of nonataxia symptoms in each patient. RESULTS: An analysis of covariance with SARA score as dependent variable and repeat lengths of the expanded and normal allele, age at onset, and disease duration as independent variables led to multivariate models that explained 60.4% of the SARA score variance in SCA1, 45.4% in SCA2, 46.8% in SCA3, and 33.7% in SCA6. In SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, SARA was mainly determined by repeat length of the expanded allele, age at onset, and disease duration. The only factors determining the SARA score in SCA6 were age at onset and disease duration. The INAS count was 5.0 +/- 2.3 in SCA1, 4.6 +/- 2.2 in SCA2, 5.2 +/- 2.5 in SCA3, and 2.0 +/- 1.7 in SCA6. In SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, SARA score and disease duration were the strongest predictors of the INAS count. In SCA6, only age at onset and disease duration had an effect on the INAS count. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1, SCA2, and SCA3 share a number of common biologic properties, whereas SCA6 is distinct in that its phenotype is more determined by age than by disease-related factors.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
9096761,Clinical manifestations in 105 persons with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.,"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCC; Gorlin syndrome), an autosomal dominant disorder linked to 9q22.3-q31, and caused by mutations in PTC, the human homologue of the Drosophila patched gene, comprises multiple basal cell carcinomas, keratocysts of the jaw, palmar/plantar pits, spine and rib anomalies and calcification of the falx cerebri. We reviewed the findings on 105 affected individuals examined at the NIH since 1985. The data included 48 males and 57 females ranging in age from 4 months to 87 years. Eighty percent of whites (71/90) and 38% (5/13) of African-Americans had at least one basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with the first tumor occurring at a mean age of 23 (median 20) years and 21 (median 20) years, respectively. Excluding individuals exposed to radiation therapy, the number of BCCs ranged from 1 to > 1,000 (median 8) and 1 to 3 (median 2), respectively, in the 2 groups. Jaw cysts occurred in 78/105 (74%) with the first tumor occurring in 80% by the age of 20 years. The number of total jaw cysts ranged from 1 to 28 (median 3). Palmar pits and plantar pits were seen in 87%. Ovarian fibromas were diagnosed by ultrasound in 9/52 (17%) at a mean age of 30 years. Medulloblastoma occurred in 4 patients at a mean age of 2.3 years. Three patients had cleft lip or palate. Physical findings include ""coarse face"" in 54%, relative macrocephaly in 50%, hypertelorism in 42%, frontal bossing in 27%, pectus deformity in 13%, and Sprengel deformity in 11%. Important radiological signs included calcification of the falx cerebri in 65%, of the tentorium cerebelli in 20%, bridged sella in 68%, bifid ribs in 26%, hemivertebrae in 15%, fusion of the vertebral bodies in 10%, and flame shaped lucencies of the phalanges, metacarpal, and carpal bones of the hands in 30%. Several traits previously considered components of the syndrome (including short fourth metacarpal, scoliosis, cervical ribs and spina bifida occulta) were not found to be significantly increased in the affected individuals.

12955762,Identification of an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance in paediatric Behçet's families by segregation analysis.,"We have conducted a segregation analysis in order to characterise the transmission of Behçet Disease (BD), a multifactorial condition with a strong genetic component. Complete information about BD status and pedigree was obtained on 104 probands from our database. We used the criteria of the International Study Group for BD (ISBD) to delineate the clinical status of the sibs: possible BD (patients meeting two criteria), or ascertained BD (patients meeting at least three criteria). A proband was defined as ""paediatric"" when he/she completed ISBD criteria before/by the age of 16 years. Families were distinguished as paediatric (n = 67) (ascertained through a paediatric proband), and non-paediatric (n = 37) ones. An Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm was used to estimate the Mendelian segregation ratio P in nuclear families (two parents and their offspring). The maximum likelihood estimate: Pcirc; = 0.248, calculated in the paediatric data set, was consistent with the theoretical value of P = (1/4) for autosomal recessive inheritance, whereas the Pcirc; value was 0.08 when using the non-paediatric data set. Our work provides the first evidence of genetic heterogeneity in BD, and of the existence of a Mendelian entity in the paediatric BD subgroup. Previous studies failed to show any simple mode of inheritance in BD, probably because they were performed on the whole BD population.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29099052,Urinary Metabolomic Profiling to Identify Potential Biomarkers for the Diagnosis of Behcet's Disease by Gas Chromatography/Time-of-Flight-Mass Spectrometry.,"Diagnosing Behcet's disease (BD) is challenging because of the lack of a diagnostic biomarker. The purposes of this study were to investigate distinctive metabolic changes in urine samples of BD patients and to identify urinary metabolic biomarkers for diagnosis of BD using gas chromatography/time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS). Metabolomic profiling of urine samples from 44 BD patients and 41 healthy controls (HC) were assessed using GC/TOF-MS, in conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis. A total of 110 urinary metabolites were identified. The urine metabolite profiles obtained from GC/TOF-MS analysis could distinguish BD patients from the HC group in the discovery set. The parameter values of the orthogonal partial least squared-discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) model were R²X of 0.231, R²Y of 0.804, and Q² of 0.598. A biomarker panel composed of guanine, pyrrole-2-carboxylate, 3-hydroxypyridine, mannose, l-citrulline, galactonate, isothreonate, sedoheptuloses, hypoxanthine, and gluconic acid lactone were selected and adequately validated as putative biomarkers of BD (sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 93.3%, area under the curve 0.974). OPLS-DA showed clear discrimination of BD and HC groups by a biomarker panel of ten metabolites in the independent set (accuracy 88%). We demonstrated characteristic urinary metabolic profiles and potential urinary metabolite biomarkers that have clinical value in the diagnosis of BD using GC/TOF-MS.",research-article; journal article
21325395,Mutation spectrum of fork-head transcriptional factor gene (FOXL2) in Indian Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) patients.,"AIM: The fork-head transcription factor gene (FOXL2) gene has been implicated in Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) type I and type II. The authors aimed to evaluate the involvement of FOXL2 in familial and sporadic cases of BPES in an Indian cohort. METHODS: The present cohort comprised clinically well-characterised BPES cases that included six affected families, two sporadic cases and 60 unaffected normal controls. The 5' untranslated and coding region of FOXL2 was screened by resequencing and confirmed by restriction digestion. Further, genotype-phenotype correlations were done to understand the implications of the observed mutation. RESULTS: Six mutations were observed in eight cases (87.5%). These included a novel deletion (c.860delC), three previously reported duplications (c.663-692dup 30, c.672-701dup30 and c.843-859dup17), a frame shift (c.804dupC) and a homozygous missense mutation (p.E69K). The p.E69k mutation was seen in both heterozygous and homozygous form in a large four-generational family, and disease severity was found to be directly linked to the allelic dosage. Two SNPs (c.501C→T, c.536C→G) were also noted. An unusual coexistence of polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) with BPES was also seen in one of the families. DISCUSSION: Mutations in the region downstream of the fork-head domain were predominantly responsible for BPES among Indian patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
9657769,Rhnull disease: the amorph type results from a novel double mutation in RhCe gene on D-negative background.,"Rhnull disease, which includes the amorph and regulator types, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by stomatocytosis and chronic hemolytic anemia. We studied here a German family transmitting a putative amorph Rhnull disease gene and identified a rare mutation causing the loss-of-function phenotype. We analyzed the genomic and transcript structure of RH30, RH50, and CD47, the three loci thought to be most critical for expression of the Rh complex in the red blood cell membrane. We showed that in this family the Rh50 and CD47 transcripts were normal in primary sequence. However, the RH30 locus contained an unusual double mutation in exon 7 of the RhCe gene, in addition to a deletion of the RhD gene. The mutation targeted two adjacent codons in multiple arrangements probably via the mechanism of microgene conversion. One scheme entails a noncontiguous deletion of two nucleotides, [ATT(Ile322)-->AT] and [CAC(His323)-->CC], whereas the other involves a T-->C transition [ATT(Ile322)--> ATC] and a dinucleotide deletion [CAC(His323)-->C]. They caused the same shift in open reading frame predicted to encode a shortened protein with 398 amino acids. The loss of two transmembrane domains and gain of a new C-terminal sequence are likely to alter the protein conformation and impair the Rh complex assembly. Our findings establish the molecular identity of an amorph Rhnull disease gene, showing that Rh30 and Rh50 are both essential for the functioning of the Rh structures as a multisubunit complex in the plasma membrane.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
19327734,Duplications involving a conserved regulatory element downstream of BMP2 are associated with brachydactyly type A2.,"Autosomal-dominant brachydactyly type A2 (BDA2), a limb malformation characterized by hypoplastic middle phalanges of the second and fifth fingers, has been shown to be due to mutations in the Bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1B (BMPR1B) or in its ligand Growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5). A linkage analysis performed in a mutation-negative family identified a novel locus for BDA2 on chromosome 20p12.3 that incorporates the gene for Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2). No point mutation was identified in BMP2, so a high-density array CGH analysis covering the critical interval of approximately 1.3 Mb was performed. A microduplication of approximately 5.5 kb in a noncoding sequence approximately 110 kb downstream of BMP2 was detected. Screening of other patients by qPCR revealed a similar duplication in a second family. The duplicated region contains evolutionary highly conserved sequences suggestive of a long-range regulator. By using a transgenic mouse model we can show that this sequence is able to drive expression of a X-Gal reporter construct in the limbs. The almost complete overlap with endogenous Bmp2 expression indicates that a limb-specific enhancer of Bmp2 is located within the identified duplication. Our results reveal an additional functional mechanism for the pathogenesis of BDA2, which is duplication of a regulatory element that affects the expression of BMP2 in the developing limb.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
10986040,Distinct mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase gene ROR2 cause brachydactyly type B.,"Brachydactyly type B (BDB) is an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder characterized by hypoplasia/aplasia of distal phalanges and nails. Recently, heterozygous mutations of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase (TK) ROR2, located within a distinct segment directly after the TK domain, have been shown to be responsible for BDB. We report four novel mutations in ROR2 (two frameshifts, one splice mutation, and one nonsense mutation) in five families with BDB. The mutations predict truncation of the protein within two distinct regions immediately before and after the TK domain, resulting in a complete or partial loss of the intracellular portion of the protein. Patients affected with the distal mutations have a more severe phenotype than do those with the proximal mutation. Our analysis includes the first description of homozygous BDB in an individual with a 5-bp deletion proximal to the TK domain. His phenotype resembles an extreme form of brachydactyly, with extensive hypoplasia of the phalanges and metacarpals/metatarsals and absence of nails. In addition, he has vertebral anomalies, brachymelia of the arms, and a ventricular septal defect-features that are reminiscent of Robinow syndrome, which has also been shown to be caused by mutations in ROR2. The BDB phenotype, as well as the location and the nature of the BDB mutations, suggests a specific mutational effect that cannot be explained by simple haploinsufficiency and that is distinct from that in Robinow syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

We describe two unrelated families with BDB. One family is English; the other family is Canadian but of English ancestry. We assigned the BDB locus in the Canadian family to an 18-cM interval on 9q, using linkage analysis (LOD score 3.5 at recombination fraction [theta] 0, for marker D9S938). Markers across this interval also cosegregated with the BDB phenotype in the English family (LOD score 2.1 at straight theta=0, for marker D9S277). Within this defined interval is a smaller (7.5-cM) region that contains 10 contiguous markers whose disease-associated haplotype is shared by the two families. This latter result suggests a common founder among families of English descent that are affected with BDB.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
19461659,A novel single-base deletion in ROR2 causes atypical brachydactyly type B1 with cutaneous syndactyly in a large Chinese family.,"Mutations in ROR2, encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2, cause two distinct skeletal diseases: autosomal dominant brachydactyly type B1 (BDB1) and autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome. In a large Chinese family with a limb phenotype, consisting of atypical BDB1 and cutaneous syndactyly of varying degrees, we performed a two-point linkage analysis using microsatellite markers on 2q33-q37 and 9q22.31, and found a significant linkage to the ROR2 locus. We identified a novel single-base deletion in ROR2, c.2243delC (p.W749fsX24), and confirmed its segregation with the limb phenotype in the family. This deletion is predicted to produce a truncated ROR2 protein with an additional C-terminal polypeptide of 24 amino-acid residues. To the best of our knowledge, the deletion represents the second ROR2 mutation associated with a BDB1-syndactyly phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18423521,TFAP2A mutations result in branchio-oculo-facial syndrome.,"Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS) is a rare autosomal-dominant cleft palate-craniofacial disorder with variable expressivity. The major features include cutaneous anomalies (cervical, infra- and/or supra-auricular defects, often with dermal thymus), ocular anomalies, characteristic facial appearance (malformed pinnae, oral clefts), and, less commonly, renal and ectodermal (dental and hair) anomalies. The molecular basis for this disorder is heretofore unknown. We detected a 3.2 Mb deletion by 500K SNP microarray in an affected mother and son with BOFS at chromosome 6p24.3. Candidate genes in this region were selected for sequencing on the basis of their expression patterns and involvement in developmental pathways associated with the clinical findings of BOFS. Four additional BOFS patients were found to have de novo missense mutations in the highly conserved exons 4 and 5 (basic region of the DNA binding domain) of the TFAP2A gene in the candidate deleted region. We conclude BOFS is caused by mutations involving TFAP2A.

8825931,Familial café au lait spots: a variant of neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Café au lait spots (CALS) are a frequent and one of the early manifestations of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). However, there are patients with isolated CALS who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for NFI. There are several reports of families in which CALS are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, without any other features of NFI. In one reported family with dominantly inherited CALS linkage to the NF1 locus was ruled out. In order to elucidate the relationship between familial CALS and NF1 further, we performed a linkage analysis in a large kindred with 11 subjects with CALS in three generations and established close linkage between CALS and five NF1 intragenic polymorphisms. We propose that in this family the trait of CALS is allelic to NF1, it is fully penetrant, and it does not confer a risk of other NF1 symptoms.",research-article; journal article

19206169,"Germline BRAF mutations in Noonan, LEOPARD, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes: molecular diversity and associated phenotypic spectrum.","Noonan, LEOPARD, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes (NS, LS, and CFCS) are developmental disorders with overlapping features including distinctive facial dysmorphia, reduced growth, cardiac defects, skeletal and ectodermal anomalies, and variable cognitive deficits. Dysregulated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal traffic has been established to represent the molecular pathogenic cause underlying these conditions. To investigate the phenotypic spectrum and molecular diversity of germline mutations affecting BRAF, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase functioning as a RAS effector frequently mutated in CFCS, subjects with a diagnosis of NS (N=270), LS (N=6), and CFCS (N=33), and no mutation in PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, RAF1, MEK1, or MEK2, were screened for the entire coding sequence of the gene. Besides the expected high prevalence of mutations observed among CFCS patients (52%), a de novo heterozygous missense change was identified in one subject with LS (17%) and five individuals with NS (1.9%). Mutations mapped to multiple protein domains and largely did not overlap with cancer-associated defects. NS-causing mutations had not been documented in CFCS, suggesting that the phenotypes arising from germline BRAF defects might be allele specific. Selected mutant BRAF proteins promoted variable gain of function of the kinase, but appeared less activating compared to the recurrent cancer-associated p.Val600Glu mutant. Our findings provide evidence for a wide phenotypic diversity associated with mutations affecting BRAF, and occurrence of a clinical continuum associated with these molecular lesions.",review-article; review; journal article

We demonstrate that heterogeneous de novo missense mutations in three genes within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway cause CFC syndrome. The majority of cases (18 out of 23) are caused by mutations in BRAF, a gene frequently mutated in cancer. Of the 11 mutations identified, two result in amino acid substitutions that occur in tumors, but most are unique and suggest previously unknown mechanisms of B-Raf activation. Furthermore, three of five individuals without BRAF mutations had missense mutations in either MEK1 or MEK2, downstream effectors of B-Raf. Our findings highlight the involvement of the MAPK pathway in human development and will provide a molecular diagnosis of CFC syndrome.","meta-analysis; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

There are strong genotype-phenotype correlations. BRAF is the major gene for cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), and usually patients with a BRAF mutation have significant cognitive impairment. We report on a patient with LEOPARD syndrome and normal intelligence who was found to carry a novel sequence change in BRAF. The mutation p.L245F was demonstrated to be de novo with no evidence of somatic mosaicism. This observation illustrates that the phenotypic spectrum caused by BRAF mutations is broader than previously assumed and that mental retardation is not necessarily associated. We speculate that the impact of p.L245F on BRAF protein function differs either qualitatively or quantitatively from those mutations associated with CFCS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

Linkage analysis to selected sarcomeric contractile protein genes identified cardiac troponin I (TNNI3) as the likely disease gene. Subsequent mutation analysis revealed a novel missense mutation, which cosegregated with the disease in the family (lod score: 4.8). To determine if idiopathic RCM is part of the clinical expression of TNNI3 mutations, genetic investigations of the gene were performed in an additional nine unrelated RCM patients with restrictive filling patterns, bi-atrial dilatation, normal systolic function, and normal wall thickness. TNNI3 mutations were identified in six of these nine RCM patients. Two of the mutations identified in young individuals were de novo mutations. All mutations appeared in conserved and functionally important domains of the gene. This article was published online in advance of the print edition.

7607651,Assignment of congenital cataract Volkmann type (CCV) to chromosome 1p36.,"Congenital cataract, type Volkmann (McKusick no 115665, gene symbol CCV) is an autosomal dominant eye disease. The disease is characterized by a progressive, central and zonular cataract, with opacities both in the embryonic, fetal and juvenile nucleus and around the anterior and posterior Y-suture. We examined blood samples from 91 members of a Danish pedigree comprising 426 members, by using highly informative short tandem repeat polymorphisms and found the closest linkage of the disease gene (CCV) to a (CA)n dinucleotide repeat polymorphism at locus D1S243 (Zmax = 14.04 at theta M = 0.025 theta F = 0.000), at a penetrance of 0.90. Using two additional chromosome 1 markers, we were able to map the CCV gene in the sequence 1pter-(CCV, D1S243)-D1S468-D1S214. The (enolase 1) gene has been mapped to this area; however, a mutation described in this gene did not give eye disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19005574,The EPHA2 gene is associated with cataracts linked to chromosome 1p.,"Cataracts are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder affecting the ocular lens, and the leading cause of treatable vision loss and blindness worldwide. Here we identify a novel gene linked with a rare autosomal dominant form of childhood cataracts segregating in a four generation pedigree, and further show that this gene is likely associated with much more common forms of age-related cataracts in a case-control cohort.Genomic DNA was prepared from blood leukocytes, and genotyping was performed by means of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, and short tandem repeat (STR) markers. Linkage analyses were performed with the GeneHunter and MLINK programs, and association analyses were performed with the Haploview and Exemplar programs. Mutation detection was achieved by PCR amplification of exons and di-deoxy cycle-sequencing.Genome-wide linkage analysis with SNP markers, identified a likely disease-haplotype interval on chromosome 1p (rs707455-[approximately 10 Mb]-rs477558). Linkage to chromosome 1p was confirmed using STR markers D1S2672 (LOD score [Z]=3.56, recombination distance [theta]=0), and D1S2697 (Z=2.92, theta=0). Mutation profiling of positional-candidate genes detected a heterozygous transversion (c.2842G>T) in exon 17 of the gene coding for Eph-receptor type-A2 (EPHA2) that cosegregated with the disease. This missense change was predicted to result in the non-conservative substitution of a tryptophan residue for a phylogenetically conserved glycine residue at codon 948 (p.G948W), within a conserved cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. Candidate gene association analysis further identified SNPs in the EPHA2 region of chromosome 1p that were suggestively associated with age-related cataracts (p=0.007 for cortical cataracts, and p=0.01 for cortical and/or nuclear cataracts).These data provide the first evidence that EPHA2, which functions in the Eph-ephrin bidirectional signaling pathway of mammalian cells, plays a vital role in maintaining lens transparency.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19306328,Mutations of the EPHA2 receptor tyrosine kinase gene cause autosomal dominant congenital cataract.,"Congenital cataracts (CCs) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Mutations in the same gene may lead to CCs differing in inheritance, morphology and severity. Loci for autosomal dominant posterior polar CC and total CC have both been mapped to the chromosomal 1p36 region harboring the EPHA2 receptor tyrosine kinase gene. Here, we report mutations of EPHA2 in three CC families from different ancestral groups. In a Chinese family with posterior polar CC, we identified a missense mutation, c.2819C>T (p.T940I), replacing a critical amino acid that functions at the receptor oligomerization interface. In a British family with posterior polar CC and an Australian family with total CC, we found a frameshift mutation (c.2915_2916delTG) and a splicing mutation (c.2826-9G>A), respectively. These two mutations are predicted to produce novel C-terminal polypeptides with 39 identical amino acids. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed stronger interaction between the total CC-associated mutant EPHA2 and low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase, a negative regulator of EPHA2 signaling. Our results implicate the Eph-ephrin signaling system in development of human cataract and provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of human CCs.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
21912254,Molecular genetics of the blood group I system and the regulation of I antigen expression during erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The molecular genetics of the blood group I system and the regulation mechanism for I antigen expression in postnatal red blood cells are intriguing. This review summarizes their elucidation and recent findings. RECENT FINDINGS: Accumulating data from the molecular analysis of individuals with the adult i phenotype supports the proposed molecular genetic mechanism for the partial association of the adult i phenotype with congenital cataracts. Recent investigations have shown that the regulation of I antigen formation during erythropoiesis is determined by transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and the phosphorylation status of C/EBPα Ser-21 residue. SUMMARY: The human I locus is organized such that it has an uncommon genetic architecture and expresses three different I transcript forms. The results obtained from molecular analysis of two adult i groups, with and without congenital cataracts, demonstrate that the molecular background accounts for the partial association between these two traits and suggest that an I gene defect may lead directly to the development of congenital cataracts. Analysis of the regulation for I antigen expression shows that the regulation during erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis share a common mechanism, with dephosphorylation of the Ser-21 residue on C/EBPα playing the critical role.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
12089525,Mutant DNA-binding domain of HSF4 is associated with autosomal dominant lamellar and Marner cataract.,"Congenital cataracts cause 10-30% of all blindness in children, with one-third of cases estimated to have a genetic cause. Lamellar cataract is the most common type of infantile cataract. We carried out whole-genome linkage analysis of Chinese individuals with lamellar cataract, and found that the disorder is associated with inheritance of a 5.11-cM locus on chromosome 16. This locus coincides with one previously described for Marner cataract. We screened individuals of three Chinese families for mutations in HSF4 (a gene at this locus that encodes heat-shock transcription factor 4) and discovered that in each family, a distinct missense mutation, predicted to affect the DNA-binding domain of the protein, segregates with the disorder. We also discovered an association between a missense mutation and Marner cataract in an extensive Danish family. We suggest that HSF4 is critical to lens development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
12488604,"Two Novel Frame Shift, Recurrent and De Novo Mutations in the ITGB2 (CD18) Gene Causing Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency in a Highly Inbred North African Population.","We have identified four different mutations causing leukocyte adhesion Deficiency (LAD) in the ITGB2 gene of patients from a highly inbred population. Two were novel single-bp deletions (1497delG and 1920delG) causing frame shift and the two others were the missense mutations G284S and R593C. In our study, the G284S was a recurrent mutation while the R593C occurred de novo. We have also characterized a novel Xba1 polymorphic site located at the 5' end of the ITGB2 locus. Family studies showed that the 1497delG mutation segregated with this marker and the intragenic AvaII polymorphic marker, suggesting the presence of a founder effect. The observation of a heterogeneous spectrum including de novo and recurrent mutations causing LAD in a highly inbred population is rather unexpected. In view of the literature published on the molecular genetics of LAD and considering the ethnic origin of the patients studied, our findings confirm the heterogeneity of the mutations causing LAD and point out potential mutational hot spots in the ITGB2 gene.",research-article; journal article
11703376,"Characterization of four CD18 mutants in leucocyte adhesion deficient (LAD) patients with differential capacities to support expression and function of the CD11/CD18 integrins LFA-1, Mac-1 and p150,95.","Leucocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a hereditary disorder caused by mutations in the CD18 (beta2 integrin) gene. Four missense mutations have been identified in three patients. CD18(A270V) supports, at a diminished level, CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1, alphaMbeta2 integrin) and CD11c/CD18 (p150,95, alphaXbeta2 integrin) expression and function but not CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1, alphaLbeta2 integrin) expression. Conversely, CD18(A341P) supports a limited level of expression and function of CD11a/CD18, but not of the other two CD11/CD18 antigens. CD18(C590R) and CD18(R593C) show a decreasing capacity to associate with the CD11a, CD11c and CD11b subunits. Transfectants expressing the CD11a/CD18 with the C590R and R593C mutations are more adhesive than transfectants expressing wild-type LFA-1, and express the reporter epitope of the monoclonal antibody 24 constitutively. Thus, the four mutations affect CD18 differently in its capacities to support CD11/CD18 expression and adhesion. These results not only provide a biochemical account for the clinical diversity of patients with leucocyte adhesion deficiency, but also offer novel insights into the structural basis of interaction between the alpha and beta subunits, which is an integral component in our understanding of integrin-mediated adhesion and its regulation.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
26639818,Mutation spectra of the ITGB2 gene in Iranian families with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1.,"Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD1) is an autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by severe, recurrent bacterial infections, impaired pus formation and wound healing. It is caused by mutation in the ITGB2 gene, encoding the β2 integrin subunit of the leukocyte adhesion cell molecule. This study aimed to identify disease causing mutations in 19 consanguineous families diagnosed with LAD1. Blood samples were collected after informed and written consent was obtained. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of patients and their parents. PCR amplification of the ITGB2 gene was done using specific primers followed by sequencing for mutation detection. A total number of 14 alterations scattered throughout the ITGB2 gene were ascertained in which 10 mutations were previously reported, including c.329-6C>A, c.382G>T, c.715G>A, c.843delC, c.897+1G>A, c.1062A>T, c.1143delC, c.1877+2T>C, c.1907delA and c.2147G>C. Four novel likely pathogenic mutations consisting of c.576dupC (Asn193GlnfsX72), c.706G>A (Gly236Arg), c.897+1G>T and c.1030G>T (Glu344(∗)), were identified. The majority of these mutations were located in exon six, suggesting this exon as a hotspot region probably. This study emphasis on allelic heterogeneity of the ITGB2 gene in Iranian patients diagnosed with LAD1. Our results suggest that every population should develop a mutation database for rare genetic disorders to take advantage in genetic counseling clinic as well as genetic testing for rapid diagnostic purposes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
1347532,Identification of two molecular defects in a child with leukocyte adherence deficiency.,"Children with leukocyte adherence deficiency (LAD), or leukocyte cell adhesion molecule deficiency, experience recurrent, life-threatening bacterial infections related to severe deficiency in surface expression of the leukocyte integrin molecules. The leukocyte integrins consist of a common CD18 (beta) subunit and individual, noncovalently associated alpha subunits designated CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c. Defects in the CD18 subunit prevent surface expression of the CD11/CD18 complexes in children with this disease. We investigated the molecular basis of the disease in a child with the severe deficiency form of LAD and identified two molecular defects in the CD18 subunit. The first defect is a single-base pair C----T transposition resulting in an amino acid substitution of a leucine for a proline at amino acid 178. This amino acid substitution is located in a region that is highly conserved among the integrin beta subunits and where two previous defects have been located in LAD. The second mutation involves a deletion of 220 base pairs in the cDNA coding for a portion of the extracellular domain and results in a frameshift into a premature stop codon. The deleted region corresponds to a single exon in the CD18 gene. Identification of these two molecular defects in a single child with this disease indicates the compound heterozygous nature of the disorder in this child and identifies regions of the CD18 subunit that may be important for CD11/CD18 heterodimer formation and surface expression.",editorial

LAD-I is caused by mutations in the ITGB2 gene and characterized by recurrent severe bacterial infections, as well as impaired wound healing with lack of pus formation.In this study, we investigated ITGB2 gene mutations in 12 patients and their parents. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples. All coding regions of the ITGB2 gene were amplified using PCR and followed by direct sequencing.Genetic analysis revealed 12 different homozygous mutations, including six missense (c.382G>A, c.2146G>C, c.715G>A, c.691G>C, c.1777C and new c.1686C>A), two new nonsense (c.1336G>T and c.1821C>A), three-frame shift (c.1143delc, c.1907delA and new c.474dupC) and a splice site (c.1877+2T>C). Flow cytometry analysis of CD11/CD18 expression on neutrophils revealed defect in CD18 in all twelve cases (1.4% to 42%), CD11a in ten cases (0.1% to 26.7%), CD11b in nine cases (1.2% to 58.8%), and CD11c in all cases (0 % to 18.1%). The patients' parents were both heterozygous carriers.Our findings showed four new mutations in the ITGB2 gene.

3519653,"Clinical and laboratory features of patients with an inherited deficiency of neutrophil membrane complement receptor type 3 (CR3) and the related membrane antigens LFA-1 and p150,95.","Over the last 3 years a group of more than 20 patients has been described worldwide who have a similar history of recurrent bacterial infections and an inherited deficiency of three related leukocyte membrane surface antigens known as CR3, LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen type 1), and p150,95 (function unknown). These antigens share a common beta-chain structure linked noncovalently to one of three distinct alpha-chain types. It is believed that the patients with this disease have a reduced or absent ability to synthesize the common beta subunit of the antigen family, resulting in absent or reduced expression of all three antigen family members on different leukocyte types. Neutrophils have a reduced phagocytic and respiratory burst response to bacteria and yeast as well as a reduced ability to adhere to various substrates and migrate into sites of infection. In vitro functional studies of normal neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes treated with monoclonal antibodies to the individual alpha and beta chains of these antigens suggest that most of the clinical features of the patients may be due to the neutrophil and monocyte deficiency of CR3. Although natural killer-cell activity is diminished or absent, no immune deficiency of the patients' lymphocytes attributable to the absence of LFA-1 has been detected. Diagnosis of this disease has been facilitated by the commercial availability of monoclonal antibodies specific for the alpha chains of CR3 and p150,95.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
20385796,Modeling familial Danish dementia in mice supports the concept of the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Familial Danish dementia (FDD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with cerebral deposition of Dan-amyloid (ADan), neuroinflammation, and neurofibrillary tangles, hallmark characteristics remarkably similar to those in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have generated transgenic (tg) mouse models of familial Danish dementia that exhibit the age-dependent deposition of ADan throughout the brain with associated amyloid angiopathy, microhemorrhage, neuritic dystrophy, and neuroinflammation. Tg mice are impaired in the Morris water maze and exhibit increased anxiety in the open field. When crossed with TauP301S tg mice, ADan accumulation promotes neurofibrillary lesions, in all aspects similar to the Tau lesions observed in crosses between beta-amyloid (Abeta)-depositing tg mice and TauP301S tg mice. Although these observations argue for shared mechanisms of downstream pathophysiology for the sequence-unrelated ADan and Abeta peptides, the lack of codeposition of the two peptides in crosses between ADan- and Abeta-depositing mice points also to distinguishing properties of the peptides. Our results support the concept of the amyloid hypothesis for AD and related dementias, and suggest that different proteins prone to amyloid formation can drive strikingly similar pathogenic pathways in the brain.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
11895040,Familial Danish dementia: a novel form of cerebral amyloidosis associated with deposition of both amyloid-Dan and amyloid-beta.,"Familial Danish dementia (FDD) is pathologically characterized by widespread cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), parenchymal protein deposits, and neurofibrillary degeneration. FDD is associated with a mutation of the BRI2 gene located on chromosome 13. In FDD there is a decamer duplication, which abolishes the normal stop codon, resulting in an extended precursor protein and the release of an amyloidogenic fragment, ADan. The aim of this study was to describe the major neuropathological changes in FDD and to assess the distribution of ADan lesions, neurofibrillary pathology, glial, and microglial response using conventional techniques, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy. We showed that ADan is widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) in the leptomeninges, blood vessels, and parenchyma. A predominance of parenchymal pre-amyloid (non-fibrillary) lesions was found. Abeta was also present in a proportion of both vascular and parenchymal lesions. There was severe neurofibrillary pathology, and tau immunoblotting revealed a triplet electrophoretic migration pattern comparable with PHF-tau. FDD is a novel form of CNS amyloidosis with extensive neurofibrillary degeneration occurring with parenchymal, predominantly pre-amyloid rather than amyloid, deposition. These findings support the notion that parenchymal amyloid fibril formation is not a prerequisite for the development of neurofibrillary tangles. The significance of concurrent ADan and Abeta deposition in FDD is under further investigation.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
18425797,Mutations in GDF6 are associated with vertebral segmentation defects in Klippel-Feil syndrome.,"Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) is a congenital disorder of spinal segmentation distinguished by the bony fusion of anterior/cervical vertebrae. Scoliosis, mirror movements, otolaryngological, kidney, ocular, cranial, limb, and/or digit anomalies are often associated. Here we report mutations at the GDF6 gene locus in familial and sporadic cases of KFS including the recurrent missense mutation of an extremely conserved residue c.866T>C (p.Leu289Pro) in association with mirror movements and an inversion breakpoint downstream of the gene in association with carpal, tarsal, and vertebral fusions. GDF6 is expressed at the boundaries of the developing carpals, tarsals, and vertebrae and within the adult vertebral disc. GDF6 knockout mice are best distinguished by fusion of carpals and tarsals and GDF6 knockdown in Xenopus results in a high incidence of anterior axial defects consistent with a role for GDF6 in the etiology, diversity, and variability of KFS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 23 patients with KFS who were seen at our institution during a 10-year period. Sixteen of the 23 patients had undergone adequate axial view cross-sectional imaging of the upper cervical spine. The degree of neuroschisis was assessed for each patient, using an objective scoring system. Twelve patients were evaluated for the presence or absence of mirror movements. RESULTS: A high percentage of female patients with KFS was noted (17 [74%] of 23 patients). Adequate cross-sectional images were available for 16 of the 23 patients, six (38%) of whom had some form of cervicomedullary neuroschisis. Five of the six patients had been clinically evaluated, and all were shown to have mirror movements. One patient with Chiari II malformation, which obscured evaluation for neuroschisis, also had mirror movements. Of the remaining nine patients without cervicomedullary neuroschisis, six were evaluated, and none of the six had mirror movements. A review of the theoretical neuroanatomic basis of mirror movements is presented herein, and neurosurgical management concerns for patients with KFS are discussed. CONCLUSION: A strong association exists between cervicomedullary neuroschisis and mirror movements in cases of KFS. Screening of patients with mirror movements may help identify clinically unsuspected KFS and may also help stratify risk within this patient population, identifying patients who might benefit from early neurosurgical intervention.",journal article
22105858,Renal anomalies in Alagille syndrome: a disease-defining feature.,"Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is an autosomal dominant condition, primarily caused by mutations in JAGGED1. ALGS is defined by cholestatic liver disease, cardiac disease and involvement of the face, skeleton, and eyes with variable expression of these features. Renal involvement has been reported though not formally described. The objective of this study was to systematically characterize the renal involvement in ALGS. We performed a retrospective review of 466 JAGGED1 mutation-positive ALGS patients. Charts were reviewed for serum biochemistries, renal ultrasounds or other imaging, urinalysis, and clinical reports from pediatric nephrologists. The clinical data were reviewed by two pediatric hepatologists and a pediatric nephrologist. Of 466 charts reviewed we found 187 yielded evaluable renal information. Of these, 73/187 were shown to have renal involvement, representing 39% of the study cohort. Renal dysplasia was the most common anomaly seen. Genotype analysis of the JAGGED1 mutations in the patients with and without renal involvement did not reveal an association with mutation type. From the study we concluded that renal involvement has a prevalence of 39% in ALGS in our evaluable patients. Renal dysplasia is the most common renal anomaly. This finding correlates with the known role of the Notch pathway in glomerular development. Since renal disease of the type seen in ALGS can impair growth and impact liver transplantation, there is a clear need for a prospective study of renal involvement in ALGS and the development of guidelines for evaluation and management. These data also suggest that renal involvement be considered the sixth defining criterion for ALGS.",letter
12509572,Bleeding tendency in children with Alagille syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE:Spontaneous intracranial bleeding is now a widely recognized complication and cause of mortality in patients with Alagille syndrome. The pathogenesis of intracranial bleeding in these patients remains unclear. The aim of the study was to look for other sites of bleeding in these patients that could suggest a factor of multiorgan morbidity. METHODS:The records of 174 patients with Alagille syndrome were reviewed, and 38 (22%) patients without liver failure who experienced hemorrhage that led to a drop in hemoglobin level of at least 3 g/dL or to blood transfusion were identified. RESULTS:In 38 patients, 49 bleeding episodes occurred at a median age of 3.75 years (range: 1 month-27 years). Seventeen patients had 23 episodes of spontaneous bleeding; 21 patients bled during surgery or other medical procedures, and 5 among these 21 patients also had a spontaneous bleeding episode. Nine patients bled at least twice. Median platelets count and prothrombin time were normal. Severe cholestasis existed in 33 patients. One patient has a deletion of the 20p12 region, and 13 of 17 patients studied have a JAGGED1 mutation. Blood transfusion was necessary in 23 patients. Eight patients died secondary to bleeding (4 after surgery, 2 after gastrointestinal bleeding, 1 after needle liver biopsy, and 1 after intracranial bleeding). CONCLUSION:These results suggest that patients with Alagille syndrome are at special risk for bleeding; this should be taken into account before deciding on an invasive procedure. The mechanism of the bleeding is still unclear; the role of hypercholesterolemia cannot be excluded, but it may be speculated that JAGGED1 signaling abnormalities may impair the hemostatic function.",journal article

18805827,Mutation in the HPGD gene encoding NAD+ dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase underlies isolated congenital nail clubbing (ICNC).,"BACKGROUND: Isolated congenital nail clubbing (ICNC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by enlargement of the terminal segments of fingers and toes with thickened nails due to proliferation of the connective tissues and abnormal function of the nail matrix. In the present study, we investigated a large Pakistani family with 11 affected individuals having hereditary congenital nail clubbing as a single invariable clinical feature without any associated ectodermal, skeletal or systemic imperfection. OBJECTIVE: To identify a gene underlying the ICNC phenotype. METHODS: A genome wide homozygosity linkage mapping strategy was used to identify the gene causing ICNC. DNA sequencing was performed to screen 10 candidate genes located in the linkage interval. RESULTS: We assigned the disease locus for the ICNC to a 13.25 cM region on chromosome 4q32.3-q34.1. This region corresponds to 12.27 Mbp according to the sequence based physical map (Build 36.1) and flanked by markers D4S2952 and D4S415. A maximum two point LOD score of 2.98 ( theta= 0.00) was obtained at marker D4S2368 while a maximum multipoint LOD score of 3.62 was obtained with several markers along the disease interval. Sequence analysis of the candidate genes, in the ICNC linkage interval, revealed a homozygous missense mutation (c.577T>C; p.S193P) in exon 6 of the human HPGD gene encoding NAD(+) dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH).

12721955,Mutations of the PAX6 gene detected in patients with a variety of optic-nerve malformations.,"The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis and is expressed in the developing central nervous system and numerous ocular tissues during development. PAX6 mutations have been detected in various ocular anomalies, including aniridia, Peters anomaly, corneal dystrophy, congenital cataracts, and foveal hypoplasia. However, it has not been identified in patients with optic-nerve malformations. Here, we identified novel mutations in eight pedigrees with optic-nerve malformations, including coloboma, morning glory disc anomaly, optic-nerve hypoplasia/aplasia, and persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. A functional assay demonstrated that each mutation decreased the transcriptional activation potential of PAX6 through the paired DNA-binding domain. PAX6 and PAX2 are each thought to downregulate the expression of the other. Four of the detected mutations affected PAX6-mediated transcriptional repression of the PAX2 promoter in a reporter assay. Because PAX2 gene mutations were detected in papillorenal syndrome, alternation of PAX2 function by PAX6 mutations may affect phenotypic manifestations of optic-nerve malformations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; case-report"
9610810,A new family of Greek origin maps to the CRD locus for autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy on 19q.,"Retinal photoreceptor dystrophies (RD) are a highly heterogeneous group of genetic disorders of the retina, representing the most frequently inherited form of visual handicap, affecting approximately 1.5 million people world wide. To date, more than 40 genetic loci have been implicated in RD. One of them, the CORD2 locus, for an autosomal dominant form of cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), maps to chromosome 19q and has previously been reported in a single large family of British origin. We now report a new family with severe early onset CRD, phenotypically very similar to the British family, which also maps to 19q, but is of Greek origin. Haplotype data of the Greek family showed no recombination between and including markers D19S219 and D19S246 and linkage analysis gave a lod score of 2.7 (at theta=0) with marker D19S412, confirming the data obtained in the British family.",research-article; journal article
24136862,A novel heterozygous OPA3 mutation located in the mitochondrial target sequence results in altered steady-state levels and fragmented mitochondrial network.,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in OPA3 have been reported in patients with autosomal dominant optic atrophy plus cataract and Costeff syndrome. Here, we report the results of a comprehensive study on OPA3 mutations, including the mutation spectrum and its prevalence in a large cohort of OPA1-negative autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) patients, the associated clinical phenotype and the functional characterisation of a newly identified OPA3 mutant. METHODS: Mutation analysis was carried out in a patient cohort of 121 independent ADOA patients. To characterise a novel OPA3 mutation, we analysed the mitochondrial import, steady-state levels and the mitochondrial localisation of the mutated protein in patients' fibroblasts. Furthermore, the morphology of mitochondria harbouring the mutated OPA3 was monitored. RESULTS: We identified four independent cases (representing families with multiple affected members) with OPA3 mutations. Besides the known p.Q105E mutation, we observed a novel insertion, c.10_11insCGCCCG/p.V3_G4insAP which is located in the mitochondrial presequence. Detailed functional analysis of mitochondria harbouring this novel mutation demonstrates a fragmented mitochondrial network with a decreased mitochondrial mass in patient fibroblasts. In addition, quantification of the OPA3 protein reveals decreased steady-state levels of the mutant protein compared with the native one. Comparison of the clinical phenotypes suggests that OPA3 mutations can additionally evoke hearing loss and by that extend the clinical manifestation of OPA3-associated optic atrophy. This finding is supported by expression analysis of OPA3 in murine cochlear tissue. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study provides new insights into the clinical spectrum and the pathogenesis of dominant optic atrophy caused by mutations in the OPA3 gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
7864751,Chromosome 19q cone-rod retinal dystrophy. Ocular phenotype.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the phenotype in a family with dominantly inherited cone-rod dystrophy with chromosome assignment to a 19q locus, and to correlate this with current classifications of this retinal dystrophy. DESIGN: A detailed clinical examination including Goldmann perimetry was undertaken in all family members. Six members under the age of 30 years underwent dark-adapted electroretinography, color contrast-sensitivity measurement, dark-adapted static perimetry, and dark adaptometry. PATIENTS: The study included 34 affected and 22 unaffected patients in four generations of a pedigree that manifested autosomal dominant cone-rod retinal dystrophy linked to a chromosome 19q locus by genetic linkage analysis. RESULTS: Loss of visual acuity occurred in the first decade of life, onset of night blindness occurred after 20 years of age, and little visual function remained after the age of 50 years. Central and, later, peripheral retinal fundus changes were associated with central scotoma, pseudoaltitudinal field defects, and finally global loss of function. Psychophysical and electrophysiologic testing before the age of 26 years showed more marked loss of cone than rod function. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype associated with this mutation does not fit well into previous subtypes of cone-rod dystrophy. Further studies will be needed to correlate specific genetic mutations in this group of conditions with the various clinical phenotypes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15531334,Novel 615delC mutation in the CRX gene in a Japanese family with cone-rod dystrophy.,"PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical features of a Japanese family with cone-rod dystrophy associated with a novel 615delC mutation in the cone-rod homeobox (CRX) gene. DESIGN: Case reports and results of DNA analysis. METHODS: Mutational screening by direct sequencing was performed for the three exons in the CRX gene. The clinical features were evaluated by visual acuity measurements, electroretinography, and kinetic visual field testing. RESULTS: A 615delC mutation in the CRX gene was identified and found to cosegregate with cone-rod dystrophy. The ophthalmic findings included cone-rod dystrophy with negative-type electroretinograms (ERGs) and a rapid progression after the age of 40 years. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the 615delC mutation causes cone-rod dystrophy with a negative-type ERG. The genotype-phenotype correlation in the CRX gene in our patient and others reported in the literature suggest that the negative-type ERG might be a good sign for having a mutation in the CRX gene.",journal article; case reports
11754102,Ten novel FBN2 mutations in congenital contractural arachnodactyly: delineation of the molecular pathogenesis and clinical phenotype.,"Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is an autosomal dominant condition that shares skeletal features with Marfan syndrome (MFS), but does not have the ocular and cardiovascular complications that characterize MFS. CCA and MFS result from mutations in highly similar genes, FBN2 and FBN1, respectively. All the identified CCA mutations in FBN2 cluster in a limited region similar to where severe MFS mutations cluster in FBN1, specifically between exons 23 and 34. We screened exons 22 through 36 of FBN2 for mutations in 13 patients with classic CCA by single stranded conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and then by direct sequencing. We successfully identified 10 novel mutations in this critical region of FBN2 in these patients, indicating a mutation detection rate of 75% in this limited region. Interestingly, none of these identified FBN2 mutations alter amino acids in the calcium binding consensus sequence in the EGF-like domains, whereas many of the FBN1 mutations alter the consensus sequence. Furthermore, analysis of the clinical data of the CCA patients with characterized FBN2 mutation indicate that CCA patients have aortic root dilatation and the vast majority lack evidence of congenital heart disease. These studies have implications for our understanding of the molecular basis of CCA, along with the diagnosis and genetic counseling of CCA patients.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
16740166,Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (Beals syndrome).,"Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (Beals syndrome) is an autosomal dominantly inherited connective tissue disorder characterized by multiple flexion contractures, arachnodactyly, severe kyphoscoliosis, abnormal pinnae and muscular hypoplasia. It is caused by a mutation in FBN2 gene on chromosome 5q23. Although the clinical features can be similar to Marfan syndrome (MFS), multiple joint contractures (especially elbow, knee and finger joints), and crumpled ears in the absence of significant aortic root dilatation are characteristic of Beals syndrome and rarely found in Marfan syndrome. The incidence of CCA is unknown and its prevalence is difficult to estimate considering the overlap in phenotype with MFS; the number of patients reported has increased following the identification of FBN2 mutation. Molecular prenatal diagnosis is possible. Ultrasound imaging may be used to demonstrate joint contractures and hypokinesia in suspected cases. Management of children with CCA is symptomatic. Spontaneous improvement in camptodactyly and contractures is observed but residual camptodactyly always remains. Early intervention for scoliosis can prevent morbidity later in life. Cardiac evaluation and ophthalmologic evaluations are recommended.",review-article; review; journal article
26749309,Autosomal-Dominant Corneal Endothelial Dystrophies CHED1 and PPCD1 Are Allelic Disorders Caused by Non-coding Mutations in the Promoter of OVOL2.,"Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy 1 (CHED1) and posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy 1 (PPCD1) are autosomal-dominant corneal endothelial dystrophies that have been genetically mapped to overlapping loci on the short arm of chromosome 20. We combined genetic and genomic approaches to identify the cause of disease in extensive pedigrees comprising over 100 affected individuals. After exclusion of pathogenic coding, splice-site, and copy-number variations, a parallel approach using targeted and whole-genome sequencing facilitated the identification of pathogenic variants in a conserved region of the OVOL2 proximal promoter sequence in the index families (c.-339_361dup for CHED1 and c.-370T>C for PPCD1). Direct sequencing of the OVOL2 promoter in other unrelated affected individuals identified two additional mutations within the conserved proximal promoter sequence (c.-274T>G and c.-307T>C). OVOL2 encodes ovo-like zinc finger 2, a C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and acts as a direct transcriptional repressor of the established PPCD-associated gene ZEB1. Interestingly, we did not detect OVOL2 expression in the normal corneal endothelium. Our in vitro data demonstrate that all four mutated OVOL2 promoters exhibited more transcriptional activity than the corresponding wild-type promoter, and we postulate that the mutations identified create cryptic cis-acting regulatory sequence binding sites that drive aberrant OVOL2 expression during endothelial cell development. Our data establish CHED1 and PPCD1 as allelic conditions and show that CHED1 represents the extreme of what can be considered a disease spectrum. They also implicate transcriptional dysregulation of OVOL2 as a common cause of dominantly inherited corneal endothelial dystrophies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
9171831,Mutations in cornea-specific keratin K3 or K12 genes cause Meesmann's corneal dystrophy.,"The intermediate filament cytoskeleton of corneal epithelial cells is composed of cornea-specific keratins K3 and K12 (refs 1,2). Meesmann's corneal dystrophy (MCD) is an autosomal dominant disorder causing fragility of the anterior corneal epithelium, where K3 and K12 are specifically expressed. We postulated that dominant-negative mutations in these keratins might be the cause of MCD. K3 was mapped to the type-II keratin gene cluster on 12q; and K12 to the type-I keratin cluster on 17q using radiation hybrids. We obtained linkage to the K12 locus in Meesmann's original German kindred (Zmax = 7.53; theta = 0) and we also showed that the phenotype segregated with either the K12 or the K3 locus in two Northern Irish pedigrees. Heterozygous missense mutations in K3 (E509K) and in K12 (V143L; R135T) completely co-segregated with MCD in the families and were not found in 100 normal unrelated chromosomes. All mutations occur in the highly conserved keratin helix boundary motifs, where dominant mutations in other keratins have been found to severely compromise cytoskeletal function, leading to keratinocyte fragility phenotypes. Our results demonstrate for the first time the molecular basis of Meesmann's corneal dystrophy.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
2217484,Oncogene expression in prostate cancer.,"Molecular biology has proven to be instrumental in studies on the onset and progression of cancer. Reasoning that tumorigenesis can be considered as a multistep process in which a normal cell gradually escapes from its delicately regulated growth pattern, one might describe this process in terms of gene expression. The group of genes that are good candidates for investigation in this context are the proto-oncogenes. Recent progress in oncogene research, has led us to believe that the group of oncogenes is much greater in number than the fifty so far characterized, since all growth factor-, growth factor receptor-, signal transducer- and transcription regulating genes have a potency to become oncogenic. Recessive genes, such as tumor suppressor genes might be equally relevant to the onset and progression of cancer. In this paper we confine ourselves to the role of protooncogenes in urological cancers, in particular prostate cancer. The usefulness of these genes as markers of progression in prostate cancer will be discussed.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
19764039,Detailed assessment of the ear in Cornelia de Lange syndrome: comparison with a control sample using the new dysmorphology guidelines.,"The literature abounds with reports of malformation syndromes in which human external ears are variously described as dysplastic, abnormal, large/small, low set, typical, or in some way unusual. Rarely is the ear well illustrated or described in meaningful detail. With few exceptions, such as Down syndrome, there is no real understanding of the degree to which ear morphology is affected in a specific syndrome. This paper describes a retrospective attempt to apply the recently published Morphological Definitions of the ear to compare a control sample of convenience with a group of patients with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) (all six papers in this issue are available online, open access at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121641055/issue). Although this study has a number of limitations, it demonstrates that the method can be successfully applied and is capable of producing data that can be subjected to statistical analysis. The ears of the patients with CdLS were significantly different from the controls over a number of descriptors, the most significant of which included more frequent apparent posterior rotation, a shorter more serpiginous antihelical stem and sharper antihelical to inferior crus angle, a shorter crus helix, a more V-shaped incisura, and a smaller lobe.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23335591,Autosomal dominant spondylocostal dysostosis is caused by mutation in TBX6.,"In humans, congenital spinal defects occur with an incidence of 0.5-1 per 1000 live births. One of the most severe syndromes with such defects is spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD). Over the past decade, the genetic basis of several forms of autosomal recessive SCD cases has been solved with the identification of four causative genes (DLL3, MESP2, LFNG and HES7). Autosomal dominant forms of SCD have also been reported, but to date no genetic etiology has been described for these. Here, we have used exome capture and next-generation sequencing to identify a stoploss mutation in TBX6 that segregates with disease in two generations of one family. We show that this mutation has a deleterious effect on the transcriptional activation activity of the TBX6 protein, likely due to haploinsufficiency. In mouse, Tbx6 is essential for the patterning of the vertebral precursor tissues, somites; thus, mutation of TBX6 is likely to be causative of SCD in this family. This is the first identification of the genetic cause of an autosomal dominant form of SCD, and also demonstrates the potential of exome sequencing to identify genetic causes of dominant diseases even in small families with few affected individuals.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16953888,Cri du Chat syndrome.,"The Cri du Chat syndrome (CdCS) is a genetic disease resulting from a deletion of variable size occurring on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p-). The incidence ranges from 1:15,000 to 1:50,000 live-born infants. The main clinical features are a high-pitched monochromatic cry, microcephaly, broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, micrognathia, abnormal dermatoglyphics, and severe psychomotor and mental retardation. Malformations, although not very frequent, may be present: cardiac, neurological and renal abnormalities, preauricular tags, syndactyly, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism. Molecular cytogenetic analysis has allowed a cytogenetic and phenotypic map of 5p to be defined, even if results from the studies reported up to now are not completely in agreement. Genotype-phenotype correlation studies showed a clinical and cytogenetic variability. The identification of phenotypic subsets associated with a specific size and type of deletion is of diagnostic and prognostic relevance. Specific growth and psychomotor development charts have been established. Two genes, Semaphorin F (SEMAF) and delta-catenin (CTNND2), which have been mapped to the ""critical regions"", are potentially involved in cerebral development and their deletion may be associated with mental retardation in CdCS patients. Deletion of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, localised to 5p15.33, could contribute to the phenotypic changes in CdCS. The critical regions were recently refined by using array comparative genomic hybridisation. The cat-like cry critical region was further narrowed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and three candidate genes were characterised in this region. The diagnosis is based on typical clinical manifestations. Karyotype analysis and, in doubtful cases, FISH analysis will confirm the diagnosis. There is no specific therapy for CdCS but early rehabilitative and educational interventions improve the prognosis and considerable progress has been made in the social adjustment of CdCS patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article"

This term makes reference to the main clinical feature of the syndrome, a high-pitched monochromatic cat-like crying, that usually disappears in the first years of life. CdCS is one of the most common chromosomal deletion syndromes in humans, with an incidence of 1:15.000-1:50.000 live-births. Our purpose was to review different aspects of this syndrome (concept, epidemiology, aetiology, clinical features, diagnostic methods and prognosis) emphasizing both: the breakthrough in this field introduced by new cytogenetic and molecular techniques, and the orofacial manifestations most frequently reported. The main orofacial anomalies registered were mandibular microretrognathia, high palate but rarely cleft, variable malocclusion (frequently anterior open-bite), enamel hypoplasia, poor oral hygiene, generalized chronic periodontitis, and retardation of tooth eruption, although there is not enough evidence to support any clear association between these pathologies and the CdCS.",review; journal article

The combination of ISH and immunocytochemical techniques on the same or adjacent tissue sections provides a more complete picture of the various changes in gene expression. ISH may also detect posttranscriptional abnormalities of gene expression at the cellular level, such as expression of mRNA with no protein translation, or translation with decreased efficiency. Undoubtedly, the development of the ISH technique will open a new area for the understanding of the complex molecular events leading to cancer.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"

Sixty-six families of children and adults diagnosed with CCS completed the Behaviour Problems Inventory. Additional information relating to gender, chronological age, type of school/post-school occupation and medication was also included in the survey. Stereotyped behaviour was reported for 82% of subjects, more than half the sample displaying it on a daily basis. The occurrence percentage of 15 topographies of SIB suggested that head banging, hitting the head against body parts, self-biting and rumination are the most frequently occurring behaviours in CCS. Aggressive behaviour was reported for 88%, with a statistically significant negative correlation between age and the number of aggressive behaviours reported. The present findings suggest that specific types of stereotypy and SIB are observed frequently in CCS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Twenty-six children aged between 6 years 4 months and 15 years 5 months (mean 8 years 3 months) completed a battery of tasks measuring IQ level, receptive and expressive language skills, and articulation. Twenty-four children were in the severe learning-disability range with no specific verbal or performance profile. Using more finely tuned measures of cognition, however, a clear discrepancy in the pattern of language functioning was found with better receptive than expressive language skills. One implication of these findings is that parents and professionals should be more optimistic about the capacities of children with CDCS to understand more complex verbal commands than their expressive language skills would suggest.",journal article
30802441,Loss-of-function mutations in FREM2 disrupt eye morphogenesis.,"Cryptophthalmos is a rare congenital disorder characterized by ocular dysplasia with eyelid malformation. Complete cryptophthalmos is characterized by the presence of continuous skin from the forehead over the eyes and onto the cheek, along with complete fusion of the eyelids. In the present study, we characterized the clinical manifestations of three patients with isolated bilateral cryptophthalmos. These patients shared the same c.6499C > T missense mutation in the FRAS1-related extracellular matrix protein 2 (FREM2) gene, while each individual presented an additional nonsense mutation in the same gene (Patient #1, c.2206C > T; Patient #2, c.5309G > A; and Patient #3, c.4063C > T). Then, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mice carrying Frem2R725X/R2156W compound heterozygous mutations, and showed that these mice recapitulated the human isolated cryptophthalmos phenotype. We detected FREM2 expression in the outer plexiform layer of the retina for the first time in the cryptophthalmic eyes, and the levels were comparable to the wild-type mice. Moreover, a set of different expressed genes that may contribute secondarily to the phenotypes were identified by performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the fetal Frem2 mutant mice. Our findings extend the spectrum of FREM2 mutations, and provide insights into opportunities for the prenatal diagnosis of isolated cryptophthalmos. Furthermore, our work highlights the importance of the FREM2 protein during the development of eyelids and the anterior segment of the eyeballs, establishes a suitable animal model for studying epithelial reopening during eyelid development and serves as a valuable reference for further mechanistic studies of the pathogenesis of isolated cryptophthalmos.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Despite the establishment of this disease in 1982, it has been pointed out that DRPLA has an unexplained aspect concerning its clinicopathological features; that is, the discrepancy between the variety of clinical manifestations and the uniformity of the brain lesions. The discovery of a causative gene mutation (abnormal expansion of the CAG repeat in DRPLA gene) triggered the development of novel neuropathology in DRPLA, which has suggested that polyglutamine-related pathogenesis involves a wide range of central nervous system regions far beyond the systems previously reported to be affected. It is now likely that DRPLA has an aspect of neuronal storage disorder and has multiple system degeneration, the lesion distribution of which varies depending on the CAG repeat sizes in the causative gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

We identified a previously unknown missense substitution in ADGRE2 (also known as EMR2), which was predicted to result in the replacement of cysteine with tyrosine at amino acid position 492 (p.C492Y), as the only nonsynonymous variant cosegregating with vibratory urticaria in two large kindreds. The ADGRE2 receptor undergoes autocatalytic cleavage, producing an extracellular subunit that noncovalently binds a transmembrane subunit.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed skull lesions at an early stage. Because the findings are reminiscent of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), collagen types I, III, and V were analyzed in fibroblasts and shown to be normal in terms of quantities, proportions, electrophoretic mobility, and thermostability.

FISH analysis using chromosome 8 radiation hybrid LIA2L indicated a concurrent deletion within the 8q rearranged region. These results were corroborated by STR-PCR analysis and FISH using YAC contig WC8.8 disclosed a deletion in 8q13. Comparison of the two known patients with Duane syndrome associated with deletion of 8q identifies a small region of overlap (SRO) of < 3 cM extending from D8S533 and D8S1767 in which a Duane syndrome locus is assigned. In addition YAC analysis in our patient showed that 8q rearrangement was rather complex since 8q deletion and insertion occurred in two distinct segments separated by a region which maintained its location on 8q.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

The etiopathogenesis of this condition can be explained by a spectrum of mechanical, innervational, neurologic and genetic abnormalities occurring independently or which influence each other giving rise to patterns of clinical presentations along with a complex set of ocular and systemic anomalies. Huber type I DRS is the most common form of DRS with an earlier presentation, while Huber type II is the least common presentation. Usually, patients with unilateral type I Duane syndrome have esotropia more frequently than exotropia, those with type II have exotropia and those with type III have esotropia and exotropia occurring equally common. Cases of bilateral DRS may have variable presentation depending upon the type of presentation in each eye. As regards its management, DRS classification based on primary position deviation as esotropic, exotropic or orthotropic is more relevant than Huber's classification before planning surgery.

25459316,Endoscopic transcanal removal of symptomatic external auditory canal exostoses.,"Exostoses are bony outgrowths of the external auditory canal (EAC) that can lead to cerumen entrapment, recurrent infections, and conductive hearing loss. When surgical removal is indicated, a drill or osteotome may be used via a post-auricular, endaural, or transcanal approach. Studies suggest that exostoses removed by transcanal osteotome result in decreased morbidity when compared to open, drilled approaches; however, inadvertent injury to the facial nerve or inner ear is a theoretical concern given the restrictive geometry of the EAC and challenges of visualizing the tip of the chisel through the microscope. The endoscope provides superior visualization of the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane compared to the microscope.

9557891,"Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: revised nosology, Villefranche, 1997. Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation (USA) and Ehlers-Danlos Support Group (UK).","Categorization of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes began in the late 1960s and was formalized in the Berlin nosology. Over time, it became apparent that the diagnostic criteria established and published in 1988 did not discriminate adequately between the different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes or between Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and other phenotypically related conditions. In addition, elucidation of the molecular basis of several Ehlers-Danlos syndromes has added a new dimension to the characterization of this group of disorders. We propose a revision of the classification of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes based primarily on the cause of each type. Major and minor diagnostic criteria have been defined for each type and complemented whenever possible with laboratory findings. This simplified classification will facilitate an accurate diagnosis of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and contribute to the delineation of phenotypically related disorders.","historical article; research support, non-u.s. gov't; practice guideline; guideline; journal article"
12180144,Prevalence of aortic root dilation in the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.,"PURPOSE:To determine the prevalence of proximal aortic abnormalities in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). METHODS:In a prospective cohort study, aortic measurements by two-dimensional echocardiography were performed on consecutive EDS patients. RESULTS:Twenty-eight percent (20 of 71) had aortic root dilation (ARD) (> +2 SD above population based norms). Fourteen of 42 individuals with the classical form of EDS (types I/II) and 6 of 29 individuals with the hypermobile form (type III) had ARD, with no gender differences. CONCLUSION:ARD is a common finding in EDS. Longitudinal studies are indicated to determine progression of ARD and its clinical significance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
9783710,A single base mutation in COL5A2 causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II.,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders. Recently mutations have been found in the genes for type V collagen in a small number of people with the most common forms of EDS, types I and II. Here we characterise a COL5A2 mutation in an EDS II family. Cultured dermal fibroblasts obtained from an affected subject synthesised abnormal type V collagen. Haplotype analysis excluded COL5A1 but was concordant with COL5A2 as the disease locus. The entire open reading frame of the COL5A2 cDNA was directly sequenced and a single base mutation detected. It substituted a glycine residue within the triple helical domain (G934R) of alpha2(V) collagen, typical of the dominant negative changes in other collagens, which cause various other inherited connective tissue disorders. All three affected family members possessed the single base change, which was absent in 50 normal chromosomes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
28306229,The 2017 international classification of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes.,"The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Over the past two decades, the Villefranche Nosology, which delineated six subtypes, has been widely used as the standard for clinical diagnosis of EDS. For most of these subtypes, mutations had been identified in collagen-encoding genes, or in genes encoding collagen-modifying enzymes. Since its publication in 1998, a whole spectrum of novel EDS subtypes has been described, and mutations have been identified in an array of novel genes. The International EDS Consortium proposes a revised EDS classification, which recognizes 13 subtypes. For each of the subtypes, we propose a set of clinical criteria that are suggestive for the diagnosis. However, in view of the vast genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability of the EDS subtypes, and the clinical overlap between EDS subtypes, but also with other HCTDs, the definite diagnosis of all EDS subtypes, except for the hypermobile type, relies on molecular confirmation with identification of (a) causative genetic variant(s). We also revised the clinical criteria for hypermobile EDS in order to allow for a better distinction from other joint hypermobility disorders. To satisfy research needs, we also propose a pathogenetic scheme, that regroups EDS subtypes for which the causative proteins function within the same pathway. We hope that the revised International EDS Classification will serve as a new standard for the diagnosis of EDS and will provide a framework for future research purposes.

24922459,Survival is affected by mutation type and molecular mechanism in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS type IV).,"PURPOSE: We sought to characterize the natural history of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in individuals with heterozygous COL3A1 mutations. METHODS: We reviewed clinical records for details of vascular, bowel, and organ complications in 1,231 individuals (630 index cases and 601 relatives). RESULTS: Missense and splice-site mutations accounted for more than 90% of the 572 alterations that we had identified in COL3A1. Median survival was 51 years but was influenced by gender (lower in men) and by the type of mutation. CONCLUSION: Although vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome appears to be genetically homogeneous, allelic heterogeneity is marked, and the natural history varies with gender and type of mutation in COL3A1. These findings indicate that when counseling families, confirmation of the presence of a COL3A1 mutation and its nature can help evaluate the risks of complications. These data are also important ingredients in both the selection and allocation of individuals to appropriate arms in clinical trials to assess the effects of interventions.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31438591,Further Defining the Phenotypic Spectrum of B3GAT3 Mutations and Literature Review on Linkeropathy Syndromes.,"The term linkeropathies (LKs) refers to a group of rare heritable connective tissue disorders, characterized by a variable degree of short stature, skeletal dysplasia, joint laxity, cutaneous anomalies, dysmorphism, heart malformation, and developmental delay. The LK genes encode for enzymes that add glycosaminoglycan chains onto proteoglycans via a common tetrasaccharide linker region. Biallelic variants in XYLT1 and XYLT2, encoding xylosyltransferases, are associated with Desbuquois dysplasia type 2 and spondylo-ocular syndrome, respectively. Defects in B4GALT7 and B3GALT6, encoding galactosyltransferases, lead to spondylodysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (spEDS). Mutations in B3GAT3, encoding a glucuronyltransferase, were described in 25 patients from 12 families with variable phenotypes resembling Larsen, Antley-Bixler, Shprintzen-Goldberg, and Geroderma osteodysplastica syndromes. Herein, we report on a 13-year-old girl with a clinical presentation suggestive of spEDS, according to the 2017 EDS nosology, in whom compound heterozygosity for two B3GAT3 likely pathogenic variants was identified. We review the spectrum of B3GAT3-related disorders and provide a comparison of all LK patients reported up to now, highlighting that LKs are a phenotypic continuum bridging EDS and skeletal disorders, hence offering future nosologic perspectives.",research-article; review; journal article; case reports
3597773,Mutant forms of spectrin alpha-subunits in hereditary elliptocytosis.,"Two variant spectrins have been described in hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) and pyropoikilocytosis (HPP). Both are characterized by increased susceptibility of the alpha I (N-terminal) 80-kD domain to mild tryptic digestion, yielding peptides of 46-50 or 65-68 kD (T50a and T68 in our terminology). In this report we add a third unstable spectrin alpha I domain found in three kindreds with HE; alpha IT80 in this type of spectrin is cleaved by mild tryptic digestion to a 50-kD peptide (T50b) distinguished from T50a by its more basic isoelectric point. All three spectrins show impaired self-association to form oligomers. Intermediate tryptic peptides of the three unstable alpha I domains from HE spectrins were characterized by monoclonal immunoblotting and I125 limit peptide mapping and affinity purified using polyclonal anti-alpha IT80. Partial amino acid sequences of alpha I domain peptides were obtained from two unrelated patients for each of the three variant spectrins. T50a results from cleavage at arginine 250 or lysine 252 of alpha IT80; a proline replaced the normal leucine or serine at residues 254 and 255, respectively. T50b and a 19-kD peptide result from cleavage at arginine 462 or arginine 464; a proline replaced the normal residue 465 (in T19b) in one of the two patients studied. T68 results from cleavage at arginine 131. In both 68-kD peptides examined, a leucine is inserted at residue 150. The relationship of the sequence changes to the new tryptic cleavages, to the current model of alpha I domain structure, and to defective spectrin self-association is discussed.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27667160,Genotype-phenotype correlations in hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis.,"Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) are heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders that result from mutations in the genes encoding α-spectrin (SPTA1), β-spectrin (SPTB), or protein 4.1R (EPB41). The resulting defects alter the horizontal cytoskeletal associations and affect RBC membrane stability and deformability causing shortened RBC survival. The clinical diagnosis of HE and HPP relies on identifying characteristic RBC morphology on peripheral blood smear and specific membrane biomechanical properties using osmotic gradient ektacytometry. However, this phenotypic diagnosis may not be readily available in patients requiring frequent transfusions, and does not predict disease course or severity. Using Next-Generation sequencing, we identified the causative genetic mutations in fifteen patients with clinically suspected HE or HPP and correlated the identified mutations with the clinical phenotype and ektacytometry profile. In addition to identifying three novel mutations, gene sequencing confirmed and, when the RBC morphology was not evaluable, identified the diagnosis. Moreover, genotypic differences justified the phenotypic differences within families with HE/HPP.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23511928,Mild Beckwith-Wiedemann and severe long-QT syndrome due to deletion of the imprinting center 2 on chromosome 11p.,"We report on a young woman admitted to our Cardiology Unit because of an episode of cardiac arrest related to a long-QT syndrome (LQTS). This manifestation was part of a broader phenotype, which was recognized as a mild form of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Molecular analysis confirmed the diagnosis of BWS owing to a maternally inherited deletion of the centromeric imprinting center, or ICR2, an extremely rare genetic mechanism in BWS. The deletion interval (198 kb) also included exons 11-16 of the KCNQ1 gene, known to be responsible for LQTS at locus LQT1. No concomitant mutations were found in any other of the known LQT genes. The proposita's mother carries the same deletion in her paternal chromosome and shows manifestations of the Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). This report describes the smallest BWS-causing ICR2 deletion and provides the first evidence that a paternal deletion of ICR2 leads to a SRS-like phenotype. In addition, our observation strongly suggests that in cases of LQTS due to mutation of the KCNQ1 gene (LQT1), an accurate clinical genetic evaluation should be done in order to program the most appropriate genetic tests.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

31263451,Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1): An Update and the Significance of Early Genetic and Clinical Diagnosis.,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary tumor syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and characterized by a predisposition to a multitude of endocrine neoplasms primarily of parathyroid, enteropancreatic, and anterior pituitary origin, as well as nonendocrine neoplasms. Other endocrine tumors in MEN1 include foregut carcinoid tumors, adrenocortical tumors, and rarely pheochromocytoma. Nonendocrine manifestations include meningiomas and ependymomas, lipomas, angiofibromas, collagenomas, and leiomyomas. MEN1 is caused by inactivating mutations of the tumor suppressor gene MEN1 which encodes the protein menin. This syndrome can affect all age groups, with 17% of patients developing MEN1-associated tumors before 21 years of age. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of MEN1-associated tumors, patients with MEN1 continue to have decreased life expectancy primarily due to malignant neuroendocrine tumors. The most recent clinical practice guidelines for MEN1, published in 2012, highlight the need for early genetic and clinical diagnosis of MEN1 and recommend an intensive surveillance approach for both patients with this syndrome and asymptomatic carriers starting at the age of 5 years with the goal of timely detection and management of MEN1-associated neoplasms and ultimately decreased disease-specific morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation and individual mutation-dependent surveillance is not possible currently.",review-article; review; journal article
15894597,"Camurati-Engelmann disease: review of the clinical, radiological, and molecular data of 24 families and implications for diagnosis and treatment.","Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare autosomal dominant type of bone dysplasia. This review is based on the unpublished and detailed clinical, radiological, and molecular findings in 14 CED families, comprising 41 patients, combined with data from 10 other previously reported CED families. For all 100 cases, molecular evidence for CED was available, as a mutation was detected in TGFB1, the gene encoding transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1. Pain in the extremities was the most common clinical symptom, present in 68% of the patients. A waddling gait (48%), easy fatigability (44%), and muscle weakness (39%) were other important features. Radiological symptoms were not fully penetrant, with 94% of the patients showing the typical long bone involvement. A large percentage of the patients also showed involvement of the skull (54%) and pelvis (63%). The review provides an overview of possible treatments, diagnostic guidelines, and considerations for prenatal testing. The detailed description of such a large set of CED patients will be of value in establishing the correct diagnosis, genetic counselling, and treatment.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article"
20301335,Camurati-Engelmann Disease,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is characterized by hyperostosis of the long bones and the skull, proximal muscle weakness, limb pain, a wide-based, waddling gait, and joint contractures. Facial features such as macrocephaly, frontal bossing, enlargement of the mandible, proptosis, and cranial nerve impingement resulting in facial palsy are seen in severely affected individuals later in life. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of CED is established in a proband with the characteristic radiographic findings or on identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TGFB1 by molecular genetic testing if radiographic findings are inconclusive. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Corticosteroid therapy as needed to control symptoms; losartan may be a helpful adjuvant therapy to minimize the need for steroids to control pain. Pain is also managed with analgesics and non-pharmacologic methods. Craniectomy may be needed to reduce intracranial pressure and relieve symptoms in individuals with several cranial sclerosis. Bilateral myringotomy can improve conductive hearing loss resulting from serous otitis. Prevention of secondary complications: Monitor blood pressure in individuals treated with corticosteroids and treat hypertension if necessary; individuals taking losartan also need regular blood pressure monitoring due to the increased risk for hypotension; taper corticosteroid dose as tolerated to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and compression fractures of the spine. Surveillance: Following initiation of corticosteroid treatment, blood pressure should be monitored monthly; when maintenance steroid dose is achieved, yearly evaluation includes complete neurologic examination, CBC, blood pressure, audiology evaluation, ophthalmology evaluation, and bone density scan; routine monitoring of linear growth in children due to the possible side effect of delayed or stunted growth; individuals with cranial hyperostosis (including those treated surgically) should continue to be monitored for signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. GENETIC COUNSELING:CED is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Penetrance is reduced. The incidence of de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with CED has a 50% chance of inheriting the TGFB1 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible options for families in which the pathogenic variant has been identified.",book; review
29620655,Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes in Camurati-Engelmann disease: A case series.,"Camurati-Engelmann disease is an extremely rare disease characterized by hyperostosis of multiple long bones. This condition is caused by heterozygous mutations in the TGFB1 gene.We describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of 4 Korean patients with this rare disease diagnosed at Asan Medical Center in Korea between June 2012 and May 2016, to increase awareness about this condition among general physicians and orthopedists. The presenting features, biochemical findings, radiographic and nuclear imaging findings, molecular analysis, and treatment outcomes of 4 patients were reviewed retrospectively.Two patients had sporadic disease, whereas the other 2 were familial cases. The average age at symptom onset was 8.8 ± 5.5 (4-14) years. Symptoms included waddling gait or leg pain. Bone pain and easy fatigability were documented in all patients. Skeletal deformities such as osteoporosis, genu valgum, and severe scoliosis were observed. Visual and otologic manifestations presenting as exophthalmos, retinal detachment, and vestibulopathy were found in 3 patients. Skeletal survey showed diaphyseal expansion with diffuse cortical thickening of long bones in all patients. Bone scintigraphy images showed increased uptake of radioactive material in the calvarium and diaphysis of long bones. The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 46.5 ± 22.2 (20-72) mm/h. Sequence analysis of TGFB1 revealed the previously reported mutations p.Arg218His, p.Arg218Cys, and p.Glu169Lys. Corticosteroid was effective in relieving pain, and losartan was used as maintenance therapy.Our experience suggests that this rare condition can be suspected in patients with characteristic symptoms and skeletal findings.

9758611,Familial eosinophilia maps to the cytokine gene cluster on human chromosomal region 5q31-q33.,"Familial eosinophilia (FE) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by peripheral hypereosinophilia of unidentifiable cause with or without other organ involvement. To localize the gene for FE, we performed a genomewide search in a large U.S. kindred, using 312 different polymorphic markers. Seventeen affected subjects, 28 unaffected bloodline relatives, and 8 spouses were genotyped. The initial linkage results from the genome scan provided evidence for linkage on chromosome 5q31-q33. Additional genotyping of genetic markers located in this specific region demonstrated significant evidence that the FE locus is situated between the chromosome 5q markers D5S642 and D5S816 (multipoint LOD score of 6.49). Notably, this region contains the cytokine gene cluster, which includes three genes-namely, those for interleukin (IL)-3, IL-5, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-whose products play important roles in the development and proliferation of eosinophils. These three cytokine genes were screened for potential disease-specific mutations by resequencing of a subgroup of individuals from the present kindred. No functional sequence polymorphisms were found within the promoter, the exons, or the introns of any of these genes or within the IL-3/GM-CSF enhancer, suggesting that the primary defect in FE is not caused by a mutation in any one of these genes but, rather, is caused by another gene in the area.",research-article; journal article
6465701,Circulating eosinophil colony-forming cells in pure eosinophil aplasia.,"Using a methylcellulose clonal culture method, we found eosinophil colony-forming cells in the blood of two patients: a 46-year-old white woman with a long history of urticaria and allergic rhinitis and complete absence of eosinophils secondary to IgG-mediated and complement-mediated destruction of her eosinophils; and a white woman with a history of allergic rhinitis and asthma and a complete absence of eosinophils in her peripheral blood. Addition of the patients' plasma or IgG to cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from normal persons or the patients inhibited formation of eosinophil colonies without influencing colony formation in other hemopoietic cell lineages. In contrast, normal plasma or IgG had no effect on the formation of eosinophil colonies. That the IgG-mediated cytotoxic activity of eosinophils prevents the expression of an apparently normal eosinophilopoietic potential suggests an autoimmune basis for the eosinophil aplasia.",review-article; review; journal article

11407989,Expression of a truncated keratin 5 may contribute to severe palmar--plantar hyperkeratosis in epidermolysis bullosa simplex patients.,"Epidermolysis bullosa simplex are dominant disorders of skin fragility characterized by intraepidermal blistering upon mild mechanical trauma. Skin fragility is caused by expression of either an abnormal keratin 5 or an abnormal keratin 14 protein, which compromises the structure and function of the keratin cytoskeleton of basal cells. We report an epidermolysis bullosa simplex patient with a novel single base substitution (A-->T1414) that changes the lysine residue at amino acid 472 to a non-sense codon (K472X). This change predicts the synthesis of a truncated keratin 5, missing 119 amino acids, including the entire tail domain and the highly conserved KLLEGE motif at the carboxy terminus of the 2B domain of the central rod. Expression of an altered keratin 5, of predicted mass and pI for the product of the K472X allele, was documented by one- and two-dimensional western blots of protein extracts from patient skin. Ultrastructural analysis of the patient's nonhyperkeratotic skin was remarkable for basal keratinocytes with dense and irregular keratin filaments proximal to the basement membrane. Keratinocytes, transfected with a cDNA carrying the A-->T1414 non-sense mutation, overexpressed a truncated keratin 5, and showed a disorganized and collapsed keratin filament cytoskeleton. This is the second epidermolysis bullosa simplex patient reported with a premature termination mutation in the KLLEGE motif. The remarkable occurrence of severe palmar--plantar hyperkeratosis in both patients suggests that the keratin 5 tail domain may have unrecognized, but important, normal functions in palmar-plantar tissues.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article; case reports"
3372762,Epidermolysis bullosa herpetiformis Dowling-Meara in a large family.,"A large Arab family, originating from Jerusalem, including 38 affected members (19 male and 19 female) with epidermolysis bullosa herpetiformis Dowling-Meara over four consecutive generations is described. Fourteen of 38 affected members of the family were examined clinically; their ages ranged from 2 to 35. The main clinical features were bullae, generalized, solitary, and in groups, with predilection to the skin of the palms and soles. Mild to moderate patchy hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles was found in 5 affected members of the family; their ages ranged from 2 to 7; 9 other affected adults were free. Blisters in oral mucous membranes were noted and found in summer and in periods of fever; hair, teeth, and nails were normal. Age of onset of the disease was from birth to 2 weeks. Expressivity appeared equally variable within and between sibships. Improvement was noted by progression of age from 5 to 23 years, and by some in summer and by others in winter. In contrast to previous reports, aggravation of the disease was noted during fever periods. Ultrastructural studies from a fresh blister disclosed intraepidermal blister via cytolysis of basal cell cytoplasm. The pedigree shows the transmission of an autosomal dominant gene. Affection of both consanguineous parents and their six offspring with epidermolysis bullosa herpetiformis Dowling-Meara is the most striking feature of the family--probably 25% of their offspring were homozygote.",journal article; case reports
11851880,A site-specific plectin mutation causes dominant epidermolysis bullosa simplex Ogna: two identical de novo mutations.,"Plectin is one of the largest and most versatile cytolinker proteins known. In basal keratinocytes it links the intermediate filament network to cell membrane-associated hemidesmosomes. Several mutations in its gene have been identified that lead to the recessive disease epidermolysis bullosa with muscular dystrophy. We report here a mutation that leads to a dominant form of the disease, epidermolysis bullosa simplex Ogna. We found that the epidermolysis bullosa simplex Ogna phenotype is due to a site-specific missense mutation within plectin's rod domain. Further, we show that epidermolysis bullosa simplex Ogna is not restricted to a single Norwegian kindred as previously believed. A German family with the phenotypic hallmarks of epidermolysis bullosa simplex Ogna was found to carry an identical de novo mutation. These two mutations arose about 200 y apart in time. Consistent with the absence of muscular symptoms in these patients, muscle biopsies from several epidermolysis bullosa simplex Ogna members of the Norwegian kindred showed normal staining patterns using antibodies to plectin. Skin changes in epidermolysis bullosa simplex Ogna patients are documented on the ultrastructural level.",journal article
10192393,A common human skin tumour is caused by activating mutations in beta-catenin.,"WNT signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs. In response to this stimulus, cytoplasmic beta-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1) is stabilized, enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the LEF/TCF family. One of the target genes for beta-catenin/TCF encodes c-MYC, explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to cancer, particularly in the colon. Most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin, but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Recently, we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas. Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Here, we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour. We found nuclear LEF-1 in the dividing tumour cells, providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells. At least 75% of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein. This percentage of CTNNB1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far, and directly implicates beta-catenin/LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; evaluation studies; journal article"
17666408,MYH11 mutations result in a distinct vascular pathology driven by insulin-like growth factor 1 and angiotensin II.,"Non-syndromic thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAADs) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in approximately 20% of cases. Familial TAAD is genetically heterogeneous and four loci have been mapped for this disease to date, including a locus at 16p for TAAD associated with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The defective gene at the 16p locus has recently been identified as the smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific myosin heavy chain gene (MYH11). On sequencing MYH11 in 93 families with TAAD alone and three families with TAAD/PDA, we identified novel mutations in two families with TAAD/PDA, but none in families with TAAD alone. Histopathological analysis of aortic sections from two individuals with MYH11 mutations revealed SMC disarray and focal hyperplasia of SMCs in the aortic media. SMC hyperplasia leading to significant lumen narrowing in some of the vessels of the adventitia was also observed. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was upregulated in mutant aortas as well as explanted SMCs, but no increase in transforming growth factor-beta expression or downstream targets was observed. Enhanced expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme and markers of Angiotensin II (Ang II) vascular inflammation (macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha and beta) were also found. These data suggest that MYH11 mutations are likely to be specific to the phenotype of TAAD/PDA and result in a distinct aortic and occlusive vascular pathology potentially driven by IGF-1 and Ang II.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
14985375,"Mutations in SCN9A, encoding a sodium channel alpha subunit, in patients with primary erythermalgia.","Primary erythermalgia is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterised by intermittent burning pain with redness and heat in the extremities. A previous study established the linkage of primary erythermalgia to a 7.94 cM interval on chromosome 2q, but the causative gene was not identified. We performed linkage analysis in a Chinese family with primary erythermalgia, and screened the mutations in the two candidate genes, SCN9A and GCA, in the family and a sporadic patient. Linkage analysis yielded a maximum lod score of 2.11 for both markers D2S2370 and D2S2330. Based on critical recombination events in two patients in the family, we further limited the genetic region to 5.98 cM between D2S2370 and D2S2345. We then identified two missense mutations in SCN9A in the family (T2573A) and the sporadic patient (T2543C). Our data suggest that mutations in SCN9A cause primary erythermalgia. SCN9A, encoding a voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit predominantly expressed in sensory and sympathetic neurones, may play an important role in nociception and vasomotor regulation.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18234728,"BHD mutations, clinical and molecular genetic investigations of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome: a new series of 50 families and a review of published reports.","BACKGROUND:Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS) (MIM 135150) is an autosomal dominant predisposition to the development of follicular hamartomas (fibrofolliculomas), lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and kidney neoplasms. Germline mutations in BHD are associated with the susceptibility for BHDS. We previously described 51 BHDS families with BHD germline mutations. OBJECTIVE:To characterise the BHD mutation spectrum, novel mutations and new clinical features of one previously reported and 50 new families with BHDS. METHODS:Direct bidirectional DNA sequencing was used to screen for mutations in the BHD gene, and insertion and deletion mutations were confirmed by subcloning. We analysed evolutionary conservation of folliculin by comparing human against the orthologous sequences. RESULTS:The BHD mutation detection rate was 88% (51/58). Of the 23 different germline mutations identified, 13 were novel consisting of: four splice site, three deletions, two insertions, two nonsense, one deletion/insertion, and one missense mutation. We report the first germline missense mutation in BHD c.1978A>G (K508R) in a patient who presented with bilateral multifocal renal oncocytomas. This mutation occurs in a highly conserved amino acid in folliculin. 10% (5/51) of the families had individuals without histologically confirmed fibrofolliculomas. Of 44 families ascertained on the basis of skin lesions, 18 (41%) had kidney tumours. Patients with a germline BHD mutation and family history of kidney cancer had a statistically significantly increased probability of developing renal tumours compared to patients without a positive family history (p = 0.0032). Similarly, patients with a BHD germline mutation and family history of spontaneous pneumothorax had a significantly increased greater probability of having spontaneous pneumothorax than BHDS patients without a family history of spontaneous pneumothorax (p = 0.011). A comprehensive review of published reports of cases with BHD germline mutation is discussed. CONCLUSION:BHDS is characterised by a spectrum of mutations, and clinical heterogeneity both among and within families.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
28830849,Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome: characteristic CT findings differentiating it from other diffuse cystic lung diseases.,"Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is an uncommon, autosomal dominant, multiorgan systemic disorder manifesting as cutaneous fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts with or without spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal tumors. Spontaneous pneumothorax and lung cysts on chest computed tomography (CT) should lead to the inclusion of BHD syndrome in the differential diagnosis, because these findings may develop earlier than other clinical manifestations. Here, we review and describe the characteristic findings of BHD syndrome. The number, shape, size, and distribution of the lung cysts can help to differentiate BHD syndrome from other diffuse cystic lung diseases. Knowledge of the chest CT findings of BHD syndrome may lead to a correct diagnosis and the initiation of an appropriate work-up in order to prevent pneumothorax and for the early detection of renal tumors.",research-article; review; journal article
9835964,[Multiple trichodiscomas associated with colonic polyposis],"BACKGROUND: Trichodiscoma is an uncommon benign tumor of the pilosebaceous system. CASE REPORT: An 83-year-old man had a past history of adenomatous polyps of the colon. The subject's brother had died from cancer of the colon. Over the past 4 years, the patient had developed approximately 30 small asymptomatic papulonodular tumors on the trunk. Skin biopsy demonstrated trichodiscomas. DISCUSSION: Together with fibrofolliculomas and perifollicular fibromas, trichodiscomas are benign tumors of the pilosebaceous system. These different tumors may occur simultaneously as in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome which associates trichodiscoma and familial colonic polyposis. This combination has only been reported in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome or with perifollicular fibromas. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that patients with hamartomas of the pilosebaceous system should undergo explorations in search for digestive tract polyposis.",journal article; english abstract; case reports

3985833,Familial congenital fourth cranial nerve palsy.,"Few reports of hereditary transmission patterns in congenital superior oblique palsy have been made in the past. In this study, three families with congenital superior oblique palsies have been identified and examined. Two members of each family had a superior oblique palsy. After full history, eye examination, and sensory testing, the patterns in each family have been analyzed. Deviations varied from binocular fusion and orthophoria to large vertical deviations, especially in adduction. Sensory patterns were compatible with the congenital nature of the palsy. A discussion of possible causes for a congenital superior oblique palsy is offered and the congenital superior oblique palsies are analyzed. A definite genetic transmission pattern could not be found, but possible explanations are considered. Regardless of etiology, therapy for this problem is unchanged from that for all superior oblique palsies. Occurrences of congenital trochlear palsies in multiple family members should be considered when a patient with this problem is diagnosed.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; validation studies; randomized controlled trial; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19291768,Autosomal dominant inheritance in a large family with focal facial dermal dysplasia (Brauer-Setleis syndrome).,"Focal facial dermal dysplasia (FFDD) (OMIM 227260) is a rare ectodermal disorder characterized by congenital bitemporal scar-like depressions resembling forceps marks and variable additional facial manifestations. No gene defects or gene loci for FFDD are known to date. We report on a large multi-generational German family with typical characteristics of FFDD and provide a detailed clinical description of four affected individuals. They had large bitemporal discolored dermal depressions, sparse lateral eyebrows, abnormal eyelashes, and dysplastic and low-set ears. Three of the four affected individuals had congenital horizontal nystagmus, which had hitherto only been reported in a single patient with FFDD. In contrast to previous assumptions about an autosomal recessive etiology of this disorder, this family provides further evidence that FFDD is inherited in an autosomal dominant mode. Although this family is not large enough to yield significant results in linkage analysis, it may, in combination with other families, contribute to the identification of a gene locus for this intriguing ectodermal disorder.",journal article; case reports
17632779,Genochondromatosis type II: report of a new patient and further delineation of the phenotype.,"Enchondromas are common intraosseous usually benign cartilaginous tumors that develop in close proximity to growth plate cartilage. Genochondromatosis is a familial skeletal condition with autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Genochondromatosis type I is a skeletal disorder characterized by symmetrical chondromatosis with characteristic localization: clavicle, upper end of humerus, and lower end of femur. The condition shows a benign course and is clearly different from metachondromatosis, generalized enchondromatosis, and spondyloenchondrodysplasia. In contrast, genochondromatosis type II is characterized by normal clavicles, but metaphyseal involvement of the hands, feet, knees, and wrists. To date, one family has been described with two affected individuals and possibly a second one with seven affected individuals. We report here on a boy with radiographic features of genochondromatosis type II. This report confirms that this disorder represents a separate clinical entity distinguishable for genochondromatosis type I. In addition, this report confirms the benign course of this rare disorder and will help accurate genetic counseling.",journal article; case reports
23392294,Multiple congenital melanocytic nevi and neurocutaneous melanosis are caused by postzygotic mutations in codon 61 of NRAS.,"Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) can be associated with neurological abnormalities and an increased risk of melanoma. Mutations in NRAS, BRAF, and Tp53 have been described in individual CMN samples; however, their role in the pathogenesis of multiple CMN within the same subject and development of associated features has not been clear. We hypothesized that a single postzygotic mutation in NRAS could be responsible for multiple CMN in the same individual, as well as for melanocytic and nonmelanocytic central nervous system (CNS) lesions. From 15 patients, 55 samples with multiple CMN were sequenced after site-directed mutagenesis and enzymatic digestion of the wild-type allele. Oncogenic missense mutations in codon 61 of NRAS were found in affected neurological and cutaneous tissues of 12 out of 15 patients, but were absent from unaffected tissues and blood, consistent with NRAS mutation mosaicism. In 10 patients, the mutation was consistently c.181C>A, p.Q61K, and in 2 patients c.182A>G, p.Q61R. All 11 non-melanocytic and melanocytic CNS samples from 5 patients were mutation positive, despite NRAS rarely being reported as mutated in CNS tumors. Loss of heterozygosity was associated with the onset of melanoma in two cases, implying a multistep progression to malignancy. These results suggest that single postzygotic NRAS mutations are responsible for multiple CMN and associated neurological lesions in the majority of cases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
9618168,Mutation in the RIEG1 gene in patients with iridogoniodysgenesis syndrome.,"Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) and iridogoniodysgenesis syndrome (IGDS) are clinically related autosomal dominant disorders which affect the anterior segment of the eye as well as non-ocular structures. ARS patients present with iris hypoplasia, a prominent Schwalbe line, adhesions between the iris stroma and the iridocorneal angle and increased intraocular pressure. IGDS is characterized by iris hypoplasia, goniodysgenesis and increased intraocular pressure. Each syndrome also presents with non-ocular features including maxillary hypoplasia, micro and anodontia, redundant periumbilical skin, hypospadius (in males), and each has been genetically linked to chromosome 4q25. RIEG1 , the gene responsible for the 4q25 ARS phenotype, recently has been cloned. RIEG1 encodes a novel member of the bicoid class of homeobox proteins known to be active as transcription factors. Mutational analysis has previously detected several mutations in this gene in ARS individuals. We have now detected a mutation in RIEG1 which segregates with the disease phenotype in a family with IGDS. This mutation is a G-->A transition altering an arginine residue to a histidine in a highly conserved location in the second helix of the homeobox of RIEG1. This mutation indicates that IGDS and ARS are allelic variants of the same disorder. This wide variability in clinical consequences of mutations at the RIEG1 4q25 locus implicates the RIEG gene broadly in ocular and craniofacial disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15930087,Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta and their related phenotypes.,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF-1beta) is a widely distributed transcription factor which plays a critical role in embryonic development of the kidney, pancreas, liver, and Mullerian duct. Thirty HNF-1beta mutations have been reported in patients with renal cysts and other renal developmental disorders, young-onset diabetes, pancreatic atrophy, abnormal liver function tests, and genital tract abnormalities.We sequenced the HNF-1beta gene in 160 unrelated subjects with renal disease, 40% of whom had a personal/family history of diabetes.Twenty three different heterozygous HNF-1beta mutations were identified in 23/160 subjects (14%), including 10 novel mutations (V61G, V110G, S148L, K156E, Q176X, R276Q, S281fsinsC, R295P, H324fsdelCA, Q470X). Seven (30%) cases were proven to be due to de novo mutations. Renal cysts were found in 19/23 (83%) patients (four with glomerulocystic kidney disease, GCKD) and diabetes in 11/23 (48%, while three other families had a family history of diabetes. Only 26% of families met diagnostic criteria for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) but 39% had renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD). We found no clear genotype/phenotype relationships.We report the largest series to date of HNF-1beta mutations and confirm HNF-1beta mutations as an important cause of renal disease. Despite the original description of HNF-1beta as a MODY gene, a personal/family history of diabetes is often absent and the most common clinical manifestation is renal cysts. Molecular genetic testing for HNF-1beta mutations should be considered in patients with unexplained renal cysts (including GCKD), especially when associated with diabetes, early-onset gout, or uterine abnormalities.","letter; research support, non-u.s. gov't; case-report"
15068978,Clinical spectrum associated with hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta mutations.,"BACKGROUND:Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5), a type of dominantly inherited diabetes mellitus and nephropathy, has been associated with mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta (HNF-1beta) gene, mostly generating truncated protein. Various phenotypes, including urogenital malformations, are related to HNF-1beta mutations. OBJECTIVE:To describe clinical and genetic findings in 13 patients with 8 novel HNF-1beta mutations. DESIGN:Multicenter, descriptive study. SETTING:2 departments of diabetes, 1 department of internal medicine, and 1 department of nephrology. PARTICIPANTS:8 probands with diabetes diagnosed before 40 years of age and nondiabetic kidney disease who were selected independent of their family history of diabetes, and 5 offspring. MEASUREMENTS:Characteristics of diabetes, renal function and structure, genital tract abnormalities, pancreas structure, insulin secretion, exocrine pancreas function, and liver test results. RESULTS:All mutations, including 5 missense changes, were found in the DNA-binding domain. Cosegregation of the mutation and MODY5 phenotype was observed in 4 families. Occurrence of a de novo mutation was demonstrated in 2 families. Diabetes was present in 10 of 13 mutation carriers. It was clinically overt in 5 participants and found by screening at age 19 to 38 years in 5 participants. Pancreas atrophy was observed in 5 of 6 probands, and pancreas exocrine insufficiency was observed in 6 of 7 probands. Renal involvement, consisting of structural changes and slowly progressive renal failure, was recognized in 9 patients at 18 to 41 years of age. Dysplastic kidneys were found by ultrasonography in 3 fetuses who subsequently showed transient neonatal renal failure. Genital tract abnormalities were present in 5 probands and liver enzyme levels were abnormal in 11 of 13 patients. LIMITATIONS:Since the study was small and not population-based, it could not estimate the prevalence of MODY5. Other phenotypes might be associated with HNF-1beta mutations. CONCLUSIONS:Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 encompasses a wide clinical spectrum. Analysis for mutations of HNF-1beta is warranted, even without a family history of diabetes, in nonobese patients with diabetes and slowly progressive nondiabetic nephropathy, particularly when pancreatic atrophy or genital abnormalities are present.",multicenter study; journal article

Here we show that mutations in NBEAL2 (neurobeachin-like 2), which encodes a BEACH/ARM/WD40 domain protein, cause GPS and that megakaryocytes and platelets from individuals with GPS express a unique combination of NBEAL2 transcripts. Proteomic analysis of sucrose-gradient subcellular fractions of platelets indicated that NBEAL2 localizes to the dense tubular system (endoplasmic reticulum) in platelets.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
22243968,A restricted spectrum of mutations in the SMAD4 tumor-suppressor gene underlies Myhre syndrome.,"Myhre syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by reduced growth, generalized muscular hypertrophy, facial dysmorphism, deafness, cognitive deficits, joint stiffness, and skeletal anomalies. Here, by performing exome sequencing of a single affected individual and coupling the results to a hypothesis-driven filtering strategy, we establish that heterozygous mutations in SMAD4, which encodes for a transducer mediating transforming growth factor β and bone morphogenetic protein signaling branches, underlie this rare Mendelian trait. Two recurrent de novo SMAD4 mutations were identified in eight unrelated subjects. Both mutations were missense changes altering Ile500 within the evolutionary conserved MAD homology 2 domain, a well known mutational hot spot in malignancies. Structural analyses suggest that the substituted residues are likely to perturb the binding properties of the mutant protein to signaling partners. Although SMAD4 has been established as a tumor suppressor gene somatically mutated in pancreatic, gastrointestinal, and skin cancers, and germline loss-of-function lesions and deletions of this gene have been documented to cause disorders that predispose individuals to gastrointestinal cancer and vascular dysplasias, the present report identifies a previously unrecognized class of mutations in the gene with profound impact on development and growth.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (IDP), a putative autoimmune disorder presenting in an acute (AIDP) or a chronic form (CIDP), has been rarely reported as familial. We present a father and two daughters of Jewish Kurdish origin who developed IDP within 10 years. The unusual familial history led us to reevaluate the diagnosis of IDP, and suggested an autosomal dominant pedigree. DNA analysis identified the deletion typical of HNPP on chromosome 17. Screening for the HNPP deletion in patients with atypical, recurrent, or familial IDP might be warranted.",journal article; case reports

Family study in five probands (three males and two females) suggests an autosomal-dominant sex-limited inheritance of this entity, probably linked to the genes for beard hairs, which is peculiar to males in South India and Sri Lanka. There has been an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus in the affected group. A control study made in a similar population of 1030 (680 male and 350 female) individuals attending the general medical and surgical out-patient clinics revealed hairy ears in 23.1% (237 male adults and one female adult).",journal article

Data from the clinical assessment of both familial and isolated cases were used to define the HOS phenotype and to outline the spectrum of abnormalities, especially factors affecting severity. Skeletal defects affected the upper limbs exclusively and were bilateral and asymmetrical. They ranged from minor signs such as clinodactyly, limited supination, and sloping shoulders to severe reduction deformities of the upper arm (4.5%). The radial ray was predominantly affected than the right. All affected cases showed evidence of upper limb involvement. Cardiac defects were seen in 95% of familial cases and included both atrial septal defect (ASD, 34%) and ventricular septal defect (VSD, 25%); 39% had only ECG changes. Cardiac involvement ranged from asymptomatic conduction disturbances to multiple structural defects requiring surgery in infancy. Sudden death could be caused by heart block. Inheritance was autosomal dominant with 100% penetrance and no evidence of reduced fitness. Increasing severity occurred in succeeding generations consistent with anticipation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
18309337,Clinical features of the congenital vitreoretinopathies.,"The inherited vitreoretinal degenerations or vitreoretinopathies are characterized by congenital and acquired disorders of the eye including early onset cataract, anomalies of the vitreous manifesting as optically empty vitreous, course fibrils, and membranes, and retinal detachment. These diseases include Stickler syndrome types I (STL1) and II (STL2), usually caused by mutations in COL2A1 and COL11A1 respectively. Wagner syndrome (WGN1) is associated with mutations in versican (CSPG2) and snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration (SVD) with a mutation in a potassium channel (KCNJ13). The cataract is often cortical and may be wedge-shaped, but does not distinguish between the different syndromes. The congenital vitreous defect is usually characterized as fibrillar degeneration (STL2, WGN1, and SVD) or as a vestigial membrane just behind the lens (STL1). Peripheral chorioretinal atrophy with nyctalopia is prominent in WGN1. Intraretinal crystals may be visible in the periphery using a contact lens in SVD and corneal guttae, a flat appearance to the optic nerve head and mild atrophy of the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium are also common features. Other vitreoretinal degenerations including a number of chondrodysplasias in addition to STL1 and STL2, enhanced S-cone syndrome caused by mutations in NR2E3, and autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy caused by mutations in VMD2 are discussed. Patients with unexplained early onset cataract or retinal detachment should be carefully evaluated for vitreoretinal degeneration. Theses diseases share overlapping clinical features with common complex traits affecting the eye (myopia, corneal endothelial dystrophy, lattice degeneration), and may provide insight into the mechanisms of common eye diseases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
12192490,Epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma of Vörner: re-evaluation of Vörner's original family and identification of a novel keratin 9 mutation.,"In 1901, Hans Vörner observed a family with a diffuse non-transgredient palmoplantar keratoderma of autosomal dominant inheritance. Histopathologically, he found epidermolytic hyperkeratosis as a characteristic sign and diagnostic criterion of this disorder. We performed a follow-up study of the family originally seen by Vörner in 1901 with clinical, histopathological, and molecular investigations. Clinically, affected family members showed the typical diffuse keratoses over the entire surface of the palms and soles sharply bordered by red margins. A mycotic infection was additionally found in two patients examined. Histopathological investigations confirmed epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. Molecular studies revealed a novel mutation in keratin 9, N160I, in patients from the family. The mutation in the coil-1A domain is thought to have a dominant negative effect on the assembly of keratin intermediate filaments, explaining the dominant inheritance of the phenotype. These findings give further evidence that palmoplantar keratoderma of Vörner represents the same entity as palmoplantar keratoderma of Thost, which was recently re-evaluated in Thost's original family and shown to be caused by a similar mutation, R162 W, in the same segment of keratin 9.","historical article; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
4718953,"Hyperlipidemia in coronary heart disease. II. Genetic analysis of lipid levels in 176 families and delineation of a new inherited disorder, combined hyperlipidemia.","To assess the genetics of hyperlipidemia in coronary heart disease, family studies were carried out in 2520 relatives and spouses of 176 survivors of myocardial infarction, including 149 hyperlipidemic and 27 normolipidemic individuals. The distribution of fasting plasma cholesterol and triglyceride values in relatives, together with segregation analyses, suggested the presence of five distinct lipid disorders. Three of these-familial hypercholesterolemia, familial hypertriglyceridemia, and familial combined hyperlipidemia-appeared to represent dominant expression of three different autosomal genes, occurring in about 20% of survivors below 60 yr of age and 7% of all older survivors. Two other disorders-polygenic hypercholesterolemia and sporadic hypertriglyceridemia-each affected about 6% of survivors in both age groups. The most common genetic form of hyperlipidemia identified in this study has hitherto been poorly defined and has been designated as familial combined hyperlipidemia. Affected family members characteristically had elevated levels of both cholesterol and triglyceride. However, increased cholesterol or increased triglyceride levels alone were also frequently observed. The combined disorder was shown to be genetically distinct from familial hypercholesterolemia and familial hypertriglyceridemia for the following reasons: (a) the distribution pattern of cholesterol and triglyceride levels in relatives of probands was unique; (b) children of individuals with combined hyperlipidemia did not express hypercholesterolemia in contrast to the finding of hypercholesterolemic children from families with familial hypercholesterolemia; and (c) analysis of informative matings suggested that the different lipid phenotypes owed their origin to variable expression of a single autosomal dominant gene and not to segregation of two separate genes, such as one elevating the level of cholesterol and the other elevating the level of triglyceride. Heterozygosity for one of the three lipid-elevating genes identified in this study may have a frequency in the general population of about 1%, constituting a major problem in early diagnosis and preventive therapy.",research-article; journal article
12738753,Biochemical and genetic association of plasma apolipoprotein A-II levels with familial combined hyperlipidemia.,"Apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) is a major protein on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, and in mice, its levels are associated with triglyceride and glucose metabolism. In particular, transgenic mice overexpressing apoA-II exhibit hypertriglyceridemia, increased body fat, and insulin resistance, whereas apoA-II-null mice have decreased triglycerides and increased insulin sensitivity. Given the phenotypic overlap between familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) and apoA-II transgenic mice, we investigated the relationship of apoA-II to this disorder. Despite having lower HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), FCH subjects had higher apoA-II levels compared with unaffected relatives (P<0.00016). Triglyceride and HDL-C levels were significant predictors of apoA-II, demonstrating that apoA-II variation is associated with several FCH-related traits. After adjustment for multiple covariates, there was evidence for the heritability of apoA-II levels (h2=0.15; P<0.02) in this sample. A genome scan for apoA-II levels identified significant evidence (LOD=3.1) for linkage to a locus on chromosome 1q41, coincident with a suggestive linkage for triglycerides (LOD score=1.4). Thus, this locus may have pleiotropic effects on apoA-II and FCH traits. Our results demonstrate that apoA-II is biochemically and genetically associated with FCH and may serve as a useful marker for understanding the mechanism by which FCH develops.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
21368769,KITLG mutations cause familial progressive hyper- and hypopigmentation.,"Familial progressive hyper- and hypopigmentation (FPHH) is thought to be an autosomal dominant disorder with reduced penetrance. Clinical signs consist of progressive diffuse, partly blotchy hyperpigmented lesions, multiple café-au-lait spots, intermingled with scattered hypopigmented-appearing maculae, and lentigines. FPHH is distinct from familial progressive hyperpigmentation (FPH), in which no hypopigmented features are present, and which is phenotypically and histologically closer to Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditaria 2 (DUH2). It also differs from the Legius syndrome, characterized by familial café-au-lait spots and skin fold freckling, caused by mutations in SPRED1. We performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in seven families with FPHH, and identified linkage on 12q21.12-q22, which overlaps with the DUH2 locus. We investigated whether KITLG in the locus is mutated in FPHH. We discovered three different mutations in four families. A reported FPH substitution was observed in two FPHH families, and two, to our knowledge, previously unreported substitutions, p.Val33Ala and p.Thr34Pro, cosegregated with FPHH in two separate families. All three mutations were located in a conserved β-strand in KITLG, suggesting its important role in the activation of the KITLG receptor c-Kit. In aggregate, mutations in a single gene cause various pigmentation disorders: FPH, FPHH, and likely DUH2. Therefore, KITLG is an important modulator of skin pigmentation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19375057,Gain-of-function mutation of KIT ligand on melanin synthesis causes familial progressive hyperpigmentation.,"Familial progressive hyperpigmentation (FPH) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited disorder characterized by hyperpigmented patches in the skin, present in early infancy and increasing in size and number with age. The genetic basis for FPH remains unknown. In this study, a six-generation Chinese family with FPH was subjected to a genome-wide scan for linkage analysis. Two-point linkage analysis mapped the locus for FPH at chromosome 12q21.31-q23.1, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 4.35 (Ã˜ = 0.00) at D12S81. Haplotype analysis confined the locus within an interval of 9.09 cM, flanked by the markers D12S1667 and D12S2081. Mutation profiling of positional candidate genes detected a heterozygous transversion (c. 107A-->G) in exon 2 of the KIT ligand (KITLG) gene, predicted to result in the substitution of a serine residue for an asparagine residue at codon 36 (p.N-->S). This mutant ""G"" allele cosegregated perfectly with affected, but not with unaffected, members of the FPH family. Function analysis of the soluble form of sKITLG revealed that mutant sKITLGN36S increased the content of the melanin by 109% compared with the wild-type sKITLG in human A375 melanoma cells. Consistent with this result, the tyrosinase activity was significantly increased by mutant sKITLGN36S compared to wild-type control. To our knowledge, these data provided the first genetic evidence that the FPH disease is caused by the KITLGN36S mutation, which has a gain-of-function effect on the melanin synthesis and opens a new avenue for exploration of the genetic mechanism of FPH.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23802516,Mutations affecting G-protein subunit α11 in hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia.,"Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with three variants: types 1, 2, and 3. Type 1 is due to loss-of-function mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptor that signals through the G-protein subunit α11 (Gα11). Type 3 is associated with adaptor-related protein complex 2, sigma 1 subunit (AP2S1) mutations, which result in altered calcium-sensing receptor endocytosis. We hypothesized that type 2 is due to mutations effecting Gα11 loss of function, since Gα11 is involved in calcium-sensing receptor signaling, and its gene (GNA11) and the type 2 locus are colocalized on chromosome 19p13.3. We also postulated that mutations effecting Gα11 gain of function, like the mutations effecting calcium-sensing receptor gain of function that cause autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1, may lead to hypocalcemia.We performed GNA11 mutational analysis in a kindred with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 2 and in nine unrelated patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia who did not have mutations in the gene encoding the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) or AP2S1. We also performed this analysis in eight unrelated patients with hypocalcemia who did not have CASR mutations. In addition, we studied the effects of GNA11 mutations on Gα11 protein structure and calcium-sensing receptor signaling in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells.The kindred with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 2 had an in-frame deletion of a conserved Gα11 isoleucine (Ile200del), and one of the nine unrelated patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia had a missense GNA11 mutation (Leu135Gln). Missense GNA11 mutations (Arg181Gln and Phe341Leu) were detected in two unrelated patients with hypocalcemia; they were therefore identified as having autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 2. All four GNA11 mutations predicted disrupted protein structures, and assessment on the basis of in vitro expression showed that familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 2-associated mutations decreased the sensitivity of cells expressing calcium-sensing receptors to changes in extracellular calcium concentrations, whereas autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 2-associated mutations increased cell sensitivity.Gα11 mutants with loss of function cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 2, and Gα11 mutants with gain of function cause a clinical disorder designated as autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 2.

Patients with disorders of the parathyroid gland have higher incidences of hypertension, arrhythmias, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and calcific disease which translate into increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. Importantly, clinical research also suggests that early treatment of parathyroid disorders through medical or surgical management may reverse cardiovascular remodeling and mitigate cardiac risk factors.",research-article; review; journal article
29663634,Barakat syndrome revisited.,"Barakat syndrome also known as HDR syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] 146255), was first described by Barakat et al. in . It is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the triad of hypoparathyroidism ""H,"" sensorineural deafness ""D,"" and renal disease ""R."" The defect is caused by deletions in chromosome 10p14 or mutations in the GATA3 gene. Although the syndrome has been phenotypically defined by this triad the literature identifies cases with different components with, or without GATA3 defects making the definition of the syndrome confusing. We analyzed 180 cases and attempted to define the phenotype of the syndrome and suggest guidelines for diagnosis. We suggest that the diagnosis could be confirmed in patients who have all three components, and in those who have two components with a positive family history. GATA3 testing is optional to establish the diagnosis in these patients. The syndrome should be considered in patients with isolated ""D"" where other causes of ""D"" have been excluded and those with isolated ""R,"" especially if there is family history of any of these components. In these instances, confirmatory GATA3 testing is indicated to confirm the diagnosis. In patients with nonsurgical ""H,"" where ""D"" and ""R"" have been conclusively ruled out GATA3 studies are not needed as none of these patients were shown to be GATA3 haploinsufficient. Only 64.4% of patients in our review had ""HDR."" Some findings might have not been recognized or may could have appeared later in life, but it is evident that this syndrome is genotypically heterogeneous.",review; journal article
26604140,Urogenital development in Pallister-Hall syndrome is disrupted in a cell-lineage-specific manner by constitutive expression of GLI3 repressor.,"Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in GLI3 that produce a transcriptional repressor (GLI3R). Individuals with PHS present with a variably penetrant variety of urogenital system malformations, including renal aplasia or hypoplasia, hydroureter, hydronephrosis or a common urogenital sinus. The embryologic mechanisms controlled by GLI3R that result in these pathologic phenotypes are undefined. We demonstrate that germline expression of GLI3R causes renal hypoplasia, associated with decreased nephron number, and hydroureter and hydronephrosis, caused by blind-ending ureters. Mice with obligate GLI3R expression also displayed duplication of the ureters that was caused by aberrant common nephric duct patterning and ureteric stalk outgrowth. These developmental abnormalities are associated with suppressed Hedgehog signaling activity in the cloaca and adjacent vesicular mesenchyme. Mice with conditional expression of GLI3R were utilized to identify lineage-specific effects of GLI3R. In the ureteric bud, GLI3R expression decreased branching morphogenesis. In Six2-positive nephrogenic progenitors, GLI3R decreased progenitor cell proliferation reducing the number of nephrogenic precursor structures. Using mutant mice with Gli3R and Gli3 null alleles, we demonstrate that urogenital system patterning and development is controlled by the levels of GLI3R and not by an absence of full-length GLI3. We conclude that the urogenital system phenotypes observed in PHS are caused by GLI3R-dependent perturbations in nephric duct patterning, renal branching morphogenesis and nephrogenic progenitor self-renewal.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
20301638,Pallister-Hall Syndrome,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Pallister-Hall syndrome (referred to as PHS in this entry) is characterized by a spectrum of anomalies ranging from polydactyly, asymptomatic bifid epiglottis, and hypothalamic hamartoma at the mild end to laryngotracheal cleft with neonatal lethality at the severe end. Individuals with mild PHS may be incorrectly diagnosed as having isolated postaxial polydactyly type A. Individuals with PHS can have pituitary insufficiency and may die as neonates from undiagnosed and untreated adrenal insufficiency. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of Pallister-Hall syndrome can be established in a proband with both hypothalamic hamartoma and mesoaxial polydactyly. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in GLI3 confirms the diagnosis. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Urgent treatment for endocrine abnormalities, especially cortisol deficiency; management of epiglottic abnormalities depending on the abnormality and the extent of respiratory compromise. Bifid epiglottis, the most common abnormality, typically does not need treatment. Standard treatment of anal atresia or stenosis; symptomatic treatment of seizures; elective repair of polydactyly; developmental intervention or special education for developmental delays. Prevention of secondary complications: Biopsy or resection of hypothalamic hamartoma may result in complications and lifelong need for hormone replacement; seizures may begin or worsen with use of stimulants for attention deficit disorder. Surveillance: During childhood, annual developmental assessment and annual medical evaluation to assess growth and monitor for signs of precocious puberty. GENETIC COUNSELING:Pallister-Hall syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Individuals with PHS may have an affected parent or may have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. About 25% of individuals have a de novo pathogenic variant. Persons with a de novo pathogenic variant are generally more severely affected than those with a family history of PHS. The risk to offspring of an affected individual is 50%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known. The reliability of ultrasound examination for prenatal diagnosis is unknown.",book; review
24736735,New insights into genotype-phenotype correlation for GLI3 mutations.,"The phenotypic spectrum of GLI3 mutations includes autosomal dominant Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) and Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS). PHS was first described as a lethal condition associating hypothalamic hamartoma, postaxial or central polydactyly, anal atresia and bifid epiglottis. Typical GCPS combines polysyndactyly of hands and feet and craniofacial features. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been found both for the location and the nature of GLI3 mutations, highlighting the bifunctional nature of GLI3 during development. Here we report on the molecular and clinical study of 76 cases from 55 families with either a GLI3 mutation (49 GCPS and 21 PHS), or a large deletion encompassing the GLI3 gene (6 GCPS cases). Most of mutations are novel and consistent with the previously reported genotype-phenotype correlation. Our results also show a correlation between the location of the mutation and abnormal corpus callosum observed in some patients with GCPS. Fetal PHS observations emphasize on the possible lethality of GLI3 mutations and extend the phenotypic spectrum of malformations such as agnathia and reductional limbs defects. GLI3 expression studied by in situ hybridization during human development confirms its early expression in target tissues.",journal article; case reports; case-report
15782417,Significance of bifid epiglottis.,"Bifid epiglottis is a rare anomaly, which is heterogeneous and is often associated with other anomalies, particularly polydactyly. It has been reported in 40% of patients with Pallister-Hall syndrome and rarely in other syndromes. We report two brothers with bifid epiglottis who also have features suggestive of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. We also review the features seen in 22 patients reported in the literature with bifid epiglottis. No patient had bifid epiglottis as an isolated anomaly. Other malformations include clefts, micropenis, renal abnormalities, anal malformations, hypospadias, hypothalamic hamartomas, hypopituitarism, heart defects, and Hirschprung disease. Bifid epiglottis may be an under-recognized feature of Bardet-Biedl syndrome and should be considered in these patients, particularly if there are airway symptoms. Many of the anomalies associated with bifid epiglottis have potentially serious consequences and thus, a thorough evaluation of the patient with bifid epiglottis is warranted.",review; journal article; case reports
17881745,STAT3 mutations in the hyper-IgE syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: The hyper-IgE syndrome (or Job's syndrome) is a rare disorder of immunity and connective tissue characterized by dermatitis, boils, cyst-forming pneumonias, elevated serum IgE levels, retained primary dentition, and bone abnormalities. Inheritance is autosomal dominant; sporadic cases are also found. METHODS: We collected longitudinal clinical data on patients with the hyper-IgE syndrome and their families and assayed the levels of cytokines secreted by stimulated leukocytes and the gene expression in resting and stimulated cells. These data implicated the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 gene (STAT3) as a candidate gene, which we then sequenced. RESULTS: We found increased levels of proinflammatory gene transcripts in unstimulated peripheral-blood neutrophils and mononuclear cells from patients with the hyper-IgE syndrome, as compared with levels in control cells. In vitro cultures of mononuclear cells from patients that were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, with or without interferon-gamma, had higher tumor necrosis factor alpha levels than did identically treated cells from unaffected persons (P=0.003). In contrast, the cells from patients with the hyper-IgE syndrome generated lower levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 in response to the presence of interleukin-6 (P=0.03), suggesting a defect in interleukin-6 signaling through its downstream mediators, one of which is STAT3. We identified missense mutations and single-codon in-frame deletions in STAT3 in 50 familial and sporadic cases of the hyper-IgE syndrome. Eighteen discrete mutations, five of which were hot spots, were predicted to directly affect the DNA-binding and SRC homology 2 (SH2) domains. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in STAT3 underlie sporadic and dominant forms of the hyper-IgE syndrome, an immunodeficiency syndrome involving increased innate immune response, recurrent infections, and complex somatic features.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
18978467,Hyper IgE syndrome: an update on clinical aspects and the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hyper IgE syndrome (HIES) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by eczema, recurrent skin and lung infections, elevated serum IgE, and connective tissue and skeletal abnormalities. We present newly recognized aspects of the clinical phenotype and discuss recent genetic and immunologic findings. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2007, mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were determined to be the cause of autosomal-dominant HIES. Mutations lead to disruption of STAT3-dependent pathways, which are crucial for signaling of many cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-10. On the one hand, cells from STAT3-defective patients have a proinflammatory profile with elevated TNFalpha and IFNgamma; on the other hand, STAT3 mutations result in the inability to produce IL-17 or form Th17 cells. SUMMARY: HIES was previously defined on the basis of clinical manifestations and laboratory markers that were not specific to the disease. With the identification of STAT3 mutations as the cause of HIES, we can definitively characterize the disease at molecular and immunologic levels. Future study of HIES and STAT3 will help us understand eczema, IgE regulation, infection susceptibility, coronary artery disease, scoliosis, and bronchiectasis as well as provide mechanistic insights into treatment.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
22441639,Cutaneous manifestations of Hyper IgE syndrome.,"Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by atopic manifestations and susceptibility to infections with extracellular bacteria and fungi. Atopic manifestations include atopic dermatitis-like skin lesion and extremely high serum IgE levels. Most of the extracellular bacterial infections are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which is associated with milder inflammation compared to normal. Recent studies have revealed that the most cases of the HIES are caused by dominant negative mutations in STAT3 gene. Cutaneous manifestations of HIES includes newborn rash, eczematoid dermatitis, cold abscesses, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and coarse texture of the facial skin. Impaired Th17 cell development due to the defective IL-6 signaling in T cells and impaired induced regulatory T (iTreg) cell generation due to defective IL-10 signaling in dendritic cells may, at least in part, account for the cutaneous pathology of HIES.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
11471164,SHH mutation is associated with solitary median maxillary central incisor: a study of 13 patients and review of the literature.,"Solitary median maxillary central incisor (SMMCI) or single central incisor is a rare dental anomaly. It has been reported in holoprosencephaly (HPE) cases with severe facial anomalies or as a microform in autosomal dominant HPE (ADHPE). In our review of the literature, we note that SMMCI may also occur as an isolated finding or in association with other systemic abnormalities. These anomalies include short stature, pituitary insufficiency, microcephaly, choanal atresia, midnasal stenosis, and congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis. SMMCI can also be a feature of recognized syndromes or associations or a finding in patients with specific chromosomal abnormalities. We performed a molecular study on a cohort of 13 SMMCI patients who did not have HPE. We studied two genes, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and SIX3, in which mutations have been reported in patients showing SMMCI as part of the HPE spectrum. A new missense mutation in SHH (I111F), segregating in one SMMCI family, was identified. Our results suggest that this mutation may be specific for the SMMCI phenotype since it has not been found in the HPE population or in normal controls.

12503095,Novel mutation in sonic hedgehog in non-syndromic colobomatous microphthalmia.,"Ocular (uveoretinal) colobomas occur in one in 10,000 individuals and present a substantive cause of congenital poor vision. The genetic bases of most forms of uveoretinal coloboma are elusive; mutations in PAX2 are found in only a few cases of coloboma of the retina and optic nerve that occur with renal anomalies as part of the renal-coloboma syndrome (MIM#120330; #167409). From experimental data that upstream expression of sonic hedgehog (SHH) controls Pax2 expression in mice and zebrafish, and from clinical experience that colobomas are observed frequently in patients with holoprosencephaly, we hypothesized that SHH could be a candidate for non-syndromic ocular colobomas (NSOC). We identified a three-generation family in which both a proband and his mother presented with iris and uveoretinal colobomas without optic nerve involvement. A novel 24 bp deletion in the gene SHH was identified in these affected family members, and cosegregated with the phenotype. This is the first report of the association of SHH mutations and uveoretinal coloboma.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

18983665,Quantitative Real-Time PCR detection of TRPV1-4 gene expression in human leukocytes from healthy and hyposensitive subjects.,"BACKGROUND: Besides functioning as chemosensors for a broad range of endogenous and synthetic ligands, transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) 1-4 channels have also been related to capsaicin (TRPV1), pain, and thermal stimuli perception, and itching sensation (TRPV1-4). While the expression of the TRPV1-4 genes has been adequately proved in skin, sensory fibres and keratinocytes, less is known about TRPV3 and TRPV4 expression in human blood cells. RESULTS: To study the gene expression of TRPV1-4 genes in human leukocytes, a quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) method, based on the calculation of their relative expression, has been developed and validated. The four commonly used house-keeping genes (HKGs), beta-Actin (Act-B), glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hypoxanthine ribosyltransferase (HPRT1), and cyclophilin B (hCyPB), were tested for the stability of their expression in several human leukocyte samples, and used in the normalization procedure to determine the mRNA levels of the TRPV 1-4 genes in 30 healthy subjects. cDNAs belonging to all the TRPV1-4 genes were detected in leukocytes but the genes appear to be expressed at different levels. Our analysis did not show significant sex differences in TRPV1-4 cDNA levels in the 30 healthy subjects. The same qRT-PCR assay was used to compare TRPV1-4 expression between healthy controls and patients hyposensitive to capsaicin, pain and thermal stimuli: an almost doubled up-regulation of the TRPV1 gene was found in the pathological subjects. CONCLUSION: The qRT-PCR assay developed and tested in this study allowed us to determine the relative expression of TRPV1-4 genes in human leukocytes: TRPV3 is the least expressed gene of this pool, followed by TRPV4, TRPV1 and TRPV2. The comparison of TRPV1-4 gene expression between two groups of healthy and hyposensitive subjects highlighted the evident up-regulation of TRPV1, which was almost doubly expressed (1.9x normalized fold induction) in the latter group. All the four house-keeping genes tested in this work (Act-B, GAPDH, hCyPB, HPRT1) were classified as optimal controls and showed a constant expression in human leukocytes samples. We recommend the use of these genes in similar qRT-PCR studies on human blood cells.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
23064416,Haploinsufficiency for AAGAB causes clinically heterogeneous forms of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma.,"Palmoplantar keratodermas (PPKs) are a group of disorders that are diagnostically and therapeutically problematic in dermatogenetics. Punctate PPKs are characterized by circumscribed hyperkeratotic lesions on the palms and soles with considerable heterogeneity. In 18 families with autosomal dominant punctate PPK, we report heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in AAGAB, encoding α- and γ-adaptin-binding protein p34, located at a previously linked locus at 15q22. α- and γ-adaptin-binding protein p34, a cytosolic protein with a Rab-like GTPase domain, was shown to bind both clathrin adaptor protein complexes, indicating a role in membrane trafficking. Ultrastructurally, lesional epidermis showed abnormalities in intracellular vesicle biology. Immunohistochemistry showed hyperproliferation within the punctate lesions. Knockdown of AAGAB in keratinocytes led to increased cell division, which was linked to greatly elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation. We hypothesize that p34 deficiency may impair endocytic recycling of growth factor receptors such as EGFR, leading to increased signaling and cellular proliferation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
14684683,Identification of a locus for type I punctate palmoplantar keratoderma on chromosome 15q22-q24.,"BACKGROUND:The identification of the molecular basis of disorders of keratinisation has significantly advanced our understanding of skin biology, revealing new information on key structures in the skin, such as the intermediate filaments, desmosomes, and gap junctions. Among these disorders, there is an extraordinarily heterogeneous group known as palmoplantar keratodermas (PPK), for which only a few molecular defects have been described. A particular form of PPK, known as punctate PPK, has been described in a few large autosomal dominant pedigrees, but its genetic basis has yet to be identified. AIM:Identification of the gene for punctate PPK. METHODS:Clinical examination and linkage analysis in three families with punctate PPK. RESULTS:A genomewide scan was performed on an extended autosomal dominant pedigree, and linkage to chromosome 15q22-q24 was identified. With the addition of two new families with the same phenotype, we confirmed the mapping of the locus for punctate PPK to a 9.98 cM interval, flanked by markers D15S534 and D15S818 (maximum two point lod score of 4.93 at theta = 0 for marker D15S988). CONCLUSIONS:We report the clinical and genetic findings in three pedigrees with the punctate form of PPK. We have mapped a genetic locus for this phenotype to chromosome 15q22-q24, which indicates the identification of a new gene involved in skin integrity.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
8447316,Mutations in the paired domain of the human PAX3 gene cause Klein-Waardenburg syndrome (WS-III) as well as Waardenburg syndrome type I (WS-I).,"Waardenburg syndrome type I (WS-I) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, dystopia canthorum, pigmentary disturbances, and other developmental defects. Klein-Waardenburg syndrome (WS-III) is a disorder with many of the same characteristics as WS-I and includes musculoskeletal abnormalities. We have recently reported the identification and characterization of one of the first gene defects, in the human PAX3 gene, which causes WS-I. PAX3 is a DNA-binding protein that contains a structural motif known as the paired domain and is believed to regulate the expression of other genes. In this report we describe two new mutations, in the human PAX3 gene, that are associated with WS. One mutation was found in a family with WS-I, while the other mutation was found in a family with WS-III. Both mutations were in the highly conserved paired domain of the human PAX3 gene and are similar to other mutations that cause WS. The results indicate that mutations in the PAX3 gene can cause both WS-I and WS-III.","comparative study; research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research-article; journal article"

Each exhibited 2 mm of left upper lid elevation on adduction and 4 to 6 mm of lid elevation on adduction with depression. In one of the sisters, 1 mm of ptosis was present in straight ahead gaze in the involved eye, which increased to almost 2 mm on abduction, but full levator function was observed. Four other family members in three consecutive generations were similarly affected, suggesting an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance.

28450900,Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 levels are increased and partially related to body fat distribution in patients with familial partial lipodystrophy type 2.,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP4) is an enzyme responsible for glucagon-like peptide-1 inactivation and plays an important role in glucose metabolism.The aim of this study was to evaluate DPP4 levels in patients with familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2) and correlate it with body fat distribution.Fourteen patients with FPLD2 were selected to participate in this study and matched to a healthy control group (n = 8). All participants had anthropometrical data registered. Body adiposity index (BAI) was used to evaluate fat distribution in this population. Body fat content and distribution were analyzed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Biochemical exams, including DPP4 levels, were performed in all individuals.Despite the same body mass index, lipodystrophic patients had a significant lower hip (median 92.0 vs 94.5; p = 0.028), HDL cholesterol (42.6 ± 10.4 vs 66.1 ± 16.0; p < 0.01) and BAI (24.1 ± 2.8 vs 29.0 ± 3.7; p = 0.02), suggesting that BAI was able to catch differences in fat distribution between groups. On the other hand, patients with FPLD2 presented significant higher levels of insulin (median 11.2 vs 5.3; p = 0.015), triglycerides (184.9 ± 75.4 vs 89.1 ± 51.0; p < 0.01) and DPP4 (4.89 ± 0.92 vs 3.93 ± 1.08; p = 0.04). A trend toward an inverse statistical significance was observed between DPP4 levels and BAI (r = -0.38; p = 0.072). In the lipodistrophic group, a significant correlation was found between DPP4 levels and percentage of total body fat (r = 0.86; p = 0.0025) and android fat (r = 0.78; p = 0.014).Patients with FPLD2 exhibit an increase in DDP4 levels in comparison to a healthy control group. The increase in the levels of this enzyme does not seem to be related to the diagnosis of diabetes and might be associated with an increase in central fat (estimated using BAI and measured using DXA). These results might be used to reinforce the concept that DDP4 is an adipokine related to central fat distribution.",research-article; journal article

This is a review of the condition based on the clinical findings in 71 subjects from 10 families. All 71 individuals have a mutation in VEGFR-3. Ninety per cent of the 71 individuals carrying a VEGFR-3 mutation showed signs of oedema, which was confined in all cases to the lower limbs. In all but two cases onset of swelling was from birth. Other symptoms and signs included cellulitis (20%), large calibre leg veins (23%), papillomatosis (10%), and upslanting toenails (10%). In males, hydrocoele was the next most common finding after oedema (37%). Thorough clinical examination of these patients indicates that there are few clinical signs in addition to lower limb oedema. Rigorous phenotyping of patients produces a high yield of VEGFR-3 mutations.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
16965327,Hereditary lymphedema type I associated with VEGFR3 mutation: the first de novo case and atypical presentations.,"Mutations in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 gene, VEGFR3/FLT4, have been identified in a subset of families with hereditary lymphedema type I or Milroy disease (MIM 153100). Individuals carrying a VEGFR3 mutation exhibit congenital edema of the lower limbs, usually bilaterally and below the knees, sometimes associated with cellulitis, prominent veins, papillomatosis, upturned toenails, and hydrocele. In this study, we report the first de novo VEGFR3 mutation in a patient with sporadic congenital lymphedema. We also describe three other families with a VEGFR3 mutation. In each family, one individual had an atypical clinical presentation of hereditary lymphedema type I, whereas the others had the classical VEGFR3 mutation-caused phenotype. The atypical presentations included pre-natal pleural effusion, spontaneous resorption of lymphedema and elephantiasis. Three of the four identified mutations were novel. These data show that de novo VEGFR3 mutations may be present in patients without family history of congenital lymphedema. This has implications for follow-up care, as such individuals have nearly a 50% risk for occurrence of lymphedema in their children. Our findings also indicate that although most patients with a VEGFR3 mutation have the well-defined phenotype for hereditary lymphedema type I, there are exceptions that should be considered in genetic counseling. Because VEGFR3 mutation can cause generalized lymphatic dysfunction and can thus result in hydrops fetalis, VEGFR3 screening should be added to the investigation of cases of hydrops fetalis of an unknown etiology.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

Here, 167 unrelated AMD patients were screened for alterations in ABCR, a gene that encodes a retinal rod photoreceptor protein and is defective in Stargardt disease, a common hereditary form of macular dystrophy. Thirteen different AMD-associated alterations, both deletions and amino acid substitutions, were found in one allele of ABCR in 26 patients (16%).

Phenotype-genotype correlations were investigated for 19 clinical features, between TCOF1 and POLR1D, and the type of mutation or its localization in the TCOF1 gene.We identified 92/146 patients (63%) with a molecular anomaly within TCOF1, 9/146 (6%) within POLR1D, and none within POLR1C. Among the atypical negative patients (with intellectual disability and/or microcephaly), we identified four patients carrying a mutation in EFTUD2 and two patients with 5q32 deletion encompassing TCOF1 and CAMK2A in particular. Congenital cardiac defects occurred more frequently among patients with TCOF1 mutation (7/92, 8%) than reported in the literature.Even though TCOF1 and POLR1D were associated with extreme clinical variability, we found no phenotype-genotype correlation. In cases with a typical phenotype of TCS, 6/146 (4%) remained with an unidentified molecular defect.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Of 573 patients, exotropia occurred in 67 (11.7%), esotropia in 12 (2.1%), vertical deviations in eight (1.4%), and primary inferior oblique muscle overaction in three (0.5%). Of 67 patients with exotropia, 18 had anisometropia and 39 had amblyopia. Of the 12 patients with esotropia, four had amblyopia and none had anisometropia. Exotropia and esotropia are more common in patients with the Marfan syndrome than in the general population of the United States (P < .001 for exotropia and .05 < P < .10 for esotropia). Abnormal afferent visual inputs to cortical centers caused by ectopia lentis, craniofacial abnormalities, and mechanical and genetic factors may all contribute to the higher prevalence of strabismus in this disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
26339165,Analysis of Protrusio Acetabuli Using a CT-based Diagnostic Method in Korean Patients with Marfan Syndrome: Prevalence and Association with Other Manifestations.,"A new CT-based diagnostic method of protrusio acetabuli (PA) was introduced. However, prevalence of PA by this method and correlation between PA and other manifestations of Marfan syndrome (MFS) is unknown in Korean MFS patients. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of PA diagnosed by a CT-based method in Korean patients with MFS, the association of PA with other manifestations of MFS, and the contribution of PA to MFS diagnosis. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 146 MFS patients with the presence of a causative FBN1 mutation and 146 age- and sex-matched controls from a single tertiary care center. All MFS patients underwent a complete assessment of criteria based on the revised Ghent nosology. PA was assessed quantitatively using a CT-based circle-wall distance (CWD) method. PA was diagnosed in 77.4% of patients in the MFS group and in 11.0% of the control group. CWD was significantly different between the two groups (1.50 mm vs. -0.64 mm, P<0.001). The presence of PA did not correlate with the presence of ectopia lentis, aortic root diameter, or history of aortic dissection. The presence of PA did not have a significant impact on the final diagnosis of MFS. Even though the presence of PA does not related to the cardinal clinical features of MFS or influence MFS diagnosis, its presence may be helpful for the suspicion of MFS when aortic dissection or aneurysm is found on CT angiography of the aorta because of the high frequency of PA in MFS patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
8530937,Spontaneous intracranial hypotension from a CSF leak in a patient with Marfan's syndrome.,"A patient with Marfan's syndrome had spontaneous intracranial hypotension secondary to a proved CSF leak. It is postulated that the leak was caused by minor, unrecognised trauma rupturing spinal arachnoid diverticula. The diverticula were probably pre-existing abnormalities complicating the Marfan's syndrome. It is concluded that patients with spinal meningeal defects may be at increased risk of developing CSF leaks, possibly secondary to unrecognised trauma.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
10489951,Importance of dural ectasia in phenotypic assessment of Marfan's syndrome.,"BACKGROUND:Early identification of Marfan's syndrome is fundamental in the prevention of aortic dilatation, but the wide phenotypic expression of the disorder makes the clinical diagnosis very difficult. Dural ectasia has been classified as a major diagnostic criterion; however, its prevalence is not known. We aimed to identify the true prevalence of dural ectasia in Marfan's syndrome, and to investigate its relation to aortic pathology. METHODS:A magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) study of the thoracic aorta and of the lumbosacral spine was done in an inclusive series of 83 patients with Marfan's syndrome to assess the presence and degree of dural ectasia and aortic involvement; 12 patients were younger than 18 years. 100 individuals who underwent MRI of the lumbar spine for routine clinical indications represented the control group; none of them had any potential causes for dural ectasia. FINDINGS:Dural ectasia was identified in 76 (92%) patients and none of the control group. The severity of dural ectasia was related to age; the mean (SD) age of patients with mild dural ectasia was 26 years (14) whereas that of those with severe disease (meningocele) was 36 years (9) (p=0.038). 11 of 12 patients younger than 18 years had dural ectasia. No association was found between aortic dilatation and dural ectasia. INTERPRETATION:Dural ectasia is a highly characteristic sign of Marfan's syndrome, even at an early age.",journal article

A clinical approach to the differentiation of this numerically important group from the various other causes of large head is outlined. The group is characterised by a familial incidence of large head in at least 50 per cent of cases; a male to female preponderance of four to one; an above-normal rate of head growth in 80 per cent of the children in the first four months after birth, and in a further 12 per cent in late infancy. The vast majority of these children were normal. Only seven children were retarded, and they also had a variety of neurological and other somatic abnormalities.",discussion; journal article
4073120,Thanatophoric dysplasia: fetal manifestations and prenatal diagnosis.,"This paper describes two fetuses with thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) diagnosed in utero by ultrasonography. The fetuses were found to have severely short (less than 3rd centile), mildly bowed bones in one of them at 20 weeks and straight bones in the other at 34 weeks; bell-shaped chest; abnormal ribs (broadened and flattened at their ends); severe lung hypoplasia; hypoplastic, round-shaped vertebral bodies with hypoplastic arches; abnormally small pelvic bones, phalanges, metacarpals, and metatarsals. There was also an incipient ""cloverleaf"" skull deformity produced by fused posterior sagittal and lambdoidal sutures in the 20-week fetus and a definitive cloverleaf skull with communicating hydrocephaly in the 34-week fetus. The autopsies did not show any other abnormality. By xeroradiography after delivery, marked abnormalities of the endochondral and perichondral bone structures could be demonstrated in the 20-week fetus but not in the 34-week fetus. They appear to constitute two different conditions. These cases are good examples of the possibilities brought by ultrasound to the analysis of the fetal phenotype in utero.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
22497611,Malformations of cortical development.,"Structural abnormalities of the brain are increasingly recognized in patients that suffer from pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies by applying high-resolution imaging techniques. In many of these patients, epilepsy surgery results in control of seizures. Neuropathologically, a broad spectrum of malformations of cortical development (MCD) is observed in respective surgical brain samples. These samples provide a unique basis to further understand underlying pathomechanisms by molecular approaches and develop improved diagnostics and entirely new therapeutic perspectives. Here we provide a comprehensive description of neuropathological findings, available classification systems as well as molecular mechanisms of MCDs. We emphasize the recently published ILEA classification system for focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), which are now histopathologically distinguished as types I to III. However, this revised classification system represents a major challenge for molecular neuropathologists, as the underlying pathomechanisms in virtually all FCD entities will need to be specified in detail. The fact that only recently, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-antagonist Everolimus has been introduced as a treatment of epilepsies in the context of tuberous sclerosis-associated brain lesions is a striking example of a successful translational ""bedside to bench and back"" approach. Hopefully, the exciting clinico-pathological developments in the field of MCDs will in short term foster further therapeutic breakthroughs for the frequently associated medically refractory epilepsies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
20975055,Clinical features of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy 2.,"In some 5% of patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), no D4Z4 repeat contraction on chromosome 4q35 is observed. Such patients, termed patients with FSHD2, show loss of DNA methylation and heterochromatin markers at the D4Z4 repeat that are similar to patients with D4Z4 contractions (FSHD1). This commonality suggests that a change in D4Z4 chromatin structure unifies FSHD1 and FSHD2. The aim of our study was to critically evaluate the clinical features in patients with FSHD2 in order to establish whether these patients are phenotypically identical to FSHD1 and to establish the effects of the (epi-) genotype on the phenotype.This cross-sectional study studied 33 patients with FSHD2 from 27 families, the largest cohort described to date. All patients were clinically assessed using a standardized clinical evaluation form. Genotype analysis was performed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and PCR; D4Z4 methylation was studied by methylation-sensitive Southern blot analysis.FSHD2 is identical to FSHD1 in its clinical presentation. Notable differences include a higher incidence (67%) of sporadic cases and the absence of gender differences in disease severity in FSHD2. Overall, average disease severity in FSHD2 was similar to that reported in FSHD1 and was not influenced by D4Z4 repeat size. In FSHD2, a small effect of the degree of hypomethylation on disease severity was observed.Clinically, patients with FSHD2 are indistinguishable from patients with FSHD1. The present data suggest that FSHD1 and FSHD2 are the result of the same pathophysiologic process.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
8328457,Evidence for heterogeneity in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a slowly progressive primary disease of muscle which is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder. FSHD has been localized to the long arm of chromosome 4, specifically to the 4q3.5-qter region. Initially published linkage studies showed no evidence for heterogeneity in FSHD. In the present study we have examined individuals in seven FSHD families. Two-point lod scores show significant evidence for linkage for D4S163 (lod score 3.04 at recombination fraction .21) and D4S139 (lod score 3.84 at recombination fraction .20). D4S171 also gave a positive score (lod score 2.56 at recombination fraction .24). Significant evidence for heterogeneity was found for each of the three markers. Multipoint linkage analysis in this region resulted in a peak multipoint lod score of 6.47. The multipoint analysis supported the two-point studies with odds of 20:1 showing linkage and heterogeneity over linkage and homogeneity. Five of the seven families gave a posterior probability of > 95% of being of the linked type, while two families appeared unlinked to this region of 4q (P < .01%). Individuals in the two unlinked families met the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of FSHD, including facial weakness, clavicular flattening, scapula winging, proximal muscle weakness, and myopathic changes on muscle biopsies without inflammatory or mitochondrial pathology. This study demonstrates genetic heterogeneity in FSHD and has important implications for both genetic counseling and the elucidation of the etiology of FSHD.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
27259050,Ataxia-Pancytopenia Syndrome Is Caused by Missense Mutations in SAMD9L.,"Ataxia-pancytopenia (AP) syndrome is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, variable hematologic cytopenias, and predisposition to marrow failure and myeloid leukemia, sometimes associated with monosomy 7. Here, in the four-generation family UW-AP, linkage analysis revealed four regions that provided the maximal LOD scores possible, one of which was in a commonly microdeleted chromosome 7q region. Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation (c.2640C>A, p.His880Gln) in the sterile alpha motif domain containing 9-like gene (SAMD9L) that completely cosegregated with disease. By targeted sequencing of SAMD9L, we subsequently identified a different missense mutation (c.3587G>C, p.Cys1196Ser) in affected members of the first described family with AP syndrome, Li-AP. Neither variant is reported in the public databases, both affect highly conserved amino acid residues, and both are predicted to be damaging. With time in culture, lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs) from two affected individuals in family UW-AP exhibited copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity for large portions of the long arm of chromosome 7, resulting in retention of only the wild-type SAMD9L allele. Newly established LCLs from both individuals demonstrated the same phenomenon. In addition, targeted capture and sequencing of SAMD9L in uncultured blood DNA from both individuals showed bias toward the wild-type allele. These observations indicate inÂ vivo hematopoietic mosaicism. The hematopoietic cytopenias that characterize AP syndrome and the selective advantage for clones that have lost the mutant allele support the postulated role of SAMD9L in the regulation of cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show that AP syndrome is distinct from the dyskeratoses congenita telomeropathies, with which it shares some clinical characteristics.",research-article; journal article
22396310,"Mutation spectrum in the large GTPase dynamin 2, and genotype-phenotype correlation in autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy.","Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with general skeletal muscle weakness, type I fiber predominance and atrophy, and abnormally centralized nuclei. Autosomal dominant CNM is due to mutations in the large GTPase dynamin 2 (DNM2), a mechanochemical enzyme regulating cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking in cells. To date, 40 families with CNM-related DNM2 mutations have been described, and here we report 60 additional families encompassing a broad genotypic and phenotypic spectrum. In total, 18 different mutations are reported in 100 families and our cohort harbors nine known and four new mutations, including the first splice-site mutation. Genotype-phenotype correlation hypotheses are drawn from the published and new data, and allow an efficient screening strategy for molecular diagnosis. In addition to CNM, dissimilar DNM2 mutations are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) peripheral neuropathy (CMTD1B and CMT2M), suggesting a tissue-specific impact of the mutations. In this study, we discuss the possible clinical overlap of CNM and CMT, and the biological significance of the respective mutations based on the known functions of dynamin 2 and its protein structure. Defects in membrane trafficking due to DNM2 mutations potentially represent a common pathological mechanism in CNM and CMT.",research-article; journal article

Fifty subjects were recruited and submitted to a complete clinical, electrophysiologic and genetic evaluation. Thirteen mutations were identified in CLCN1 and five mutations were identified in SCN4A. Onset in the lower extremities, presence of tongue myotonia and transient weakness suggested recessive CLCN1 mutations. Lid myotonia, absence of hypertrophy and exacerbation with cold temperature suggested SCN4A mutations. Pain was not a feature of dominant CLCN1 mutations while it could be seen in the others, more frequently in SCN4A mutations. Warm up phenomenon, hand grip myotonia, percussion myotonia, lid lag and hormonal effects were not distinguishing features. Repetitive nerve stimulation and short exercise test showed either a large (>50%) or mild-moderate (10-50%) decrement with recessive CLCN1 mutations while they showed only mild or no decrement with dominant CLCN1 and SCN4A mutations.

12624132,Nail patella syndrome: a review of the phenotype aided by developmental biology.,"Nail patella syndrome (NPS) is an autosomal dominant condition affecting the nails, skeletal system, kidneys, and eyes. Skeletal features include absent or hypoplastic patellae, patella dislocations, elbow abnormalities, talipes, and iliac horns on x ray. Kidney involvement may lead to renal failure and there is also a risk of glaucoma. There is marked inter- and intrafamilial variability. The results of a British study involving 123 NPS patients are compared with previously published studies and it is suggested that neurological and vasomotor symptoms are also part of the NPS phenotype. In addition, the first data on the incidence of glaucoma and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in NPS are presented. NPS is caused by loss of function mutations in the transcription factor LMX1B at 9q34. The expansion of the clinical phenotype is supported by the role of LMX1B during development.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; journal article"
10668560,The relationship between the tibialis posterior tendon and the accessory navicular.,"Out of a total of 116 cadaver feet, 29 specimens were selected by means of palpation of the tuberosity of navicular for a possible presence of the accessory navicular. They were then radiographed and the accessory navicular was detected in ten. Also three fresh amputation specimens with an accessory navicular were added to the study. A total of 13 legs was dissected and in nine of them, the tibialis posterior tendon inserted directly into the accessory navicular without extending to the sole of the foot. In these feet, the second part of the tibialis posterior tendon originated from the accessory navicular, extending to the normal insertions. There was no connection between these two parts and when traction was applied to either one, no movement was observed in the other. Also a fibrocartilaginous mass was detected in four specimens, probably formed to resist the friction between the tendon and the bone. These results may explain the pronated foot in the presence of the navicular, due to the loss of the function of the tibialis posterior tendon.",journal article

12151887,Orthopaedic manifestations of neurofibromatosis in children: an update.,"Neurofibromatosis is one of the most common genetic disorders affecting mankind. Despite extensive basic science research, the diagnosis still is based largely on well-defined clinical criteria, which often present gradually during childhood. Approximately 50% of patients have significant musculoskeletal manifestations, with scoliosis and congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia most common. Approximately 20% of children with Type I neurofibromatosis present with scoliosis with or without the classic dystrophic features, such as vertebral scalloping and rib penciling. Dystrophic curves portend rapid progression and require early fusion. Surgical treatment often is challenging because of the common presence of neurofibromas adjacent to the spinal cord, significant multiplanar deformity, and poor bone quality. Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia also continues to present significant difficulties. The use of a brace is the mainstay of early treatment, whereas intramedullary rodding commonly is used for operative fixation. Grafting of the free fibula and correction using techniques of distraction and compression histiogenesis with Ilizarov fixators have been reported for refractory cases with varying degrees of success. Multiple heroic, operative attempts may have a tremendous toll on the quality of life of affected children through their early childhood. In addition to these and other distinctive musculoskeletal lesions, affected children often suffer from various medical problems.",journal article

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective case series of patients with NF1 and angle closure due to iris neovascularization secondary to retinal vascular abnormalities. Histopathologic analysis of an enucleated eye in 1 case. RESULTS: Three children whose age ranged from 5 to 10 years at presentation, developed unilateral retinal vascular abnormalities that resulted in iris neovascularization and angle closure with a wide range of intraocular pressures. Two patients had retinal vasoproliferative lesions of which the affected eye became blind in 1 patient and the other retained useful vision after treatment with intracameral Bevacizumab, ablation of the retinal lesions, and surgical treatment of the neovascular glaucoma. The third patient underwent enucleation and had pathologic evidence of retinal ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of retinal vascular lesions occurring in NF1 are capable of producing iris neovascularization, ectropion uvea, and neovascular glaucoma. Although a spectrum of serious complications resulting in total vision loss can occur, retention of useful vision is possible, in some cases, with aggressive treatment of the retinal lesions and associated neovascular glaucoma. This report highlights the need for careful examination of the posterior segment with special attention to peripheral retinal vascular abnormalities or tumors in young patients with NF1.",journal article; case reports
29618358,Clinical and molecular characterization of 112 single-center patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1.,"BACKGROUND:The aim of this retrospective study was to define clinical and molecular characteristics of a large sample of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, as well as to evaluate mutational spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation. NF1 is a relatively common neurogenetic disorder (1:2500-1:3000 individuals). It is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene on chromosome 17ql1.2, with autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and wide phenotypical variability. Café-au-lait spots (CALs), cutaneous and/or subcutaneous neurofibromas (CNFs/SCNFs), skinfold freckling, skeletal abnormalities, Lisch nodules of the iris and increased risk of learning and intellectual disabilities, as well as tumors of the nervous system and other organs are its main clinical features. METHODS:The preliminary group collected 168 subjects with clinical suspicion of NF1. They were evaluated following the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria for NF1, revised by Gutmann et al. 1997, integrated for 67 of them by molecular testing. According to these references, 112 of 168 patients were diagnosed as NF1. The sample was characterized by an equal sex ratio (57 males, 55 females) and age distribution ranging from 10 days to 60 years of age (mean age, 13 years). RESULTS:A wide spectrum of clinical features has been observed in our patients. Mutational analysis resulted positive in 51 cases (76%). Twenty-four mutations detected in our cohort have not been reported to date. CONCLUSIONS:This study may contribute to a better definition of genotypic and phenotypic features of NF1 patients, with respect to further insights into the clinical characterization of the disease. In addition, an amplification of the spectrum of mutations in the NF1 gene has been documented.",research-article; multicenter study; journal article
29566708,Seizures in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: is neurofibromatosis type 1 enough?,"BACKGROUND:Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is related to a generally increased prevalence of seizures. The mechanism underlying the increased predisposition to seizures has not been fully elucidated. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of NF1 in seizures pathogenesis in a cohort of children with NF1 and seizures. METHODS:The medical records of 437 children (0-18 years old) with NF1 were reviewed. All children with at least one afebrile seizure were included. Demographic, clinical, neurological, NF1 mutation status, and EEG data were collected along with brain magnetic resonance imaging. Depending on etiology, structural seizures have been identified and were further classified as NF1 related or not. RESULTS:Nineteen patients (4.3%; 13 males) were included. NF1 was inherited in 7 (37.5%), with 3 maternal forms. Ten children with structural seizures were identified. Seven forms were identified someway related to NF1, two of which were associated to 17q11.2 microdeletion and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Any brain lesion that could explain seizures was found in nine patients, two third of these patients had a familiar history of epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest seizures are more frequent in NF1 children (4.3%) than in general pediatric population (0.3-0.5%) and that are someway related to NF1 in half of patients. Facing seizures in NF1, the clinician should first exclude brain tumors but also other, and rarer NF1-related scenarios, such as hydrocephalous and vasculopathies. Children with non-structural seizures frequently had a family history of epilepsy, raising questions about the pathogenic role of NF1. They should be approached as for the general population.",research-article; journal article
18802710,Neurofibromatosis type 1 and infantile spasms.,"There is no agreement on the prevalence, natural history and outcome of infantile spasms (IS) in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). By contrast, its prevalence and outcome are well characterised in the setting of other neurocutaneous disorders (e.g. tuberous sclerosis).The aim of the present study was to try to establish a genotype-phenotype correlation in IS in the setting of NF1. A retrospective (years 1990-2000) and prospective (years 2000-2006) study in three paediatric centres in Italy were taken as referral populations for: (1) children with NF1 and (2) neurological problems in childhood.Ten NF1 patients have had IS. The calculated population-based: (1) prevalence of IS in NF1 (0.76%) was higher than the reported frequency of IS in the general population (0.02-0.05%) and (2) frequency of NF1 in the IS series in two out of three centres (0.62-0.90%) was lower than the estimated frequencies in the literature (1.5-3.0%). Patients had psychomotor delay preceding the spasms (50%), symmetrical spasms (50%), typical (80%) and modified (20%) hypsarrhythmia and foci of spikes and waves and a good response to corticosteroid treatment (50%). Outcome was good in 30%. Imaging revealed high-signal foci in atypical locations (sub-cortical and central brain regions). Deoxyribonucleic acid analysis revealed three novel NF1 gene mutations without genotype-phenotype correlation.Even though the combination of IS and NF1 does not seem to be coincidental, it is certainly an unusual event in NF1--rarer than in other neurocutaneous disorders.

METHODS: Two hundred and one NF1 patients underwent whole body MRI (WBMRI). Tumour burden was estimated volumetrically. Non-parametric Spearman's rho correlation coefficients were used to analyse the relationship of growth rate to tumour volume and age. Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for analysing the association of tumour occurrence with sex or age. Chi-squared tests were used to analyse the association of tumour growth with age group. RESULTS: Seventy-one of 171 patients with serial WBMRI exams had internal PNs (median follow up 2.2 years [1.1 to 4.9 years]). Median whole body tumour volume was 86.4 mL [5.2 to 5878.5 mL]) with a median growth rate of 3.7%/year (-13.4 to 111%/year) that correlated with larger whole body tumour volume (P<0.001) and lower age (P=0.004). No new PNs developed in 273.0 patient-years among patients without tumours. Rate of new tumour development among patients with PNs was 0.6%/year (95% confidence interval 0.02 to 3.4%). Twenty-seven (13.5%) tumours increased significantly and were more frequent among children (P<0.001). Growth rate of tumours was inversely correlated with age (Spearman's rho=-0.330, P<0.001). Seventy-one (35.5%) tumours had smaller volumes on follow up (median -3.4%/year [-0.07% to -35.9%/year]). CONCLUSION: Children with NF1 and internal PNs are at risk for tumour growth. Most PNs grow slowly or not at all, and some decrease in size. New tumours are infrequent in NF1 patients with PNs and unlikely in patients without PNs.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Of great interest was the identification of HLA-B12 at the B locus in all affected members but not in the unaffected child. The two children known since infancy to be most severely affected with eczema and recurrent infections are HLA identical and homozygous for HLA-B12. The child without eczema and infections had an intermediate cellular chemotactic defect most apparent on kinetic studies.",research-article; journal article
20805368,"Mosaicism for oncogenic G12D KRAS mutation associated with epidermal nevus, polycystic kidneys and rhabdomyosarcoma.","Epidermal nevus (EN) is a congenital disorder characterised by hyperpigmented epidermal thickening following a Blaschko's line. It is due to somatic mutations in either FGFR3 or PIK3CA in half of the cases, and remains of unknown genetic origin in the other half. EN is also seen as part of complex developmental disorders or in association with bladder carcinomas, also related to FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations. Mosaic mutations of these genes have been occasionally found in syndromic EN.The co-occurrence of EN, rhabdomyosarcoma, polycystic kidneys and growth retardation in an infant is described.An oncogenic G12D KRAS mutation was detected in both the epidermal component of the EN and in the rhabdomyosarcoma but not in the dermal component of the EN lesion or in unaffected tissues, including normal skin or blood.This report shows for the first time that a KRAS mutation in epiderma causes EN. Observation of the same G12D KRAS mutation in two distinct regions of the body strongly suggests a somatic mosaicism. Finally, this report highlights the potentially underestimated importance of mosaic oncogene mutations in childhood cancers.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
15820710,Familial and sporadic subtypes of early-onset Obsessive-Compulsive disorder.,"BACKGROUND: Family studies of Obsessive-Compulsive (OCD) indicate there is substantial heterogeneity in the familiality of the disorder. This study was done to determine whether there are differences between familial and sporadic probands with early-onset OCD in obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom categories and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. METHODS: We ascertained 50 OCD probands ranging in age from 10 to 19 years with an onset of OC symptoms before age 15 years. All probands were directly assessed with semistructured diagnostic interviews; their first-degree and second-degree relatives were directly or indirectly assessed with similar diagnostic instruments. Descriptive data were compared in 33 familial and 17 sporadic OCD probands using logistic regression to control for age, gender, and age at onset of OC symptoms. RESULTS: Ordering compulsions were significantly more common in the familial OCD probands. Aberrant grooming behaviors were significantly more frequent in the familial subgroup with skin picking contributing significantly to that difference. Anxiety disorders other than OCD were also significantly more frequent in the familial subgroup with phobic disorders contributing significantly to that difference. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that familial and sporadic forms of early-onset OCD may be differentiated by ordering compulsions, aberrant grooming behaviors, and anxiety disorders other than OCD.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
9448569,"Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I. Nerve conduction and evoked potential studies in families with SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3.","Forty-one patients suffering from autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I (ADCA-I) were subjected to a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis using molecular genetic assignment to the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2 or 3 (SCA1, -2 or -3) genetic locus, clinical examination and nerve conduction as well as evoked potential studies. Pyramidal tract signs, pale discs, and dysphagia were more frequent in SCA1 compared with SCA2 and SCA3 patients, while double vision occurred less frequently. Visual evoked potentials and motor evoked potentials following transcranial magnetic stimulation were abnormal in almost all SCA1 patients, but only in a minority of SCA2 and SCA3 patients. In contrast, somatosensory evoked potentials were delayed or absent in the majority of patients with no significant differences between the mutations. Abnormalities of brainstem auditory evoked potentials were found in about half of the patients irrespective of the underlying mutation. In addition, reduced sensory nerve action potentials, suggesting sensory axonal neuropathy were found in all three mutations. These findings provide electrophysiological evidence that pyramidal and visual pathways are differentially affected in SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3 patients.",journal article
9781533,Molecular and clinical studies in SCA-7 define a broad clinical spectrum and the infantile phenotype.,"OBJECTIVE:To screen for the SCA-7 mutation in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) families and study genotype/phenotype correlations. BACKGROUND:The association of cerebellar ataxia and progressive pigmentary macular dystrophy clinically defines a distinct form of ADCA classified as SCA-7. SCA-7 is caused by expansion of a highly unstable CAG repeat that lies in the coding region of a novel gene on chromosome 3p12-13. METHODS:We screened 51 ADCA kindreds, in which SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, and SCA6 mutations had been excluded, for the SCA-7 mutation using primers that specifically amplify the SCA-7 CAG repeat. RESULTS:The SCA-7 mutation was identified in 10 independent families. Normal alleles ranged from 7 to 16 repeats; expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 306 repeats. One allele with 36 repeats was found in an asymptomatic individual carrying an at-risk haplotype. SCA-7 presents a wide spectrum of clinical features including visual loss, dementia, hypoacusia, severe hypotonia, and auditory hallucinations. Juvenile SCA-7 occurs on maternal and paternal transmission of the mutation, whereas the infantile form occurs only on paternal transmission. An infant of African American descent carried the largest SCA-7 expansion (306 CAG repeats) and had severe hypotonia, congestive heart failure, patent ductus arteriosus, cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, and visual loss. CONCLUSION:These data show a wide spectrum of phenotypic abnormalities in SCA-7 and define an infantile phenotype caused by the largest CAG repeat expansion described to date.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
25159689,Clinical and molecular genetic findings in autosomal dominant OPA3-related optic neuropathy.,"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and autosomal dominant optic atrophy are the two most common inherited optic neuropathies. The latter has been associated with mutations in the OPA1 and OPA3 genes. To date, only six families with OPA3-associated dominant optic atrophy have been reported. In order to identify additional families, we performed Sanger sequencing of the OPA3 gene in 75 unrelated optic neuropathy patients. Affected individuals from two families were found to harbour the c.313C > G, p.(Gln105Glu) change in heterozygous state; this genetic defect has been previously reported in four dominant optic atrophy families. Intra- and interfamilial variability in age of onset and presenting symptoms was observed. Although dominant OPA3 mutations are typically associated with optic atrophy and cataracts, the former can be observed in isolation; we report a case with no lens opacities at age 38. Conversely, it is important to consider OPA3-related disease in individuals with bilateral infantile-onset cataracts and to assess optic nerve health in those whose vision fail to improve following lens surgery. The papillomacular bundle is primarily affected and vision is typically worse than 20/40. Notably, we describe one subject who retained normal acuities into the fifth decade of life. The condition can be associated with extraocular clinical features: two affected individuals in the present study had sensorineural hearing loss. The clinical heterogeneity observed in the individuals reported here (all having the same genetic defect in OPA3) suggests that the molecular pathology of the disorder is likely to be complex.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20157015,Multi-system neurological disease is common in patients with OPA1 mutations.,"Additional neurological features have recently been described in seven families transmitting pathogenic mutations in OPA1, the most common cause of autosomal dominant optic atrophy. However, the frequency of these syndromal 'dominant optic atrophy plus' variants and the extent of neurological involvement have not been established. In this large multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45 independent families, including 60 new cases, we show that extra-ocular neurological complications are common in OPA1 disease, and affect up to 20% of all mutational carriers. Bilateral sensorineural deafness beginning in late childhood and early adulthood was a prominent manifestation, followed by a combination of ataxia, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy and progressive external ophthalmoplegia from the third decade of life onwards. We also identified novel clinical presentations with spastic paraparesis mimicking hereditary spastic paraplegia, and a multiple sclerosis-like illness. In contrast to initial reports, multi-system neurological disease was associated with all mutational subtypes, although there was an increased risk with missense mutations [odds ratio = 3.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.44-6.49; P = 0.0027], and mutations located within the guanosine triphosphate-ase region (odds ratio = 2.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.08-4.82; P = 0.0271). Histochemical and molecular characterization of skeletal muscle biopsies revealed the presence of cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in the majority of patients harbouring OPA1 mutations, even in those with isolated optic nerve involvement. However, the cytochrome c oxidase-deficient load was over four times higher in the dominant optic atrophy + group compared to the pure optic neuropathy group, implicating a causal role for these secondary mitochondrial DNA defects in disease pathophysiology. Individuals with dominant optic atrophy plus phenotypes also had significantly worse visual outcomes, and careful surveillance is therefore mandatory to optimize the detection and management of neurological disability in a group of patients who already have significant visual impairment.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; multicenter study; journal article"
15210948,Functional variants within the secreted frizzled-related protein 3 gene are associated with hip osteoarthritis in females.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability in Western society with multiple risk factors, including a complex genetic pattern. Identifying loci involved in the heredity of OA might lead to insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this common disorder. A previous genome scan mapped a primary hip OA susceptibility locus to chromosome 2q with a maximum multipoint logarithm of odds score of 1.6 in 378 affected sibling pair families. Here, microsatellite targeting of eight candidate genes in this region from 2q23-2q32 demonstrated significant associations with the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 6 gene in all probands and the integrin alpha 6 and frizzled motif associated with bone development (FRZB) genes in female probands. However, genotyping showed lack of association for a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism in tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 6, whereas a single-nucleotide polymorphism in FRZB resulting in an Arg324Gly substitution at the carboxyl terminus was associated with hip OA in the female probands (P = 0.04). This association was confirmed in an independent cohort of female hip cases (n = 338; P = 0.04). In addition, a haplotype coding for substitutions of two highly conserved arginine residues (Arg200Trp and Arg324Gly) in FRZB was a strong risk factor for primary hip OA, with an odds ratio of 4.1 (P = 0.004). FRZB encodes secreted frizzled-related protein 3, which is a soluble antagonist of wingless (wnt) signaling. Variant secreted frizzled-related protein 3 with the Arg324Gly substitution had diminished ability to antagonize wnt signaling in vitro. Hence, functional polymorphisms within FRZB confer susceptibility for hip OA in females and implicate the wnt signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
19533842,Osteogenesis imperfecta: recent findings shed new light on this once well-understood condition.,"Osteogenesis imperfecta is a systemic heritable disorder of connective tissue whose cardinal manifestation is bone fragility. In approximately 90% of individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta, mutations in either of the genes encoding the pro-alpha1 or pro-alpha2 chains of type I collagen (COL1A1 or COL1A2) can be identified. Of those without collagen mutations, a number of them will have mutations involving the enzyme complex responsible for posttranslational hydroxylation of the position 3 proline residue of COL1A1. Two of the genes encoding proteins involved in that enzyme complex, LEPRE1 and cartilage-associated protein, when mutated have been shown to cause autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta, which has a moderate to severe clinical phenotype, often indistinguishable from osteogenesis imperfecta types II or III. Mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2 which result in an abnormal protein still capable of forming a triple helix cause a more severe phenotype than mutations that lead to decreased collagen production as a result of the dominant negative effect mediated by continuous protein turnover. The current standard of care includes a multidisciplinary approach with surgical intervention when necessary, proactive physiotherapy, and consideration for the use of bisphosphonates all in attempts to improve quality of life.",review; journal article

9618173,A mutation in human keratin K6b produces a phenocopy of the K17 disorder pachyonychia congenita type 2.,"Type I and type II keratins form the heteropolymeric intermediate filament cytoskeleton, which is the main stress-bearing structure within epithelial cells. Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a group of autosomal dominant disorders whose most prominent phenotype is hypertrophic nail dystrophy accompanied by other features of ectodermal dysplasia. It has been shown previously that mutations in either K16 or K6a, which form a keratin expression pair, produce the PC-1 variant (MIM 184510). Mutations in K17 alone, an unpaired accessory keratin, result in the PC-2 phenotype (MIM 184500). Here, we describe a family with PC-2 in which the K17 locus on 17q was excluded and linkage to the type II keratin locus on 12q was obtained (Z max 3.31 at straight theta = 0). Mutation analysis of candidate keratins revealed the first reported missense mutation in K6b, implying that this keratin is the previously unknown expression partner of K17, analogous to the K6a/K16 pair. Co-expression of these genes was confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining. These results reveal the hitherto unknown role of the K6b isoform in epithelial biology, as well as genetic heterogeneity in PC-2.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
14571277,Parietal foramina with cleidocranial dysplasia is caused by mutation in MSX2.,"The combination of skull defects in the form of enlarged parietal foramina (PFM) and deficient ossification of the clavicles is known as parietal foramina with cleidocranial dysplasia (PFMCCD). It is considered to be distinct from classical cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) and is listed as a separate OMIM entry (168550). So far, only two families have been reported and the molecular basis of the disorder is unknown. We present a third family with PFMCCD, comprising four affected individuals in three generations, and demonstrate that a heterozygous tetranucleotide duplication in the MSX2 homeobox gene (505_508dupATTG) segregates with the phenotype. PFMCCD is indeed aetiologically distinct from CCD, which is caused by mutations in the RUNX2 gene, but allelic with isolated PFM, in which MSX2 mutations were previously identified. Our observations highlight the role of MSX2 in clavicular development and the importance of radiological examination of the clavicles in subjects with PFM.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

12118250,Mutations in the gene encoding the lamin B receptor produce an altered nuclear morphology in granulocytes (Pelger-Huët anomaly).,"Pelger-Huët anomaly (PHA; OMIM *169400) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal nuclear shape and chromatin organization in blood granulocytes. Affected individuals show hypolobulated neutrophil nuclei with coarse chromatin. Presumed homozygous individuals have ovoid neutrophil nuclei, as well as varying degrees of developmental delay, epilepsy and skeletal abnormalities. Homozygous offspring in an extinct rabbit lineage showed severe chondrodystrophy, developmental anomalies and increased pre- and postnatal mortality. Here we show, by carrying out a genome-wide linkage scan, that PHA is linked to chromosome 1q41-43. We identified four splice-site, two frameshift and two nonsense mutations in LBR, encoding the lamin B receptor. The lamin B receptor (LBR), a member of the sterol reductase family, is evolutionarily conserved and integral to the inner nuclear membrane; it targets heterochromatin and lamins to the nuclear membrane. Lymphoblastoid cells from heterozygous individuals affected with PHA show reduced expression of the lamin B receptor, and cells homozygous with respect to PHA contain only trace amounts of it. We found that expression of the lamin B receptor affects neutrophil nuclear shape and chromatin distribution in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings have implications for understanding nuclear envelope-heterochromatin interactions, the pathogenesis of Pelger-like conditions in leukemia, infection and toxic drug reactions, and the evolution of neutrophil nuclear shape.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

18795243,Pheochromocytoma in MEN 2A syndrome. Study of 54 patients.,"Pheochromocytoma occurs in nearly 50% of MEN 2A (multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2A) cases. Many issues related to this tumor are still the subject of debate: the diagnostic management in patients who have had positive genetic study results (RET mutation), variations related to mutation, the best surgical option, and the real relapse rate during long-term follow-up. The aim of this study is to present our experience with this unusual disease, looking for answers to some of these questions.Of 169 patients belonging to 19 MEN 2A families, 54 (32%) presented with pheochromocytoma. The following variables have been studied: (1) clinical and diagnostic data [age, mutation, clinical features, results of catecholamines and catabolites in a 24-h urine sample, computerized tomography (CT) scan and iodine-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy results, and the means of diagnostic, clinical, or genetic screening]; (2) surgical treatment; and (3) follow-up and recurrence. The mean follow-up time was 92.5 months (range: 12-120 months).The mean age of the 54 patients was 37.9 years (range: 14-71 years); 33 were women. Most (96.3%) mutations were found in exon 11. The most frequent mutations were Cys634Tyr (in 33 cases [61.1%]) and Cys634Arg (in 14 [25.9%]). The diagnosis of pheocromocytoma was made after the diagnosis of MTC in 26 cases (48.2%), simultaneously in 21 (38.9%), and prior in the 7 remaining cases (12.9%). At the time of diagnosis 28 patients (51.8%) were asymptomatic and 26 (48.2%) had clinical features related to pheochromocytoma. In 6 patients (11.1%), the values of catecholamines and catabolites in urine were normal. In the cases with high values, the most useful isolated determination was that of metanephrines (82%), followed by adrenaline (76%). The CT scan did not provide a correct diagnosis in 6 patients with bilateral lesions, and one patient with a bilateral tumor was not diagnosed by MIBG. The combination of CT scan and MIBG diagnosed 100% of cases. The pheochromocytoma was bilateral in 27 cases, with a total number of 81 pathological glands detected. A laparascopic approach was used in 30 cases and a laparotomy in 24. The mean tumor size was 4.5 cm (range: 1-18 cm). Five patients with unilateral resection relapsed (18.5%), and the mean relapse time was 43.2 months (range: 12-120 months). There was a greater frequency of pheochromocytoma in those subjects who had the Cys634Arg mutation (p < 0.03). In addition, the Cys634Arg mutation is more frequent in bilateral cases. There are no prognostic factors for recurrence.Pheochromocytoma in MEN 2A is related to the type of mutation, which can be early onset and is frequently asymptomatic. Its diagnosis requires catecholamines determinations as well as a CT scan. Correct diagnosis of bilaterality is established by CT and MIBG. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice.",journal article
24152999,A MEN2A family with two asymptomatic carriers affected by unilateral renal agenesis.,"Accumulating evidences suggest RET gene's involvement in development of the kidney in mice and humans. Although it is well known that RET mutation causes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), thus far only 3 individuals have been reported to have MEN2A and renal agenesis/dysgenesis. We report a MEN2A family with RET mutation in which two asymptomatic carriers presented with unilateral renal agenesis. A 48-year-old woman underwent total thyroidectomy with regional lymph node dissection in our department for medullary thyroid carcinoma. She had earlier surgical treatment for a left adrenal pheochromocytoma at the age of 45. In the screening for MEN type 2 for her three sons, a CT scan for adrenal pheochromocytoma incidentally found unilateral renal agenesis in two of the sons, one of whom had suffered from Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). They had contralateral kidneys exhibiting compensatory hypertrophy and normal renal function. Genetic analysis detected C618R RET mutation in the proband and her 3 sons, and no other mutations were found in RET as well as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Our data lend support to the hypothesis that constitutive active RET mutation in MEN type 2 might partially impair RET function and thereby cause loss of function phenotype such as renal agenesis or HSCR.",journal article; case reports
22274720,Patients with RET D631Y mutations most commonly present with pheochromocytoma and not medullary thyroid carcinoma.,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a results from an activating germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. Carriers of a RET mutation are at risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. Most individuals with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a eventually develop medullary thyroid carcinoma and as there is a strong genotype-phenotype correlation, guidelines have been established as to the age recommended for prophylactic thyroidectomy. However for rare mutations in the RET proto-oncogene there is insufficient evidence to provide guidance as to the risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma. We present a family with the rare RET mutation, D631Y in which the proband initially presented with a pheochromocytoma, and review the available literature pertaining to this mutation. In 83% of index cases, pheochromocytoma was the presenting feature and only 37% of adult germline mutation carriers have developed medullary thyroid carcinoma, none of whom have been reported to have nodal or metastatic disease. Patients with a D631Y RET mutation typically present with pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma appears to occur with a later onset than reported with other RET mutations. Based on the current literature we recommend performing prophylactic total thyroidectomy by age 12 years for D631Y carriers although this recommendation may need to be reviewed as additional data becomes available.",journal article
29465928,Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2A (including Familial Medullary Carcinoma) and Type 2B,"Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type 2 A and B autosomal dominant syndromes are rare endocrinopathies characterized by tumors of the C cells of the thyroid, adrenal medulla and parathyroid glands.. MEN2A have either C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) or medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), 50% pheochromocytoma (Pheo), and 20-30% hyperparathyroidism (HPT). Patients with MEN2B have a 100% incidence of CCH or MTC, Pheo (30-50%), a Marfanoid habitus and mucosal neuromas, rarely HPT. About 25% of patients with MTC have one of these familial syndromes. FMTC is a variant of MEN2A. Up to 23% of Pheo patients also have either MEN2 or von-Hippel-Lindau disease. Familial forms of these tumors are multifocal, have hyperplasia as a precursor to frank tumors and different clinical behaviors. Ultrasound, FNA cytology of the thyroid combined with immunostains is recommended to make the diagnosis. The MEN2 RET proto-oncogene, on chromosome 10 (10q11-2), is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase with a long extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and two cytosplasmic tyrosine kinase domains. Patients with MEN-2B typically have a point mutation in the intracellular kinase catalytic domain. The most important biomarker is calcitonin and provocative testing for elevation of TCT in response to pentagastrin or calcium helpful but the diagnosis is made by genetic testing. Fractionated metanephrines are used for pheochromocytoma and PTH for hyperparathyroidism. Screening should be done early and cure can be achieved with total thyroidectomy for MTC and adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma. Recurrent MTC requires history, physical examination, neck ultrasound, and measurement of serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels every 6 months. F-DOPA PET/CT or conventional FDG PET/CT, are able to detect MTC metastases or disease progression. Treatment can be successful with a TKI such as Sunitinib, Vanetanib and Sorafenib.

30085596,"Multiple Endocrine Neoplasias, Type 2 (MEN II, Pheochromocytoma and Amyloid Producing Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma, Sipple Syndrome)","Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), also known as Sipple syndrome,Â is a group of rare familial cancer syndromes involving multiple endocrine organs, most commonly thyroid, adrenal glands, and parathyroid. MEN2 was first described by Sipple in 1961 when he noticed a high association of bilateral pheochromocytomas with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Later, various other tissue and organ involvement was reported in areas that are not classically considered endocrine tissues like gut or skin. MEN2 is an autosomal dominant condition with very high penetrance and variable expressivity. Although MEN2 is rare, recognition is very important both for patient and family member evaluation and treatment. MEN2 is further classified into two subcategories: MEN2A and MEN2B. Both types involve the thyroid and adrenal glands, but MEN2A also causes primary hyperparathyroidism (20 % to 30%). MEN2A is further categorized into the following four subtypes: Classical MEN2A. MEN2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis (CLA)[1]. MEN2A with Hirschsprung disease (HD). Familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC).

22703878,Familial pityriasis rubra pilaris is caused by mutations in CARD14.,"Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a papulosquamous disorder phenotypically related to psoriasis. The disease has been occasionally shown to be inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. To identify the genetic cause of familial PRP, we ascertained four unrelated families affected by autosomal-dominant PRP. We initially mapped PRP to 17q25.3, a region overlapping with psoriasis susceptibility locus 2 (PSORS2 [MIM 602723]). Using a combination of linkage analysis followed by targeted whole-exome sequencing and candidate-gene screening, we identified three different heterozygous mutations in CARD14, which encodes caspase recruitment domain family, member 14. CARD14 was found to be specifically expressed in the skin. CARD14 is a known activator of nuclear factor kappa B signaling, which has been implicated in inflammatory disorders. Accordingly, CARD14 levels were increased, and p65 was found to be activated in the skin of PRP-affected individuals. The present data demonstrate that autosomal-dominant PRP is allelic to familial psoriasis, which was recently shown to also be caused by mutations in CARD14.",brief-report; journal article

These findings reflect the systemic nature of polycystic kidney disease and support the hypothesis that the disorder involves a defect in the extracellular matrix and the cardiac abnormalities are an expression of that defect.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
1513348,Intracranial aneurysms in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Intracranial aneurysms are a feature of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, but their prevalence is uncertain. We studied 92 subjects with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who had no symptoms or signs of any neurologic disorder. To determine the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms, we performed high-resolution computed tomography (CT) in 60 subjects, four-vessel cerebral angiography in 21, and both procedures in 11. RESULTS: Four of the 88 subjects in whom the radiologic studies were successfully completed had intracranial aneurysms (4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 9 percent), as compared with the prevalence of 1 percent reported for an angiographic study of the general population. Three of the four subjects had multiple aneurysms. Seven subjects for whom the results of CT studies were suspicious underwent cerebral angiography: two had aneurysms, and five had normal vascular structures that accounted for the suspicious results of tomography. Four subjects who had normal CT imaging studies also had normal angiographic examinations. Eight of the 32 subjects who underwent angiography (25 percent) had transient complications, as compared with 22 of 220 control subjects (10 percent) who did not have polycystic kidney disease (P less than 0.05). We could not identify any risk factor in these subjects that was related to the occurrence of aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms appear to be more frequent in people with polycystic kidney disease than in the general population, although our 95 percent confidence interval includes the possibility of no difference. Because cerebral angiography is associated with increased morbidity in people with polycystic kidney disease, we recommend high-resolution CT as a screening test.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
12837695,A long-range Shh enhancer regulates expression in the developing limb and fin and is associated with preaxial polydactyly.,"Unequivocal identification of the full composition of a gene is made difficult by the cryptic nature of regulatory elements. Regulatory elements are notoriously difficult to locate and may reside at considerable distances from the transcription units on which they operate and, moreover, may be incorporated into the structure of neighbouring genes. The importance of regulatory mutations as the basis of human abnormalities remains obscure. Here, we show that the chromosome 7q36 associated preaxial polydactyly, a frequently observed congenital limb malformation, results from point mutations in a Shh regulatory element. Shh, normally expressed in the ZPA posteriorly in the limb bud, is expressed in an additional ectopic site at the anterior margin in mouse models of PPD. Our investigations into the basis of the ectopic Shh expression identified the enhancer element that drives normal Shh expression in the ZPA. The regulator, designated ZRS, lies within intron 5 of the Lmbr1 gene 1 Mb from the target gene Shh. The ZRS drives the early spatio-temporal expression pattern in the limb of tetrapods. Despite the morphological differences between limbs and fins, an equivalent regulatory element is found in fish. The ZRS contains point mutations that segregate with polydactyly in four unrelated families with PPD and in the Hx mouse mutant. Thus point mutations residing in long-range regulatory elements are capable of causing congenital abnormalities, and possess the capacity to modify gene activity such that a novel gamut of abnormalities is detected.",journal article
18178630,A microduplication of the long range SHH limb regulator (ZRS) is associated with triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Sonic hedgehog (SHH) plays an important role in defining the anterior-posterior axis in the developing limbs. A highly conserved non-coding sequence about approximately 1 Mb upstream from the sonic hedgehog gene (SHH) was shown to be a long range regulator for SHH expression in the limb bud. Point mutations within this non-coding regulatory region designated ZRS lead to ectopic expression of Shh in the anterior margin of the limb bud, as shown in mice, and cause the human triphalangeal thumb and polysyndactyly (TPT-PS) phenotype. Even though this association is well established, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated a large pedigree with variable TPT-PS. A single nucleotide exchange within the SHH limb regulator sequence was excluded, but locus specific microsatellite marker analyses confirmed a linkage to this region. Subsequently, array comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH) was carried out using a submegabase whole human genome tiling path bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array revealing a microduplication in 7q36.3 in affected individuals. A duplicated region of 588,819 bp comprising the ZRS was identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and direct sequencing. CONCLUSION: A novel microduplication in 7q36.3 results in a similar TPT-PS phenotype as caused by single nucleotide alterations in the ZRS, the limb specific SHH regulatory element. Duplications can be added to the growing list of mechanisms that cause abnormalities of long range transcriptional control.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15031030,A combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia associated with mutations in MADH4 (SMAD4).,"BACKGROUND: Juvenile polyposis and hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia are autosomal dominant disorders with distinct and non-overlapping clinical features. The former, an inherited gastrointestinal malignancy predisposition, is caused by mutations in MADH4 (encoding SMAD4) or BMPR1A, and the latter is a vascular malformation disorder caused by mutations in ENG (endoglin) or ACVRL1 (ALK1). All four genes encode proteins involved in the transforming-growth-factor-beta signalling pathway. Although there are reports of patients and families with phenotypes of both disorders combined, the genetic aetiology of this association is unknown. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from seven unrelated families segregating both phenotypes. DNA from the proband of each family was sequenced for the ACVRL1, ENG, and MADH4 genes. Mutations were examined for familial cosegregation with phenotype and presence or absence in population controls. Findings No patient had mutations in the ENG or ACVRL1 genes; all had MADH4 mutations. Three cases of de-novo MADH4 mutations were found. In one, the mutation was passed on to a similarly affected child. Each mutation cosegregated with the syndromic phenotype in other affected family members. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in MADH4 can cause a syndrome consisting of both juvenile polyposis and hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia phenotypes. Since patients with these disorders are generally ascertained through distinct medical specialties, genetic testing is recommended for patients presenting with either phenotype to identify those at risk of this syndrome. Patients with juvenile polyposis who have an MADH4 mutation should be screened for the vascular lesions associated with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, especially occult arteriovenous malformations in visceral organs that may otherwise present suddenly with serious medical consequences.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
1329510,Risk of hepatoblastoma in familial adenomatous polyposis.,"Infantile and childhood hepatoblastoma occurs more frequently in persons heterozygous for the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) gene than in the general population. This observation is based on numerous case reports plus the results of an international survey of FAP registries. However, the frequency of this rare tumor in FAP patients is unknown. In a retrospective review of our family history data, 2/470 (0.42%) children born to 241 patients with FAP had hepatoblastoma. This figure is significantly higher than the 1/100,000 incidence of hepatoblastoma in the general population. However, for genetic counseling purposes, an empiric risk of less than 1% for hepatoblastoma can be cited to persons with FAP for their children.",journal article; case reports
22425061,The prevalence of thyroid cancer and benign thyroid disease in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis may be higher than previously recognized.,"PURPOSE: Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and extracolonic neoplasms. The prevalence of thyroid cancer (TC) and benign thyroid disease in this patient population is unclear, and guidelines for screening for TC in these patients are not well established. The purpose of this study was to report the prevalence of TC and benign thyroid disease in patients with FAP. METHODS: The prospectively maintained Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Family Registry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was queried to identify patients with FAP and with TC and/or benign thyroid disease. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients with FAP were identified. There were 30 men and 36 women, with a median age of 38.6 years. Four (6.1%) patients had a history of TC. All were women, with a mean age at TC diagnosis of 36.5 years. Three of the 4 TCs were papillary thyroid cancer. Two patients with TC presented with palpable nodules. An additional 6 (9.1%) patients with FAP had a history of benign thyroid disease, including nodules (3), hypothyroidism (2), cysts (2), goiter (1), and thyroiditis (1). Three of 4 patients with TC and all 6 patients with benign thyroid disease had other extracolonic manifestations associated with FAP. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalences of TC (6.1%) and benign thyroid disease (9.1%) are increased in our patients with FAP and are higher than noted in some previous reports. Periodic thyroid ultrasound screening should be considered in patients with FAP to further elucidate the prevalence and for possible early detection of TC and benign thyroid disease in this population.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
14960520,Duodenal adenomatosis in familial adenomatous polyposis.,"BACKGROUND:The prevalence of duodenal carcinoma is much higher in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) than in the background population, and duodenal adenomatosis is found in most polyposis patients. AIMS:To describe the long term natural history of duodenal adenomatosis in FAP and evaluate if cancer prophylactic surveillance of the duodenum is indicated. METHODS:A prospective five nation study was carried out in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands. PATIENTS:A total of 368 patients were examined by gastroduodenoscopy at two year intervals during the period 1990-2001. RESULTS:At the first endoscopy, 238 (65%) patients had duodenal adenomas at a median age of 38 years. Median follow up was 7.6 years. The cumulative incidence of adenomatosis at age 70 years was 90% (95% confidence interval (CI) 79-100%), and of Spigelman stage IV 52% (95% CI 28-76%). The probability of an advanced Spigelman score increased during the study period (p<0.0001) due to an increasing number and size of adenomas. Two patients had asymptomatic duodenal carcinoma at their first endoscopy while four developed carcinoma during the study at a median age of 52 years (range 26-58). The cumulative incidence rate of cancer was 4.5% at age 57 years (95% CI 0.1-8.9%) and the risk was higher in patients with Spigelman stage IV at their first endoscopy than in those with stages 0-III (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS:The natural course of duodenal adenomatosis has now been described in detail. The high incidence and increasing severity of duodenal adenomatosis with age justifies prophylactic examination, and a programme is presented for upper gastrointestinal endoscopic surveillance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; multicenter study; journal article"
11156460,Adrenal masses are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis.,"PURPOSE:Although its defining feature is the development of multiple large-bowel polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis is a generalized disorder of tissue growth regulation, with a range of manifestations. An association between adrenal neoplasms and familial adenomatous polyposis has been suggested, but not prospectively documented. Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis were therefore screened to determine the frequency of adrenal masses. METHODS:Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis underwent spiral abdominal CT scan reported by two radiologists specialized in cross-sectional imaging. RESULTS:One hundred seven individuals were examined (median age, 36 (interquartile range, 30-48) years; 57 male). Fourteen (13 percent) had an adrenal mass of 1 cm or greater (bilateral in one case); none had clinical evidence of endocrine disturbance or hypertension. Two lesions were histologically confirmed adrenocortical adenomas and one a phaeochromocytoma; the remaining 12 had CT appearances of nonhyperfunctioning adrenocortical adenoma. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence of unsuspected adrenal masses in the general population is approximately three percent. This prospective study found a significantly higher frequency of 13 percent in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (chi-squared = 6.973; df = 1; P = 0.008). There is no evidence that the histologic nature of these differs from that in the general population.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Peutz-Jeghers polyps occur most numerously in the small intestine but frequently in the colon and stomach, only a few cases have been reported in the duodenum.A further family history survey discovered 10 out of 14 members of the family (in 4 generations) had mucocutaneous pigmentations, but many of them were living in rural areas where they had no access to specialized medical services, so none were checked with endoscopy for polyps of hamartoma.We report the case of a boy patient with mucocutaneous pigmentations over the lips, and a history of recurrent bouts of vomit and anemia over the preceding two years, no abdominal pain and mass. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed some small polyps in the stomach and multiple sessile polyps in the second part of the duodenum, but colonoscopy exam did not reveal any lesion.A double polypectomy and duodenum segmentary resection with end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Histopathology of the resected duodenum polyps indicated it to be a typical hamartomatous polyp.The child was under regular follow-up and recovered well.In this case, the patient was characteristic with pigmentations on his lips and intermittent upper intestinal obstruction (due to mass duodenal polyps), there are no definitive guidelines for the treatment to duodenal PJS hamartomatous polyp, each case requires tailor-made management.",review; journal article; case reports; case-report
3587280,Increased risk of cancer in the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.,"The Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease characterized by hamartomatous polyps of the gastrointestinal tract and by mucocutaneous melanin deposits. The frequency of cancer in this syndrome has not been studied extensively. Therefore, we investigated 31 patients with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome who were followed from 1973 to 1985. All cases of cancer were verified by histopathological review. Cancer developed in 15 of the 31 patients (48 percent)--gastrointestinal carcinomas in 4, nongastrointestinal carcinomas in 10, and multiple myeloma in 1. In addition, adenomatous polyps of the stomach and colon occurred in three other patients. The cancers were diagnosed when the patients were relatively young, but after the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome had been diagnosed (interval between diagnoses, 25 +/- 20 years; range, 1 to 64). According to relative-risk analysis, the observed development of cancer in the patients with the syndrome was 18 times greater than expected in the general population (P less than 0.0001). Our results suggest that patients with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome have an increased risk for the development of cancer at gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal sites.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25975287,PDGFRA-mutant syndrome.,"Germline PDGFRA mutations cause multiple heterogeneous gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors. In its familial form this disease, which was formerly termed intestinal neurofibromatosis/neurofibromatosis 3b (INF/NF3b), has been included among familial gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) because of its genotype, described when GIST was the only known PDGFRA-mutant gastrointestinal tumor. Shortly afterwards, however, inflammatory fibroid polyps also revealed PDGFRA mutations. Subsequently, gastrointestinal CD34+ 'fibrous tumors' of uncertain classification were described in a germline PDGFRA-mutant context. Our aim was to characterize the syndrome produced by germline PDGFRA mutations and establish diagnostic criteria and management strategies for this hitherto puzzling disease. We studied a kindred displaying multiple gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors, comparing it with published families/individuals with possible analogous conditions. We identified a novel inherited PDGFRA mutation (P653L), constituting the third reported example of familial PDGFRA mutation. In adult mutants we detected inflammatory fibroid polyps, gastric GISTs and gastrointestinal fibrous tumors of uncertain nosology. We demonstrate that the syndrome formerly defined as INF/NF3b (exemplified by the family reported herein) is simplistically considered a form of familial GIST, because inflammatory fibroid polyps often prevail. Fibrous tumors appear variants of inflammatory fibroid polyps. 'INF/NF3b' and 'familial GIST' are misleading terms which we propose changing to 'PDGFRA-mutant syndrome'. In this condition, unlike KIT-dependent familial GIST syndromes, if present, GISTs are stomach-restricted and diffuse Cajal cell hyperplasia is not observed. This restriction of GISTs to the stomach in PDGFRA-mutant syndrome: (i) focuses oncological concern on gastric masses, as inflammatory fibroid polyps are benign; (ii) supports a selective role of gastric environment for PDGFRA mutations to elicit GISTs, justifying the known predilection for stomach of sporadic PDGFRA-mutant GISTs. An awareness that inflammatory fibroid polyps, relatively common among gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors, may be the prevailing tumor in PDGFRA-mutant syndrome could eventually reveal an unsuspected prevalence of this condition.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
15739154,Molecular and clinical analyses of Greig cephalopolysyndactyly and Pallister-Hall syndromes: robust phenotype prediction from the type and position of GLI3 mutations.,"Mutations in the GLI3 zinc-finger transcription factor gene cause Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) and Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), which are variable but distinct clinical entities. We hypothesized that GLI3 mutations that predict a truncated functional repressor protein cause PHS and that functional haploinsufficiency of GLI3 causes GCPS. To test these hypotheses, we screened patients with PHS and GCPS for GLI3 mutations. The patient group consisted of 135 individuals: 89 patients with GCPS and 46 patients with PHS. We detected 47 pathological mutations (among 60 probands); when these were combined with previously published mutations, two genotype-phenotype correlations were evident. First, GCPS was caused by many types of alterations, including translocations, large deletions, exonic deletions and duplications, small in-frame deletions, and missense, frameshift/nonsense, and splicing mutations. In contrast, PHS was caused only by frameshift/nonsense and splicing mutations. Second, among the frameshift/nonsense mutations, there was a clear genotype-phenotype correlation. Mutations in the first third of the gene (from open reading frame [ORF] nucleotides [nt] 1-1997) caused GCPS, and mutations in the second third of the gene (from ORF nt 1998-3481) caused primarily PHS. Surprisingly, there were 12 mutations in patients with GCPS in the 3' third of the gene (after ORF nt 3481), and no patients with PHS had mutations in this region. These results demonstrate a robust correlation of genotype and phenotype for GLI3 mutations and strongly support the hypothesis that these two allelic disorders have distinct modes of pathogenesis.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
11484201,Phenotype of five patients with Greig syndrome and microdeletion of 7p13.,"Here we describe five patients with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), including one pair of monozygotic twin boys with a de novo microdeletion involving the chromosomal band 7p13, where various clinical manifestations, in addition to GCPS, were recognized. Besides the twin pair, all patients are unrelated. Since there is a considerable lack of well-defined clinical delineation of the few patients with microdeletions involving 7p13 with GCPS described so far, we focus on the symptoms that are not typically related to GCPS, such as moderate psychomotor retardation, seizures, muscle fiber anomalies, cardiac anomalies, hyperglycemia, and hirsutism. Our observations suggest that in all cases of atypical GCPS, the presence of a cytogenetically detectable microdeletion or a submicroscopic deletion of 7p13 should be suspected.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
22043168,Prader-Willi Syndrome: Obesity due to Genomic Imprinting.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder due to errors in genomic imprinting with loss of imprinted genes that are paternally expressed from the chromosome 15q11-q13 region. Approximately 70% of individuals with PWS have a de novo deletion of the paternally derived 15q11-q13 region in which there are two subtypes (i.e., larger Type I or smaller Type II), maternal disomy 15 (both 15s from the mother) in about 25% of cases, and the remaining subjects have either defects in the imprinting center controlling the activity of imprinted genes or due to other chromosome 15 rearrangements. PWS is characterized by a particular facial appearance, infantile hypotonia, a poor suck and feeding difficulties, hypogonadism and hypogenitalism in both sexes, short stature and small hands and feet due to growth hormone deficiency, mild learning and behavioral problems (e.g., skin picking, temper tantrums) and hyperphagia leading to early childhood obesity. Obesity is a significant health problem, if uncontrolled. PWS is considered the most common known genetic cause of morbid obesity in children. The chromosome 15q11-q13 region contains approximately 100 genes and transcripts in which about 10 are imprinted and paternally expressed. This region can be divided into four groups: 1) a proximal non-imprinted region; 2) a PWS paternal-only expressed region containing protein-coding and non-coding genes; 3) an Angelman syndrome region containing maternally expressed genes and 4) a distal non-imprinted region. This review summarizes the current understanding of the genetic causes, the natural history and clinical presentation of individuals with PWS.",letter
16838330,Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome: review of the phenotype.,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare but well known entity characterized by extreme short stature, low body weight, early loss of hair, lipodystrophy, scleroderma, decreased joint mobility, osteolysis, and facial features that resemble aged persons. Cardiovascular compromise leads to early demise. Cognitive development is normal. Data on 10 of our own cases and 132 cases from literature are presented. The incidence in the last century in the Netherlands was 1:4,000,000. Sex ratio was 1.2:1. Main first symptoms were failure to thrive (55%), hair loss (40%), skin problems (28%), and lipodystrophy (20%). Mean age at diagnosis was 2.9 years. Growth in weight was more disturbed than growth in height, and growth delay started already prenatally. Mean height > 13 years was 109.0 cm, mean weight was 14.5 kg. Osteolysis was wide-spread but not expressed, except in the viscerocranium, and remained limited to membranous formed bone. Lipodystrophy is generalized, only intra-abdominal fat depositions remain present. Cardiovascular problems are extremely variable, both in age of onset and nature. Stroke and coronary dysfunctioning are most frequent. Pathologic findings in coronaries and aorta resemble sometimes the findings in elderly persons, but can also be much more limited. Loss of smooth muscle cells seems the most important finding. Mean age of demise was 12.6 years. Patients can be subdivided in patients with classical HGPS, which follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, (almost) all cases representing spontaneous mutations, and in non-classical progeria, in whom growth can be less retarded, scalp hair remains present for a longer time, lipodystrophy is more slowly progressive, osteolysis is more expressed except in the face, and survival well into adulthood is not uncommon. Pattern of inheritance of non-classical progeria is most probably autosomal recessive. The cause of HGPS is an abnormally formed Lamin A, either directly by a mutated LMNA gene, or through abnormal posttranslational processing (ZMPSTE24 gene mutations). Of 34 LMNA mutations found in progeria patients, there were 26 classical p.G608G mutations (76%). Pathogenesis is most likely to follow several different pathways. Potential therapeutic strategies are developed along these lines and include RNA interference techniques and inhibition of the dominant-negative influence of abnormally formed Lamin A on polymerization with normally formed Lamin A.",review; journal article
21793738,A mosaic activating mutation in AKT1 associated with the Proteus syndrome.,"BACKGROUND:The Proteus syndrome is characterized by the overgrowth of skin, connective tissue, brain, and other tissues. It has been hypothesized that the syndrome is caused by somatic mosaicism for a mutation that is lethal in the nonmosaic state. METHODS:We performed exome sequencing of DNA from biopsy samples obtained from patients with the Proteus syndrome and compared the resultant DNA sequences with those of unaffected tissues obtained from the same patients. We confirmed and extended an observed association, using a custom restriction-enzyme assay to analyze the DNA in 158 samples from 29 patients with the Proteus syndrome. We then assayed activation of the AKT protein in affected tissues, using phosphorylation-specific antibodies on Western blots. RESULTS:Of 29 patients with the Proteus syndrome, 26 had a somatic activating mutation (c.49Gâ†’A, p.Glu17Lys) in the oncogene AKT1, encoding the AKT1 kinase, an enzyme known to mediate processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. Tissues and cell lines from patients with the Proteus syndrome harbored admixtures of mutant alleles that ranged from 1% to approximately 50%. Mutant cell lines showed greater AKT phosphorylation than did control cell lines. A pair of single-cell clones that were established from the same starting culture and differed with respect to their mutation status had different levels of AKT phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS:The Proteus syndrome is caused by a somatic activating mutation in AKT1, proving the hypothesis of somatic mosaicism and implicating activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway in the characteristic clinical findings of overgrowth and tumor susceptibility in this disorder.

20301660,Pseudoachondroplasia,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Pseudoachondroplasia is characterized by normal length at birth and normal facies. Often the presenting feature is a waddling gait, recognized at the onset of walking. Typically, the growth rate falls below the standard growth curve by approximately age two years, leading to a moderately severe form of disproportionate short-limb short stature. Joint pain during childhood, particularly in the large joints of the lower extremities, is common. Degenerative joint disease is progressive; approximately 50% of individuals with pseudoachondroplasia eventually require hip replacement surgery. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of pseudoachondroplasia can be made on the basis of clinical findings and radiographic features. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COMP on molecular genetic testing establishes the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Analgesics for joint pain; osteotomy for lower-limb malalignment; C1-C2 fixation for symptoms and radiographic evidence of cervical spine instability; rarely, surgery for scoliosis; attention to and social support for psychosocial issues related to short stature for affected individuals and their families. Prevention of secondary complications: Encourage physical activities that do not cause excessive wear and/or damage to the joints. Surveillance: Regular examinations for evidence of symptomatic lower limb malalignment, kyphoscoliosis, symptomatic joint hypermobility, degenerative joint disease, and neurologic manifestations, particularly spinal cord compression secondary to odontoid hypoplasia. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In those with odontoid hypoplasia, extreme neck flexion and extension should be avoided. GENETIC COUNSELING:Pseudoachondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Some individuals diagnosed with pseudoachondroplasia have an affected parent; the proportion of pseudoachondroplasia resulting from a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with pseudoachondroplasia and a reproductive partner with normal bone growth has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and having pseudoachondroplasia. Because many individuals with short stature select reproductive partners with short stature, offspring of individuals with pseudoachondroplasia may be at risk of having double heterozygosity for two dominantly inherited bone growth disorders. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk for pseudoachondroplasia is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",book; review
21599986,A novel COMP mutation in a pseudoachondroplasia family of Chinese origin.,"Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) is caused exclusively by mutations in the gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). Only a small number of studies have documented the clinical phenotype and genetic basis in Chinese PSACH patients.We investigated a four-generation PSACH pedigree of Chinese Han origin. Two patients and two unaffected individuals were recruited for clinical evaluation and molecular genetic analysis. The genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was adopted to amplify the 8-19 exons of COMP gene. Then the products were sequenced bi-directionally for screening mutation. Clinical evaluation revealed that PSACH patients in this pedigree had a severe disproportionate short stature (-10SD). A heterozygous TGTCCCTGG insertion in exon 13, between nucleotide 1352T and 1353G, were identified in the patients except the unaffected individuals, which resulted in a three-amino-acid insertion (451V_452P ins VPG) in the sixth calmodulin-like repeat of the COMP protein.This c. 1352_1353ins TGTCCCTGG is a novel mutation responsible for severe familial PSACH.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27933191,Genetics of inherited cardiocutaneous syndromes: a review.,"The life of a human being originates as a single cell which, under the influence of certain factors, divides sequentially into multiple cells that subsequently become committed to develop and differentiate into the different structures and organs. Alterations occurring early on in the development process may lead to fetal demise in utero. Conversely, abnormalities at later stages may result in structural and/or functional abnormalities of varying severities. The cardiovascular system and skin share certain developmental and structural factors; therefore, it is not surprising to find several inherited syndromes with both cardiac and skin manifestations. Here, we will review the overlapping pathways in the development of the skin and heart, as well as the resulting syndromes. We will also highlight several cutaneous clues that may help physicians screen and uncover cardiac anomalies that may be otherwise hidden and result in sudden cardiac death.",review-article; review; journal article
19100526,Genetic defects in surfactant protein A2 are associated with pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal scarring lung disease that affects older adults. Heterozygous rare mutations in the genes encoding telomerase are found in approximately 15% of familial cases. We have used linkage to map another disease-causing gene in a large family with IPF and adenocarcinoma of the lung to a 15.7 Mb region on chromosome 10. We identified a rare missense mutation in a candidate gene, SFTPA2, within the interval encoding surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2). Another rare mutation in SFTPA2 was identified in another family with IPF and lung cancer. Both mutations involve invariant residues in the highly conserved carbohydrate-recognition domain of the protein and are predicted to disrupt protein structure. Recombinant proteins carrying these mutations are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and are not secreted. These data are consistent with SFTPA2 germline mutations that interfere with protein trafficking and cause familial IPF and lung cancer.",research-article; review; journal article

Eight of the 17 subjects had evidence of alveolar inflammation on the lavage studies. Supporting data included increased numbers of neutrophils and activated macrophages that released one or more neutrophil chemoattractants, and growth factors for lung fibroblasts--findings similar to those observed in patients with overt idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Four of these eight also had a positive gallium scan; in all the other clinically unaffected subjects the scan was normal. During a follow-up of two to four years in seven of the eight subjects who had evidence of inflammation, no clinical evidence of pulmonary fibrosis has appeared. These results indicate that alveolar inflammation occurs in approximately half the clinically unaffected family members at risk of inheriting autosomal dominant idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Whether these persons with evidence of pulmonary inflammation but no fibrosis will proceed to have clinically evident pulmonary fibrosis is not yet known.",journal article; case reports; case-report
30854216,A novel germline mutation of the SFTPA1 gene in familial interstitial pneumonia.,"Different genes related to alveolar stability have been associated with familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP). Here, we report a novel, rare SFTPA1 variant in a family with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). We performed whole-exome sequencing on germline DNA samples from four members of one family; three of them showed signs of pulmonary fibrosis (idiopathic interstitial pneumonia) with autosomal-dominant inheritance. A heterozygous single nucleotide variant c.532 G > A in the SFTPA1 gene has been identified. This variant encodes the substitution p.(Val178Met), localized within the carbohydrate recognition domain of surfactant protein A and segregates with the genes causing idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. This rare variant has not been previously reported. We also analyzed the detected sequence variant in the protein structure in silico. The replacement of valine by the larger methionine inside the protein may cause a disruption in the protein structure. The c.532 G > A variant was further validated using Sanger sequencing of the amplicons, confirming the diagnosis in all symptomatic family members. Moreover, this variant was also found by Sanger sequencing in one other symptomatic family member and one young asymptomatic family member. The autosomal-dominant inheritance, the family history of IIP, and the evidence of a mutation occurring in part of the SFTPA1 gene all suggest a novel variant that causes FIP.",research-article; journal article
9729004,Primary pulmonary hypertension.,"Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a progressive disease characterised by raised pulmonary vascular resistance, which results in diminished right-heart function due to increased right ventricular afterload. PPH occurs most commonly in young and middle-aged women; mean survival from onset of symptoms is 2-3 years. The aetiology of PPH is unknown, although familial disease accounts for roughly 10% of cases, which suggests a genetic predisposition. Current theories on pathogenesis focus on abnormalities in interaction between endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. Endothelia-cell injury may result in an imbalance in endothelium-derived mediators, favouring vasoconstriction. Defects in ion-channel activity in smooth-muscle cells in the pulmonary artery may contribute to vasoconstriction and vascular proliferation. Diagnostic testing primarily excludes secondary causes. Catheterisation is necessary to assess haemodynamics and to evaluate vasoreactivity during acute drug challenge. Decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance in response to acute vasodilator challenge occurs in about 30% of patients, and predicts a good response to chronic therapy with oral calcium-channel blockers. For patients unresponsive during acute testing, continuous intravenous epoprostenol (prostacyclin, PGI2) improves haemodynamics and exercise tolerance, and prolongs survival in severe PPH (NYHA functional class III-IV). Thoracic transplantation is reserved for patients who fail medical therapy. We review the progress made in diagnosis and treatment of PPH over the past 20 years.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; review; journal article"
3090825,Hereditary leaky red cell syndrome in a Swiss family.,"A Swiss family was found to have a hereditary hemolytic disorder associated with excessively leaky red cell membranes. Hemolysis was mild and fully compensated. Membrane lipid analysis revealed an increased phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylethanolamine ratio. Membrane leaks included an increased permeability to sodium, potassium, calcium and, possibly, creatine. It is suggested that in hemolytic states, the combined finding of reticulocytosis and normal red cell creatine might be an easily obtainable clue to the presence of a leaky red cell syndrome.",abstract
21882293,Extending the phenotypes associated with DICER1 mutations.,"DICER1 is crucial for embryogenesis and early development. Forty different heterozygous germline DICER1 mutations have been reported worldwide in 42 probands that developed as children or young adults, pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), cystic nephroma (CN), ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors (especially Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor [SLCT]), and/or multinodular goiter (MNG). We report DICER1 mutations in seven additional families that manifested uterine cervix embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (cERMS, four cases) and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (cPNET, one case), Wilms tumor (WT, three cases), pulmonary sequestration (PS, one case), and juvenile intestinal polyp (one case). One carrier developed (age 25 years) a pleomorphic sarcoma of the thigh; another carrier had transposition of great arteries (TGA). These observations show that cERMS, cPNET, WT, PS, and juvenile polyps fall within the spectrum of DICER1-related diseases. DICER1 appears to be the first gene implicated in the etiology of cERMS, cPNET, and PS. Young adulthood sarcomas and perhaps congenital malformations such as TGA may also be associated.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
7387508,"Ring dermoid syndrome. A new syndrome of autosomal dominantly inherited, bilateral, annular limbal dermoids with corneal and conjunctival extension.","A new hereditary syndrome of bilateral ocular dermoids is described in five patients from three generations of a single family. There were no associated extraocular anomalies. The choristomas involved the limbus for 360 degrees, extended anteriorly onto the cornea, and extended posteriorly about 5 mm within the conjunctiva for 360 degrees. Additional clinical findings of diagnostic value were conjunctival plaques of keratinization, hairs, and corneal lipid deposition. An irregular corneal astigmatism, amblyopia, and concomitant strabismus were secondary features. The unique bilateral, annular configuration of the dermoids is pathognomonic of this syndrome. Early surgical intervention is indicated to try to improve the visual prognosis and cosmesis. At surgery, the conjunctival portion of one case was easily resected in toto, but the limbal portion required partial excision. Histopathological examination confirmed the clinical diagnosis of dermoid choristoma.",research-article; journal article

17942008,Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome: clinical and molecular overview.,"Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is characterised by mental retardation, growth retardation and a particular dysmorphology. The syndrome is rare, with a frequency of approximately one affected individual in 100,000 newborns. Mutations in two genes - CREBBP and EP300 - have been identified to cause the syndrome. These two genes show strong homology and encode histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which are transcriptional co-activators involved in many signalling pathways. Loss of HAT activity is sufficient to account for the phenomena seen in Rubinstein-Taybi patients. Although some mutations found in CREBBP are translocations, inversions and large deletions, most are point mutations or small deletions and insertions. Mutations in EP300 are comparatively rare. Extensive screening of patients has revealed mutations in CREBBP and EP300 in around 50% of cases. The cause of the syndrome in the remaining patients remains to be identified, but other genes could also be involved. Here, we describe the clinical presentation of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, review the mutation spectrum and discuss the current understanding of causative molecular mechanisms.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
7669819,Periodic catatonia: a schizophrenic subtype with major gene effect and anticipation.,"In a family study involving 139 probands with DSM-III-R catatonic schizophrenia and 543 first-degree relatives, we investigated age-specific morbidity risk according to Leonhard's clinical distinction between systematic and periodic catatonia. This dichotomy is based on different types of symptomatology, course, and outcome. In systematic catatonia the age-corrected morbidity risk was 4.6%. In periodic catatonia, however, there was an age-corrected morbidity risk with homogenous psychoses of 26.9%, and more parents than siblings were affected. This points strongly to a major gene effect in periodic catatonia. Furthermore, a pairwise comparison of patients and their parents revealed patterns of anticipation, i.e., the probands' age at the onset of disease was significantly earlier than that of their parents (P < 0.001). Similarly, anticipation was apparent in pedigrees with three successive generations affected. This inheritance pattern with homogenous psychoses and anticipation indicates that genes with trinucleotid repeat expansion or other repetitive elements affecting gene expression may be involved in the etiology of periodic catatonia. Thus, periodic catatonia as a specific clinical subtype of schizophrenia is a promising candidate for molecular genetic evaluation.",comparative study; journal article; case reports
17673550,Oncogenic PIK3CA mutations occur in epidermal nevi and seborrheic keratoses with a characteristic mutation pattern.,"Activating mutations of the p110 alpha subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) oncogene have been identified in a broad spectrum of malignant tumors. However, their role in benign or preneoplastic conditions is unknown. Activating FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3) mutations are common in benign skin lesions, either as embryonic mutations in epidermal nevi (EN) or as somatic mutations in seborrheic keratoses (SK). FGFR3 mutations are also common in low-grade malignant bladder tumors, where they often occur in association with PIK3CA mutations. Therefore, we examined exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA and FGFR3 hotspot mutations in EN (n = 33) and SK (n = 62), two proliferative skin lesions lacking malignant potential. Nine of 33 (27%) EN harbored PIK3CA mutations; all cases showed the E545G substitution, which is uncommon in cancers. In EN, R248C was the only FGFR3 mutation identified. By contrast, 10 of 62 (16%) SK revealed the typical cancer-associated PIK3CA mutations E542K, E545K, and H1047R. The same lesions displayed a wide range of FGFR3 mutations. Corresponding unaffected tissue was available for four EN and two mutant SK: all control samples displayed a WT sequence, confirming the somatic nature of the mutations found in lesional tissue. Forty of 95 (42%) lesions showed at least one mutation in either gene. PIK3CA and FGFR3 mutations displayed an independent distribution; 5/95 lesions harbored mutations in both genes. Our findings suggest that, in addition to their role in cancer, oncogenic PIK3CA mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of skin tumors lacking malignant potential. The remarkable genotype-phenotype correlation as observed in this study points to a distinct etiopathogenesis of the mutations in keratinocytes occuring either during fetal development or in adult life.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Here we demonstrate that mutations in HSPA9, a mitochondrial HSP70 homolog located in the chromosome 5q deletion syndrome 5q33 critical deletion interval and involved in mitochondrial Fe-S biogenesis, result in CSA inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In a fraction of patients with just 1 severe loss-of-function allele, expression of the clinical phenotype is associated with a common coding single nucleotide polymorphism in trans that correlates with reduced messenger RNA expression and results in a pseudodominant pattern of inheritance.","brief-report; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

It is suggested that the study of red blood cell size distribution curves may add valuable information on the pattern of inheritance in other families with hereditary sideroblastic anaemia.,journal article
15884042,Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome: fourteen new patients and a clinical analysis.,"The Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is a disorder of unknown cause comprising craniosynostosis, a marfanoid habitus and skeletal, neurological, cardiovascular, and connective-tissue anomalies. There are no pathognomonic signs of SGS and diagnosis depends on recognition of a characteristic combination of anomalies. Here, we describe 14 persons with SGS and compare their clinical findings with those of 23 previously reported individuals, including two families with more than one affected individual. Our analysis suggests that there is a characteristic facial appearance, with more than two thirds of all individuals having hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, a high-arched palate, micrognathia, and apparently low-set and posteriorly rotated ears. Other commonly reported manifestations include hypotonia in at least the neonatal period, developmental delay, and inguinal or umbilical hernia. The degree of reported intellectual impairment ranges from mild to severe. The most common skeletal manifestations in SGS were arachnodactyly, pectus deformity, camptodactyly, scoliosis, and joint hypermobility. None of the skeletal signs alone is specific for SGS. Our study includes 14 mainly German individuals with SGS evaluated over a period of 10 years. Given that only 23 other persons with SGS have been reported to date worldwide, we suggest that SGS may be more common than previously assumed.",journal article
17539903,"Gender, genotype, and phenotype differences in Smith-Magenis syndrome: a meta-analysis of 105 cases.","Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a multisystem disorder characterized by developmental delay and mental retardation, a distinctive behavioral phenotype, and sleep disturbance. We undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis to identify genotype-phenotype relationships to further understand the clinical variability and genetic factors involved in SMS. Clinical and molecular information on 105 patients with SMS was obtained through research protocols and a review of the literature and analyzed using Fisher's exact test with two-tailed p values. Several differences in these groups of patients were identified based on genotype and gender. Patients with RAI1 mutation were more likely to exhibit overeating, obesity, polyembolokoilamania, self-hugging, muscle cramping, and dry skin and less likely to have short stature, hearing loss, frequent ear infections, and heart defects when compared with patients with deletion, while a subset of small deletion cases with deletions spanning from TNFRSF13B to MFAP4 was less likely to exhibit brachycephaly, dental anomalies, iris abnormalities, head-banging, and hyperactivity. Significant differences between genders were also identified, with females more likely to have myopia, eating/appetite problems, cold hands and feet, and frustration with communication when compared with males. These results confirm previous findings and identify new genotype-phenotype associations including differences in the frequency of short stature, hearing loss, ear infections, obesity, overeating, heart defects, self-injury, self-hugging, dry skin, seizures, and hyperactivity among others based on genotype. Additional studies are required to further explore the relationships between genotype and phenotype and any potential discrepancies in health care and parental attitudes toward males and females with SMS.","meta-analysis; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
11445803,Inversion of the circadian rhythm of melatonin in the Smith-Magenis syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the circadian rhythm of melatonin in the Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), which causes behavioral problems and sleep disturbance. STUDY DESIGN: Questionnaires, sleep consultations, and sleep diaries were obtained in 20 children with SMS (9 girls, 11 boys aged 4 to 17 years). Actigraphy, electroencephalography, and the circadian variations of plasma melatonin, cortisol, and growth hormone were recorded in 8 patients. Early sleep onset, early sleep offset, and sleep attack indicated sleep disturbance. RESULTS: All children with SMS had a phase shift of their circadian rhythm of melatonin. Time at onset of melatonin secretion was 6 AM +/- 2 (control group: 9 P.M. +/- 2). Peak time was 12 PM +/- 1 (control group: 3:30 AM +/- 1:30), and melatonin offset was at 8 PM +/- 1 (control group: 6 AM +/- 1). Behavioral problems correlated with the inverted circadian rhythm of melatonin. CONCLUSION: Considering that clock genes mediate the generation of circadian rhythms, we suggest that haploinsufficiency for a circadian system gene mapping to chromosome 17p11.2 may cause the inversion of the circadian rhythm of melatonin in SMS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16688749,Genotype-phenotype correlations in mapped split hand foot malformation (SHFM) patients.,"Split hand foot malformation (SHFM) also known as central ray deficiency, ectrodactyly and cleft hand/foot, is one of the most complex of limb malformations. SHFM can occur as an isolated malformation or in association with other malformations, as in the ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (EEC) syndrome and other autosomal dominant conditions with long bone involvement, all showing variable expressivity and reduced penetrance. The deficiency in SHFM patients can also be accompanied by other distal limb anomalies including polydactyly and/or syndactyly. This variability causes the phenotypic classification of SHFM to be far from straightforward and genetic heterogeneity, with at least five loci identified to date, further complicates management of affected patients and their families. Although genotypic-phenotypic correlations have been proposed at the molecular level for SHFM4 patients who have mutations in the P63 gene, phenotypic correlations at the chromosomal level have not been thoroughly documented. Using descriptive epidemiology, Chi square and discriminant function analyses, our laboratory has identified phenotypic patterns associated with the mapped genetic SHFM loci. These findings can assist in classification, provide insight into responsible developmental genes and assist in directing mapping efforts and targeted genetic testing, resulting in more accurate information for family members in the clinical setting. Comparison with relevant animal models is discussed.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

23653587,COL2A1 Mutation in Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia Algerian Type.,"Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Algerian type (SMD-A) is an autosomal dominant disorder that was first reported in an Algerian family by Kozlowski et al. [Pediatr Radiol 1988;18:221-226]. Kozlowski's group reported a sporadic case in a 12-year-old Polish boy. They proposed SMD-A as a distinctive skeletal dysplasia and also suggested that a case of SMD reported by Schmidt et al. [J Pediatr 1963;63:106-112] might have had the same disorder. Afterwards, however, no additional report has emerged to date. In addition, the question whether SMD-A belongs to type II collagenopathy (a group of disorders due to a heterozygous mutation of COL2A1) has been continuously under debate. Here we report a 7-year-old Japanese boy with a heterozygous missense mutation in COL2A1, 2582G>T (Gly861Val), whose phenotype matched that of SMD-A. Our observation supports the hypothesis that SMD-A is a variant of type II collagenopathy.",research-article; evaluation study; journal article
30728324,Hypomorphic mutations of TRIP11 cause odontochondrodysplasia.,"Odontochondrodysplasia (ODCD) is an unresolved genetic disorder of skeletal and dental development. Here, we show that ODCD is caused by hypomorphic TRIP11 mutations, and we identify ODCD as the nonlethal counterpart to achondrogenesis 1A (ACG1A), the known null phenotype in humans. TRIP11 encodes Golgi-associated microtubule-binding protein 210 (GMAP-210), an essential tether protein of the Golgi apparatus that physically interacts with intraflagellar transport 20 (IFT20), a component of the ciliary intraflagellar transport complex B. This association and extraskeletal disease manifestations in ODCD point to a cilium-dependent pathogenesis. However, our functional studies in patient-derived primary cells clearly support a Golgi-based disease mechanism. In spite of reduced abundance, residual GMAP variants maintain partial Golgi integrity, normal global protein secretion, and subcellular distribution of IFT20 in ODCD. These functions are lost when GMAP-210 is completely abrogated in ACG1A. However, a similar defect in chondrocyte maturation is observed in both disorders, which produces a cellular achondrogenesis phenotype of different severity, ensuing from aberrant glycan processing and impaired extracellular matrix proteoglycan secretion by the Golgi apparatus.",research-article; journal article

10080184,Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding noggin affect human joint morphogenesis.,"The secreted polypeptide noggin (encoded by the Nog gene) binds and inactivates members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of signalling proteins (TGFbeta-FMs), such as BMP4 (ref. 1). By diffusing through extracellular matrices more efficiently than TGFbeta-FMs, noggin may have a principal role in creating morphogenic gradients. During mouse embryogenesis, Nog is expressed at multiple sites, including developing bones. Nog-/- mice die at birth from multiple defects that include bony fusion of the appendicular skeleton. We have identified five dominant human NOG mutations in unrelated families segregating proximal symphalangism (SYM1; OMIM 185800) and a de novo mutation in a patient with unaffected parents. We also found a dominant NOG mutation in a family segregating multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS1; OMIM 186500); both SYM1 and SYNS1 have multiple joint fusion as their principal feature. All seven NOG mutations alter evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues. The findings reported here confirm that NOG is essential for joint formation and suggest that NOG requirements during skeletogenesis differ between species and between specific skeletal elements within species.",research-article; journal article
18417549,"Triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome and syndactyly type IV are caused by genomic duplications involving the long range, limb-specific SHH enhancer.","BACKGROUND: The Sonic hedgehog (SHH) protein produced in the zone of polarising activity (ZPA) is a major determinant of the identity and numbers of digits in early limb development. Preaxial polydactyly types II (PPD2) and III (PPD3) have been mapped to a critical region at 7q36, and subsequently shown to be caused by point mutations in the ZPA regulatory sequence (ZRS), a long range cis-regulator for the SHH gene. Triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome (TPTPS) and syndactyly type IV (SD4) were also mapped to the 7q36 region but pathogenic mutations in ZRS have not yet been affirmed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed linkage and haplotype analysis in six Han Chinese families with TPTPS and/or SD4, and refined the disease locus to an interval of 646 kb containing ZRS. In all families, the affected individuals heterozygous at rs10254391 (a single nucleotide polymorphism within ZRS) revealed a remarkable allele imbalance on sequence chromatogram. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we identified duplication of ZRS and found that this duplication segregated with the limb phenotypes in all families but was not detected in unaffected family members or in unrelated control individuals. The duplication was also confirmed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in an affected individual. We designed 17 additional qPCR assays and defined the minimum duplications in all six families, ranging from 131kb to 398kb. CONCLUSION: Both TPTPS and SD4 are due to duplications involving ZRS, the limb specific SHH enhancer. Point mutations in the ZRS and duplications encompassing the ZRS cause distinctive limb phenotypes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

12920067,Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: a questionnaire based study to delineate the different phenotypes caused by endoglin and ALK1 mutations.,"BACKGROUND:Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia characterised by mucocutaneous telangiectasis, epistaxis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and arteriovenous malformations in the lung and brain. Causative mutations for HHT have been identified in two genes, endoglin and ALK1, which encode proteins involved in serine-threonine kinase signalling in the endothelial cell. METHODS:A number of people affected with HHT had completed a postal questionnaire as part of an international study to delineate the HHT phenotype. We identified questionnaires completed by subjects in whom we had identified a mutation in endoglin or ALK1. Further questionnaires were sent to families with known mutations. Data were only included from questionnaires returned by people known to carry disease causing mutations. RESULTS:Questionnaires were completed by 83 subjects with known mutations. Of these, 49 had endoglin mutations (HHT1) and 34 had ALK1 mutations (HHT2). Subjects with HHT1 reported an earlier onset of epistaxis (p=0.01) and telangiectasis (p=0.0001) than those with HHT2. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations were only reported in the endoglin mutation group in our study (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:Our questionnaire based study provides evidence that the HHT phenotype caused by mutations in endoglin (HHT1) is distinct from, and more severe than, HHT caused by mutations in ALK1 (HHT2). This has significant implications for diagnosis, screening, and treatment in the two different forms of HHT, as well as for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease.","comparative study; research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

12073012,A loss-of-function mutation in the CFC domain of TDGF1 is associated with human forebrain defects.,"TDGF1 (CRIPTO) is an EGF-CFC family member and an obligate co-receptor involved in NODAL signaling, a developmental program implicated in midline, forebrain, and left-right axis development in model organisms. Previous studies of CFC1 (CRYPTIC), another member of the EGF-CFC family, demonstrated that normal function of this protein is required for proper laterality development in humans. Here we identify a mutation in the conserved CFC domain of TDGF1 in a patient with midline anomalies of the forebrain. The mutant protein is inactive in a zebrafish rescue assay, indicating a role for TDGF1 in human midline and forebrain development.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18065693,A nonsynonymous SNP in the ITGB3 gene disrupts the conserved membrane-proximal cytoplasmic salt bridge in the alphaIIbbeta3 integrin and cosegregates dominantly with abnormal proplatelet formation and macrothrombocytopenia.,"We report a 3-generation pedigree with 5 individuals affected with a dominantly inherited macrothrombocytopenia. All 5 carry 2 nonsynonymous mutations resulting in a D723H mutation in the beta3 integrin and a P53L mutation in glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha. We show that GPIbalpha-L53 is phenotypically silent, being also present in 3 unaffected pedigree members and in 7 of 1639 healthy controls. The beta3-H723 causes constitutive, albeit partial, activation of the alphaIIbbeta3 complex by disruption of the highly conserved cytoplasmic salt bridge with arginine 995 in the alphaIIb integrin as evidenced by increased PAC-1 but not fibrinogen binding to the patients' resting platelets. This was confirmed in CHO alphaIIbbeta3-H723 transfectants, which also exhibited increased PAC-1 binding, increased adhesion to von Willebrand factor (VWF) in static conditions and to fibrinogen under shear stress. Crucially, we show that in the presence of fibrinogen, alphaIIbbeta3-H723, but not wild-type alphaIIbbeta3, generates a signal that leads to the formation of proplatelet-like protrusions in transfected CHO cells. Abnormal proplatelet formation was confirmed in the propositus's CD34+ stem cell-derived megakaryocytes. We conclude that the constitutive activation of the alphaIIbbeta3-H723 receptor causes abnormal proplatelet formation, leading to incorrect sizing of platelets and the thrombocytopenia observed in the pedigree.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
23539728,SRGAP1 is a candidate gene for papillary thyroid carcinoma susceptibility.,"BACKGROUND:Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) shows high heritability, yet efforts to find predisposing genes have been largely negative. OBJECTIVES:The objective of this study was to identify susceptibility genes for PTC. METHODS:A genome-wide linkage analysis was performed in 38 families. Targeted association study and screening were performed in 2 large cohorts of PTC patients and controls. Candidate DNA variants were tested in functional studies. RESULTS:Linkage analysis and association studies identified the Slit-Robo Rho GTPase activating protein 1 gene (SRGAP1) in the linkage peak as a candidate gene. Two missense variants, Q149H and A275T, localized in the Fes/CIP4 homology domain segregated with the disease in 1 family each. One missense variant, R617C, located in the RhoGAP domain occurred in 1 family. Biochemical assays demonstrated that the ability to inactivate CDC42, a key function of SRGAP1, was severely impaired by the Q149H and R617C variants. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings suggest that SRGAP1 is a candidate gene in PTC susceptibility. SRGAP1 is likely a low-penetrant gene, possibly of a modifier type.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; multicenter study; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
1531728,Human tritanopia associated with two amino acid substitutions in the blue-sensitive opsin.,"Tritanopia is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of human vision characterize by a selective deficiency of blue spectral sensitivity. The defect is manifested within the retina and could be caused by a deficiency in function or numbers (or both) of blue-sensitive cone photoreceptors. We have used PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing of amplified exons to detect in four of nine unrelated tritanopic subjects two different point mutations in the gene encoding the blue-sensitive opsin, each leading to an amino acid substitution. Segregation analysis within pedigrees and hybridization of oligonucleotides specific for each allele to DNA samples from control subjects support the hypothesis that these mutations cause tritanopia. These results complete the genetic evidence for the trichromatic theory of human color vision.",journal article
10852420,High frequency of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis in women with tuberous sclerosis complex.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare cystic lung disorder that occurs almost exclusively in women of reproductive age, in women with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an inheritable multiorgan hamartomatosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the medical records of 78 women with definite TSC were reviewed, and pertinent information was recorded, including the demographic data, clinical manifestations, results of lung biopsies and autopsies, and findings on imaging studies of the chest and abdomen. All available computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 78 women with definite TSC seen from 1977 to 1998, 20 (26%) had evidence of LAM. Surgical lung biopsy or autopsy in 7 patients confirmed the diagnosis of their lung disease. Characteristic CT findings of LAM were noted in 13 additional patients. Twelve of these 20 patients with TSC-associated LAM had respiratory symptoms, including exertional shortness of breath and spontaneous pneumothorax, that eventually led to their pulmonary diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of lung involvement (LAM) in women with TSC is substantially higher than previously suspected and may be even higher than reported in this retrospective study. These findings support the recommendation for a screening CT of the chest for all women with TSC.",journal article
27866708,Mutations in Three Genes Encoding Proteins Involved in Hair Shaft Formation Cause Uncombable Hair Syndrome.,"Uncombable hair syndrome (UHS), also known as ""spun glass hair syndrome,"" ""pili trianguli et canaliculi,"" or ""cheveux incoiffables"" is a rare anomaly of the hair shaft that occurs in children and improves with age. UHS is characterized by dry, frizzy, spangly, and often fair hair that is resistant to being combed flat. Until now, both simplex and familial UHS-affected case subjects with autosomal-dominant as well as -recessive inheritance have been reported. However, none of these case subjects were linked to a molecular genetic cause. Here, we report the identification of UHS-causative mutations located in the three genes PADI3 (peptidylarginine deiminase 3), TGM3 (transglutaminase 3), and TCHH (trichohyalin) in a total of 11 children. All of these individuals carry homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in one of these three genes, indicating an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern in the majority of UHS case subjects. The two enzymes PADI3 and TGM3, responsible for posttranslational protein modifications, and their target structural protein TCHH are all involved in hair shaft formation. Elucidation of the molecular outcomes of the disease-causing mutations by cell culture experiments and tridimensional protein models demonstrated clear differences in the structural organization and activity of mutant and wild-type proteins. Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed morphological alterations in hair coat of Padi3 knockout mice. All together, these findings elucidate the molecular genetic causes of UHS and shed light on its pathophysiology and hair physiology in general.",research-article; journal article
31708116,CAKUT and Autonomic Dysfunction Caused by Acetylcholine Receptor Mutations.,"Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the most common cause of chronic kidney disease in the first three decades of life, and in utero obstruction to urine flow is a frequent cause of secondary upper urinary tract malformations. Here, using whole-exome sequencing, we identified three different biallelic mutations in CHRNA3, which encodes the α3 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, in five affected individuals from three unrelated families with functional lower urinary tract obstruction and secondary CAKUT. Four individuals from two families have additional dysautonomic features, including impaired pupillary light reflexes. Functional studies in vitro demonstrated that the mutant nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were unable to generate current following stimulation with acetylcholine. Moreover, the truncating mutations p.Thr337Asnfs∗81 and p.Ser340∗ led to impaired plasma membrane localization of CHRNA3. Although the importance of acetylcholine signaling in normal bladder function has been recognized, we demonstrate for the first time that mutations in CHRNA3 can cause bladder dysfunction, urinary tract malformations, and dysautonomia. These data point to a pathophysiologic sequence by which monogenic mutations in genes that regulate bladder innervation may secondarily cause CAKUT.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

25662009,Chromothriptic cure of WHIM syndrome.,"Chromothripsis is a catastrophic cellular event recently described in cancer in which chromosomes undergo massive deletion and rearrangement. Here, we report a case in which chromothripsis spontaneously cured a patient with WHIM syndrome, an autosomal dominant combined immunodeficiency disease caused by gain-of-function mutation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. In this patient, deletion of the disease allele, CXCR4(R334X), as well as 163 other genes from one copy of chromosome 2 occurred in a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) that repopulated the myeloid but not the lymphoid lineage. In competitive mouse bone marrow (BM) transplantation experiments, Cxcr4 haploinsufficiency was sufficient to confer a strong long-term engraftment advantage of donor BM over BM from either wild-type or WHIM syndrome model mice, suggesting a potential mechanism for the patient's cure. Our findings suggest that partial inactivation of CXCR4 may have general utility as a strategy to promote HSC engraftment in transplantation.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25256237,Genotype-phenotype relationships in Freeman-Sheldon syndrome.,"Distal arthrogryposis (DA) syndromes are a group of disorders characterized by multiple congenital contractures. DA type 2A (DA2A or Freeman-Sheldon syndrome), caused by mutations in MYH3, is typically considered the most severe of the DA syndromes. However, there is wide phenotypic variability among individuals with DA2A. We characterized genotype-phenotype relationships in 46 families with DA2A. MYH3 mutations were found in 43/46 (93%) kindreds, with three mutations (p.T178I, p.R672C, and p.R672H) explaining 39/43 (91%) of cases. Phenotypic severity varied significantly by genotype (P=0.0055). Individuals with p.T178I were the most severely affected with both facial contractures and congenital scoliosis. Classification of individuals with DA2A into phenotypic groups of varying severity should facilitate providing families with more accurate information about natural history and suggests that individuals might benefit from personalized medical management motivated by MYH3 genotype.","journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
16510655,Clinical characteristics and natural history of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE: Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS) is a rare, multiple congenital contracture syndrome that is nonetheless relatively well-known, because affected children have a striking appearance: it was historically called ""whistling-face syndrome"" because of involvement of the facial muscles. FSS is often confused with other congenital contracture syndromes and, as a result, the clinical characteristics and natural history are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to analyze the presentation, natural history, and outcome of a cohort of individuals ascertained using strict diagnostic criteria for FSS. METHODS: Data from questionnaires, medical charts, examination, and photographs were analyzed to describe the physical features, therapeutic interventions, and functional outcomes in 73 individuals referred with the diagnosis of FSS. RESULTS: Only 32 referred cases (approximately 40%) met diagnostic criteria for FSS. In addition to contractures, common features in these cases included severe scoliosis (85%), strabismus (42%), and hearing loss (30%). Most infants required supplementary feedings via a nasogastric (45%) or gastrostomy tube (17%). Children walked by an average age of 19 months, but approximately 80% required ambulation-assist devices. An average of approximately 10 surgeries was performed on each child, and anesthetic and/or surgical complications were reported in 50% of individuals. All individuals were cognitively normal. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics and natural history of FSS distinguish it from other forms of arthrogryposis, yet FSS is frequently misdiagnosed. Children with FSS require considerable nutritional, surgical, and rehabilitative intervention. Such intensive therapeutic demands differ substantially from most other congenital contracture syndromes. These findings underscore the necessity of making an accurate diagnosis.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
10945603,Renal failure in the Denys-Drash and Wilms' tumor-aniridia syndromes.,"Nearly 6000 patients enrolled in four clinical trials of the National Wilms' Tumor Study Group during 1969-1995 were followed until death or for a median of 11.0 years of survival for the onset of renal failure (RF). Thirteen of 22 patients with Denys-Drash syndrome and 10 of 46 patients with the Wilms' tumor aniridia syndrome developed RF. The cumulative risks of RF at 20 years from Wilms' tumor diagnosis were 62% and 38%, respectively. Only 21 cases of RF were observed among 5358 patients with unilateral disease who did not have characteristic congenital genitourinary anomalies, and their risk was <1%. Although other explanations cannot be completely excluded, the high rate of RF in patients with the aniridia syndrome challenges the view that nephropathy is associated uniquely with missense mutations in the WT1 gene. It suggests the possibility of a further gradation in the spectrum of phenotypes associated with different WT1 mutations. Patients with Wilms' tumor and aniridia or genitourinary abnormalities should be followed closely throughout life for signs of nephropathy or RF.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
20301362,Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is characterized by typical craniofacial features in infancy consisting of ""Greek warrior helmet"" appearance of the nose (wide bridge of the nose continuing to the forehead), microcephaly, high anterior hairline with prominent glabella, widely spaced eyes, epicanthus, highly arched eyebrows, short philtrum, downturned corners of the mouth, micrognathia, and poorly formed ears with pits/tags. All affected individuals have prenatal-onset growth deficiency followed by postnatal growth retardation and hypotonia with muscle underdevelopment. Developmental delay/intellectual disability of variable degree is present in all. Seizures occur in 90% to 100% of children with WHS. Other findings include skeletal anomalies (60%-70%), congenital heart defects (~50%), hearing loss (mostly conductive) (>40%), urinary tract malformations (25%), and structural brain abnormalities (33%). DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of WHS is established by the finding of a heterozygous deletion of the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region (WHSCR) on chromosome 4p16.3 by chromosomal microarray (CMA), conventional G-banded cytogenetic analysis, or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Treatment includes: rehabilitation, speech/communication therapy and sign language; valproic acid for atypical absence seizures; benzodiazepines for status epilepticus; special feeding techniques, gavage feeding, and/or gastrostomy for feeding difficulties. Standard care is recommended for skeletal anomalies, ophthalmologic abnormalities, congenital heart defects, hearing loss, sleep disturbance, and hepatic adenomas. Prevention of secondary complications: Antibiotic prophylaxis for vesicoureteral reflux; IVIG infusions or continuous antibiotics for those with antibody deficiencies. Surveillance: Systematic follow up to monitor rehabilitation and treatment as needed; annual complete blood count and renal function testing; consideration of routine liver ultrasounds. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Carbamazepine may worsen atypical absence seizures. GENETIC COUNSELING:WHS is caused by deletion of the WHSCR of chromosome 4p16.3 by one of several genetic mechanisms. About 50%-60% of individuals with WHS have a de novo pure deletion of 4p16 and about 40%-45% have an unbalanced translocation with both a deletion of 4p and a partial trisomy of a different chromosome arm. These unbalanced translocations may be de novo or inherited from a parent with a balanced rearrangement. The remaining have other complex rearrangements leading to a 4p16.3 deletion (e.g., ring 4). Risks to family members depend on the mechanism of origin of the deletion. Prenatal testing is possible for families in which one parent is known to be a carrier of a chromosome rearrangement involving 4p16.3.",book; review
24288038,Abetalipoproteinemia and homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia: a framework for diagnosis and management.,"Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL; OMIM 200100) and homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia (HHBL; OMIM 107730) are rare diseases characterized by hypocholesterolemia and malabsorption of lipid-soluble vitamins leading to retinal degeneration, neuropathy and coagulopathy. Hepatic steatosis is also common. The root cause of both disorders is improper packaging and secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoprotein particles due to mutations either in both alleles of the MTP (alias MTTP) gene encoding microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) or both alleles of the APOB gene itself in the case of ABL and HHBL, respectively. Clinical diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms, acanthocytosis on blood smear, and virtually absent apo B-containing lipoproteins, including chylomicrons, very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein. Obligate heterozygote parents of ABL patients usually have normal lipids consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, while heterozygous parents of HHBL patients typically have half normal levels of apo B-containing lipoproteins consistent with autosomal co-dominant inheritance. Definitive diagnosis involves sequencing the MTP and APOB genes, for which >30 and >60 mutations have been described for ABL and HHBL, respectively. Follow-up includes monitoring for ophthalmologic, neurologic, hematologic, and hepatic complications, as well as compliance with treatment. Investigations include lipid profile, serum transaminases, markers for lipid-soluble vitamins, and periodic instrumental assessment of ocular and neurological function. Mainstays of treatment include adherence to a low-fat diet, and supplementation with essential fatty acids and high oral doses of fat soluble vitamins. Prognosis is variable, but early diagnosis and strict adherence to treatment can recover normal neurological function and halt disease progression.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
11090342,"Acheiropodia is caused by a genomic deletion in C7orf2, the human orthologue of the Lmbr1 gene.","Acheiropodia is an autosomal recessive developmental disorder presenting with bilateral congenital amputations of the upper and lower extremities and aplasia of the hands and feet. This severely handicapping condition appears to affect only the extremities, with no other systemic manifestations reported. Recently, a locus for acheiropodia was mapped on chromosome 7q36. Herein we report the narrowing of the critical region for the acheiropodia gene and the subsequent identification of a common mutation in C7orf2-the human orthologue of the mouse Lmbr1 gene-that is responsible for the disease. Analysis of five families with acheiropodia, by means of 15 polymorphic markers, narrowed the critical region to 1.3 cM, on the basis of identity by descent, and to <0.5 Mb, on the basis of physical mapping. Analysis of C7orf2, the human orthologue of the mouse Lmbr1 gene, identified a deletion in all five families, thus identifying a common acheiropodia mutation. The deletion was identified at both the genomic-DNA and mRNA level. It leads to the production of a C7orf2 transcript lacking exon 4 and introduces a premature stop codon downstream of exon 3. Given the nature of the acheiropodia phenotype, it appears likely that the Lmbr1 gene plays an important role in limb development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Neurodevelopmental aspects include hypotonia of prenatal onset, seizures and moderate to severe mental retardation. The condition is probably of autosomal recessive inheritance but is closely resembles the Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder mapped to the short arm of chromosome seven. We reviewed the literature for aspects of associated cystic malformations in addition to agenesis of the corpus callosum and report on another patient with ACS. Prognosis is dependent on the degree of hypotonia and early onset of epilepsy rather than the degree of craniofacial and limb malformations.",journal article
17503333,RAB23 mutations in Carpenter syndrome imply an unexpected role for hedgehog signaling in cranial-suture development and obesity.,"Carpenter syndrome is a pleiotropic disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance, the cardinal features of which include craniosynostosis, polysyndactyly, obesity, and cardiac defects. Using homozygosity mapping, we found linkage to chromosome 6p12.1-q12 and, in 15 independent families, identified five different mutations (four truncating and one missense) in RAB23, which encodes a member of the RAB guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) family of vesicle transport proteins and acts as a negative regulator of hedgehog (HH) signaling. In 10 patients, the disease was caused by homozygosity for the same nonsense mutation, L145X, that resides on a common haplotype, indicative of a founder effect in patients of northern European descent. Surprisingly, nonsense mutations of Rab23 in open brain mice cause recessive embryonic lethality with neural-tube defects, suggesting a species difference in the requirement for RAB23 during early development. The discovery of RAB23 mutations in patients with Carpenter syndrome implicates HH signaling in cranial-suture biogenesis--an unexpected finding, given that craniosynostosis is not usually associated with mutations of other HH-pathway components--and provides a new molecular target for studies of obesity.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case-report"

14962902,Mutations in the ELA2 gene correlate with more severe expression of neutropenia: a study of 81 patients from the French Neutropenia Register.,"Heterozygous mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase (ELA2) have been associated with cyclic neutropenia (CN) and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). To date, 30 different mutations have been reported, but no correlation has been found with the degree of neutropenia. To address this issue, we analyzed the clinical, hematologic, and molecular characteristics of 81 unrelated patients with SCN (n = 54) or CN (n = 27). We identified mutations in 31 patients, two thirds of whom had sporadic forms. Familial cases were consistent with dominant inheritance. Seventeen novel mutations were identified, showing that the mutational spectrum encompasses not only the region encoding the mature enzyme but also the prodomains and promoter region. Genotype-phenotype analysis strongly suggested that ELA2 mutations correlate with more severe expression of neutropenia, specifically in patients diagnosed with SCN. This study underlines the importance of ELA2 molecular screening to identify patients who may be at particular risk of severe bacterial infections and/or acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplasia. By phenotypic analysis of affected relatives and carriers of the same ELA2 mutations, we showed that the expression of neutropenia in CN and SCN may be either homogeneous or variable according to the type of mutations, suggesting different pathogenetic mechanisms.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19036076,Homozygous HAX1 mutations in severe congenital neutropenia patients with sporadic disease: a novel mutation in two unrelated British kindreds.,"Patients with autosomal dominant (AD), sporadic and X-linked severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) may have mutations in the elastase 2 (ELA2) or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) genes. Homozygous mutations in the HAX1 gene have recently been reported in autosomal recessive (AR) cases of primarily Middle-Eastern descent and the original Kostmann family. We screened 109 predominantly Caucasian SCN kindreds for mutations in these genes; 33 (30%) had 24 different ELA2 mutations, five of them novel, two kindreds (2%) had WAS mutations and four kindreds (4%) had three different HAX1 mutations, two of them novel. One HAX1 mutation (p.Ser43LeufsX11) was found in an AR Ashkenazi Jewish kindred, the other (p.Glu31LysfsX54) in two unrelated British patients with sporadic disease. Microsatellite analysis of the HAX1 locus revealed a common haplotype (maximum distance 4.1 Megabases) for the p.Glu31LysfsX54 patients, suggesting a possible ancestral founder. In functional assays, the level of spontaneous and staurosporine-induced apoptosis was increased in neutrophils from both p.Ser43LeufsX11 patients but not a p.Glu31LysfsX54 patient, suggesting the possible presence of modifying factors. The low incidence of HAX1 mutations in our study suggests that the frequency may vary between racial groups but suggests that irrespective of inheritance or racial origin, SCN patients should be screened for HAX1 mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

12975300,Adult Alexander disease with autosomal dominant transmission: a distinct entity caused by mutation in the glial fibrillary acid protein gene.,"BACKGROUND: Infantile and juvenile forms of Alexander disease are well characterized and are caused by de novo mutations in the glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) gene. In contrast, the adult form of the disease has been rarely described, and the etiology of this variant remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical phenotype and identify the gene causing an autosomal dominant form of adult Alexander disease. METHODS: We identified a large kindred segregating clinical features compatible with adult Alexander disease in an autosomal dominant fashion. A neurological examination was performed on all affected members of this family. Most of these patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a polysomnographic study. The diagnosis was confirmed pathologically in 2 individuals. We screened all coding regions of the GFAP gene in affected individuals by means of direct sequencing and single-stranded conformational polymorphisms analysis. RESULTS: We found a novel D78E mutation in GFAP in all affected individuals. This mutation was not detected in more than 100 control subjects. Clinical and radiological features of affected individuals were clearly different from those of patients with the infantile and juvenile forms of the disease. The most consistent finding was the presence of bulbar signs. In addition, sleep disturbance (mainly sleep apnea), symptoms of dysautonomia, and dysmorphism were found in all affected individuals. In younger patients, magnetic resonance imaging showed T2 signal abnormalities in the medulla compatible with an area of demyelination. In contrast, in older patients, we found marked atrophy of the medulla without signal abnormalities. None of the affected individuals exhibit signs of demyelination of the cerebral white matter. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first demonstration of a mutation in GFAP that causes an autosomal dominant form of Alexander disease and establishes the existence of the adult variant. Clinical evaluation in individuals carrying mutation in the GFAP gene allowed a better definition of this heterogeneous clinical syndrome and will help increase its recognition in neurological practice.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

23729726,Iron refractory iron deficiency anemia.,"Iron refractory iron deficiency anemia is a hereditary recessive anemia due to a defect in the TMPRSS6 gene encoding Matriptase-2. This protein is a transmembrane serine protease that plays an essential role in down-regulating hepcidin, the key regulator of iron homeostasis. Hallmarks of this disease are microcytic hypochromic anemia, low transferrin saturation and normal/high serum hepcidin values. The anemia appears in the post-natal period, although in some cases it is only diagnosed in adulthood. The disease is refractory to oral iron treatment but shows a slow response to intravenous iron injections and partial correction of the anemia. To date, 40 different Matriptase-2 mutations have been reported, affecting all the functional domains of the large ectodomain of the protein. In vitro experiments on transfected cells suggest that Matriptase-2 cleaves Hemojuvelin, a major regulator of hepcidin expression and that this function is altered in this genetic form of anemia. In contrast to the low/undetectable hepcidin levels observed in acquired iron deficiency, in patients with Matriptase-2 deficiency, serum hepcidin is inappropriately high for the low iron status and accounts for the absent/delayed response to oral iron treatment. A challenge for the clinicians and pediatricians is the recognition of the disorder among iron deficiency and other microcytic anemias commonly found in pediatric patients. The current treatment of iron refractory iron deficiency anemia is based on parenteral iron administration; in the future, manipulation of the hepcidin pathway with the aim of suppressing it might become an alternative therapeutic approach.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article"
27666822,Destabilization of the IFT-B cilia core complex due to mutations in IFT81 causes a Spectrum of Short-Rib Polydactyly Syndrome.,"Short-rib polydactyly syndromes (SRPS) and Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD) or Jeune Syndrome are recessively inherited skeletal ciliopathies characterized by profound skeletal abnormalities and are frequently associated with polydactyly and multiorgan system involvement. SRPS are produced by mutations in genes that participate in the formation and function of primary cilia and usually result from disruption of retrograde intraflagellar (IFT) transport of the cilium. Herein we describe a new spectrum of SRPS caused by mutations in the gene IFT81, a key component of the IFT-B complex essential for anterograde transport. In mutant chondrocytes, the mutations led to low levels of IFT81 and mutant cells produced elongated cilia, had altered hedgehog signaling, had increased post-translation modification of tubulin, and showed evidence of destabilization of additional anterograde transport complex components.

Although autosomal-recessive inheritance of heterotaxy syndrome is seen in multiple families, underlying gene defects have remained unknown. Here we identify the molecular genetic basis of a kindred with five siblings with RAI. Linkage analysis and positional candidate gene approach showed that the affected children were compound heterozygotes for truncating mutations in the growth/differentiation factor 1 (GDF1) gene. Individuals heterozygous for the mutations were clinically healthy. This finding, supported by the similar phenotype in Gdf1 knockout mouse, provides firm evidence that RAI can occur as a recessively inherited condition, with GDF1 as the culprit gene. The results will shed light on the biological basis of human laterality defects and facilitate molecular diagnosis of RAI.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
28991257,"Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands.","Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality from birth defects. Here, exome sequencing of a single cohort of 2,871 CHD probands, including 2,645 parent-offspring trios, implicated rare inherited mutations in 1.8%, including a recessive founder mutation in GDF1 accounting for ∼5% of severe CHD in Ashkenazim, recessive genotypes in MYH6 accounting for ∼11% of Shone complex, and dominant FLT4 mutations accounting for 2.3% of Tetralogy of Fallot. De novo mutations (DNMs) accounted for 8% of cases, including ∼3% of isolated CHD patients and ∼28% with both neurodevelopmental and extra-cardiac congenital anomalies. Seven genes surpassed thresholds for genome-wide significance, and 12 genes not previously implicated in CHD had >70% probability of being disease related. DNMs in ∼440 genes were inferred to contribute to CHD. Striking overlap between genes with damaging DNMs in probands with CHD and autism was also found.",research-article; journal article
17924340,Loss-of-function mutations in growth differentiation factor-1 (GDF1) are associated with congenital heart defects in humans.,"Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans (incidence 8-10 per 1,000 live births). Although their etiology is often poorly understood, most are considered to arise from multifactorial influences, including environmental and genetic components, as well as from less common syndromic forms. We hypothesized that disturbances in left-right patterning could contribute to the pathogenesis of selected cardiac defects by interfering with the extrinsic cues leading to the proper looping and vessel remodeling of the normally asymmetrically developed heart and vessels. Here, we show that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the human GDF1 gene contribute to cardiac defects ranging from tetralogy of Fallot to transposition of the great arteries and that decreased TGF- beta signaling provides a framework for understanding their pathogenesis. These findings implicate perturbations of the TGF- beta signaling pathway in the causation of a major subclass of human CHDs.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
14506070,Cerebellar ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1: clinical and genetic studies.,"Ataxia with ocular motor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) is an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA) associated with oculomotor apraxia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypercholesterolaemia. The gene APTX, which encodes aprataxin, has been identified recently. We studied a large series of 158 families with non-Friedreich progressive ARCA. We identified 14 patients (nine families) with five different missense or truncating mutations in the aprataxin gene (W279X, A198V, D267G, W279R, IVS5+1), four of which were new. We determined the relative frequency of AOA1 which is 5%. Mutation carriers underwent detailed neurological, neuropsychological, electrophysiological, oculographic and biological examinations, as well as brain imaging. The mean age at onset was 6.8 +/- 4.8 years (range 2-18 years). Cerebellar ataxia with cerebellar atrophy on MRI and severe axonal sensorimotor neuropathy were present in all patients. In contrast, oculomotor apraxia (86%), hypoalbuminaemia (83%) and hypercholesterolaemia (75%) were variable. Choreic movements were frequent at onset (79%), but disappeared in the course of the disease in most cases. However, a remarkably severe and persistent choreic phenotype was associated with one of the mutations (A198V). Cognitive impairment was always present. Ocular saccade initiation was normal, but their duration was increased by the succession of multiple hypometric saccades that could clinically be confused with 'slow saccades'. We emphasize the phenotypic variability over the course of the disease. Cerebellar ataxia and/or chorea predominate at onset, but later on they are often partially masked by severe neuropathy, which is the most typical symptom in young adults. The presence of chorea, sensorimotor neuropathy, oculomotor anomalies, biological abnormalities, cerebellar atrophy on MRI and absence of the Babinski sign can help to distinguish AOA1 from Friedreich's ataxia on a clinical basis. The frequency of chorea at onset suggests that this diagnosis should also be considered in children with chorea who do not carry the IT15 mutation responsible for Huntington's disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
9039982,Bardet-Biedl syndrome: a molecular and phenotypic study of 18 families.,"The autosomal recessive disorder Bardet-Biedl syndrome is characterised by retinal degeneration, polydactyly, obesity, mental retardation, hypogenitalism, renal dysplasia, and short stature. It is heterogeneous with at least four gene loci (BBS1-4) having been mapped to date. We have studied 18 multiply affected families noting the presence of both major and minor manifestations. Using a fluorescently based PCR technique, we genotyped each family member and assigned linkage to one of the four loci. Given this degree of heterogeneity we hoped to find phenotypic differences between linkage categories. We found 44% of families linked to 11q13 (BBS1) and 17% linked to 16q21 (BBS2). Only one family was linked to 15q22 (BBS4) and none to 3p12. We conclude that BBS1 is the major locus among white Bardet-Biedl patients and that BBS3 is extremely rare. Only subtle phenotypic differences were observed, the most striking of which was a finding of taller affected offspring compared with their parents in the BBS1 category. Affected subjects in the BBS2 and 4 groups were significantly shorter than their parents. Twenty eight percent of pedigrees did not show linkage to any known locus, evidence for at least a fifth gene. We conclude that the different genes responsible for Bardet-Biedl syndrome may influence growth characteristics such as height.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

7815885,Familial disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection in childhood: a human mycobacterial susceptibility gene?,"Inherited defects in specific components of the immune system have provided many clues to the immunological mechanisms underlying resistance to microbial infection. We report a familial immune defect predisposing to disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection in childhood. 6 children with disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection and no recognised form of immunodeficency were identified. Four, including two brothers, come from a village in Malta, and two are brothers of Greek Cypriot origin. They presented with fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. They had anaemia and an acute phase response. A range of different mycobacteria (Mycobacterium fortuitum, M chelonei, and four strains of M avium intracellulare complex) were isolated. Treatment with multiple antibiotics failed to eradicate the infection, although treatment with gamma interferon was associated with improvement. Three have died and the surviving children have chronic infection. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha production in response to endotoxin and gamma-interferon was found to be defective in affected patients and their parents. T-cell proliferative responses to mycobacterial and recall antigens were reduced in parents of affected children and gamma-interferon production was diminished in the affected patients and their parents. Clinical and immunological features suggest that these patients are phenotypically similar to Lsh/Ity/Bcg susceptible mice. Understanding of this defect may provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for susceptibility to mycobacteria.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

24131138,Deep dermatophytosis and inherited CARD9 deficiency.,"Deep dermatophytosis is a severe and sometimes life-threatening fungal infection caused by dermatophytes. It is characterized by extensive dermal and subcutaneous tissue invasion and by frequent dissemination to the lymph nodes and, occasionally, the central nervous system. The condition is different from common superficial dermatophyte infection and has been reported in patients with no known immunodeficiency. Patients are mostly from North African, consanguineous, multiplex families, which strongly suggests a mendelian genetic cause.We studied the clinical features of deep dermatophytosis in 17 patients with no known immunodeficiency from eight unrelated Tunisian, Algerian, and Moroccan families. Because CARD9 (caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9) deficiency has been reported in an Iranian family with invasive fungal infections, we also sequenced CARD9 in the patients.Four patients died, at 28, 29, 37, and 39 years of age, with clinically active deep dermatophytosis. No other severe infections, fungal or otherwise, were reported in the surviving patients, who ranged in age from 37 to 75 years. The 15 Algerian and Tunisian patients, from seven unrelated families, had a homozygous Q289X CARD9 allele, due to a founder effect. The 2 Moroccan siblings were homozygous for the R101C CARD9 allele. Both alleles are rare deleterious variants. The familial segregation of these alleles was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance and complete clinical penetrance.All the patients with deep dermatophytosis had autosomal recessive CARD9 deficiency. Deep dermatophytosis appears to be an important clinical manifestation of CARD9 deficiency.

10775536,Clinical and molecular genetic characteristics of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme 27-sterol hydroxylase (CYP 27), due to mutations in its gene. In this study we report on mutations in 58 patients with CTX out of 32 unrelated families. Eight of these were novel mutations, two of which were found together with two already known pathogenic mutations. Twelve mutations found in this patient group have been described in the literature. In the patients from 31 families, mutations were found in both alleles. In the literature, 28 mutations in 67 patients with CTX out of 44 families have been described. Pooling our patient group and the patients from the literature together, 37 different mutations in 125 patients out of 74 families were obtained. Identical mutations have been found in families from different ethnic backgrounds. In 41% of all the patients, CYP 27 gene mutations are found in the region of exons 6-8. This region encodes for adrenodoxin and haem binding sites of the protein. Of these 125 patients, a genotype-phenotype analysis was done for 79 homozygous patients harbouring 23 different mutations, out of 45 families. The patients with compound heterozygous mutations were left out of the genotype-phenotype analysis. The genotype-phenotype analysis did not reveal any correlation.",journal article

To gain more insight into the type and frequency of ophthalmological alterations in this multisystem metabolic disorder, we examined 13 CTX patients. Besides cataracts, found in all cases, the second most frequent ocular abnormality was paleness of the optic disk, which was found in 6 patients and was probably previously underestimated. Signs of premature retinal senescence were also observed. We discuss the possible relation between these ocular manifestations and the metabolic defect.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16400610,Spectrum of CHD7 mutations in 110 individuals with CHARGE syndrome and genotype-phenotype correlation.,"CHARGE syndrome is a well-established multiple-malformation syndrome with distinctive consensus diagnostic criteria. Characteristic associated anomalies include ocular coloboma, choanal atresia, cranial nerve defects, distinctive external and inner ear abnormalities, hearing loss, cardiovascular malformations, urogenital anomalies, and growth retardation. Recently, mutations of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein gene CHD7 were reported to be a major cause of CHARGE syndrome. We sequenced the CHD7 gene in 110 individuals who had received the clinical diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome, and we detected mutations in 64 (58%). Mutations were distributed throughout the coding exons and conserved splice sites of CHD7. Of the 64 mutations, 47 (73%) predicted premature truncation of the protein. These included nonsense and frameshift mutations, which most likely lead to haploinsufficiency. Phenotypically, the mutation-positive group was more likely to exhibit cardiovascular malformations (54 of 59 in the mutation-positive group vs. 30 of 42 in the mutation-negative group; P=.014), coloboma of the eye (55 of 62 in the mutation-positive group vs. 30 of 43 in the mutation-negative group; P=.022), and facial asymmetry, often caused by seventh cranial nerve abnormalities (36 of 56 in the mutation-positive group vs. 13 of 39 in the mutation-negative group; P=.004). Mouse embryo whole-mount and section in situ hybridization showed the expression of Chd7 in the outflow tract of the heart, optic vesicle, facio-acoustic preganglion complex, brain, olfactory pit, and mandibular component of the first branchial arch. Microarray gene-expression analysis showed a signature pattern of gene-expression differences that distinguished the individuals with CHARGE syndrome with CHD7 mutation from the controls. We conclude that cardiovascular malformations, coloboma, and facial asymmetry are common findings in CHARGE syndrome caused by CHD7 mutation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

9556299,CHARGE syndrome: report of 47 cases and review.,"The acronym CHARGE refers to a syndrome of unknown cause. Here we report on 47 CHARGE patients evaluated for the frequency of major anomalies, namely coloboma (79%), heart malformation (85%), choanal atresia (57%), growth and/or mental retardation (100%), genital anomalies (34%), ear anomalies (91%), and/or deafness (62%). In addition, we comment on anomalies observed very frequently in neonates and infants with the CHARGE syndrome, including, minor facial anomalies, neonatal brain stem dysfunction with cranial nerve palsy, and, mostly, internal ear anomalies such as semicircular canal hypoplasia that were found in each patient that could be tested. We propose several criteria for poor survival including male gender, central nervous system and/or oesophageal malformations, and bilateral choanal atresia. No predictive factor regarding developmental prognosis could be identified in our series. A significantly higher mean paternal age at conception together with concordance in monozygotic twins and the existence of rare familial cases support the role of genetic factors such as de novo mutation of a dominant gene or subtle sub-microscopic chromosome rearrangement. Finally, the combination of malformations in CHARGE syndrome strongly supports the view that this multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome is a polytopic developmental field defect involving the neural tube and the neural crests cells.",review; journal article; case reports

We found elevated levels of cholesta-8,14-dien-3beta-ol in cultured skin fibroblasts of an 18-wk-old fetus with HEM, compatible with a deficiency of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme 3beta-hydroxysterol delta(14)-reductase. Sequence analysis of two candidate genes encoding putative human sterol delta(14)-reductases (TM7SF2 and LBR) identified a homozygous 1599-1605TCTTCTA-->CTAGAAG substitution in exon 13 of the LBR gene encoding the lamin B receptor, which results in a truncated protein. Functional complementation of the HEM cells by transfection with control LBR cDNA confirmed that LBR encoded the defective sterol delta(14)-reductase. Mutations in LBR recently have been reported also to cause Pelger-Huët anomaly, an autosomal dominant trait characterized by hypolobulated nuclei and abnormal chromatin structure in granulocytes. The fact that the healthy mother of the fetus showed hypolobulated nuclei in 60% of her granulocytes confirms that classic Pelger-Huët anomaly represents the heterozygous state of 3beta-hydroxysterol delta(14)-reductase deficiency.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case-report"

24355708,PNPLA6 mutations cause Boucher-Neuhauser and Gordon Holmes syndromes as part of a broad neurodegenerative spectrum.,"Boucher-Neuhäuser and Gordon Holmes syndromes are clinical syndromes defined by early-onset ataxia and hypogonadism plus chorioretinal dystrophy (Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome) or brisk reflexes (Gordon Holmes syndrome). Here we uncover the genetic basis of these two syndromes, demonstrating that both clinically distinct entities are allelic for recessive mutations in the gene PNPLA6. In five of seven Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome/Gordon Holmes syndrome families, we identified nine rare conserved and damaging mutations by applying whole exome sequencing. Further, by dissecting the complex clinical presentation of Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome and Gordon Holmes syndrome into its neurological system components, we set out to analyse an additional 538 exomes from families with ataxia (with and without hypogonadism), pure and complex hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2. We identified four additional PNPLA6 mutations in spastic ataxia and hereditary spastic paraplegia families, revealing that Boucher-Neuhäuser and Gordon Holmes syndromes in fact represent phenotypic clusters on a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases caused by mutations in PNPLA6. Structural analysis indicates that the majority of mutations falls in the C-terminal phospholipid esterase domain and likely inhibits the catalytic activity of PNPLA6, which provides the precursor for biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Our findings show that PNPLA6 influences a manifold of neuronal systems, from the retina to the cerebellum, upper and lower motor neurons and the neuroendocrine system, with damage of this protein causing an extraordinarily broad continuous spectrum of associated neurodegenerative disease.",review-article; review; journal article
25299038,PNPLA6-Related Disorders,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:PNPLA6-related disorders span a phenotypic continuum characterized by variable combinations of cerebellar ataxia, upper motor neuron involvement manifesting as spasticity and/or brisk reflexes, chorioretinal dystrophy associated with variable degrees of reduced visual function, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (delayed puberty and lack of secondary sex characteristics), either in isolation or as part of anterior hypopituitarism (growth hormone, thyroid hormone, or gonadotropin deficiencies). Common but less frequent features are peripheral neuropathy (usually of axonal type manifesting as reduced distal reflexes, diminished vibratory sensation, and/or distal muscle wasting), hair anomalies (long eyelashes, bushy eyebrows, or scalp alopecia), short stature, and impaired cognitive functioning (learning disabilities in children and deficits in attention, visuospatial abilities, and recall in adults). Some of these features can occur in distinct clusters on the phenotypic continuum: Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome (cerebellar ataxia, chorioretinal dystrophy, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism); Gordon Holmes syndrome (cerebellar ataxia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and – to a variable degree – brisk reflexes); Oliver-McFarlane syndrome (trichomegaly, chorioretinal dystrophy, short stature, intellectual disability, and hypopituitarism); Laurence-Moon syndrome; and spastic paraplegia type 39 (SPG39) (upper motor neuron involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and sometimes reduced cognitive functioning and/or cerebellar ataxia). DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of a PNPLA6-related disorder is suspected on clinical and neuroimaging findings and confirmed by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in PNPLA6. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Management is symptomatic and individually tailored. Ataxia: continuous training of speech and swallowing, fine-motor skills, gait, and balance. Spasticity: interventions to improving strength and agility such as exercises, assistive walking devices and/or ankle-foot orthotics, drugs to reduce muscle spasticity. Chorioretinal dystrophy: low vision aids when central acuity is reduced; involvement with agencies for the visually impaired re vocational training, mobility training, and skills for independent living. Hypothyroidism: hormone replacement therapy as soon as identified. Growth hormone deficiency: hormone replacement therapy during childhood and/or adolescence as indicated. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: hormone replacement therapy at the expected time of puberty. Prevention of secondary complications: A daily regimen of physical therapy to maintain and improve coordination, muscle strength, and gait; to reduce spasticity; and to prevent contractures. Surveillance: Periodic evaluations (annually or as needed) by a neurologist, ophthalmologist and (if necessary) an endocrinologist to assess progression and develop treatment strategies. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Alcohol; obesity; inactive, sedentary lifestyle; exposure to medications or chemicals that exacerbate neuropathy. GENETIC COUNSELING:PNPLA6-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the PNPLA6 pathogenic variants in the family have been identified.",book; review

Seventeen (59%) of 29 serum samples drawn from patients with alcoholic cirrhosis contained 1,2-propanediol in concentrations above 5 nmol/ml (range less than 5.0 nmol/ml-35.4 nmol/ml, median 5.6), 8 (28%) of 29 samples contained D,L-2,3-butanediol in concentrations above 5.0 nmol/ml (range less than 5.0 nmol/ml-211 nmol/ml) and 7 (25%) of 29 samples contained meso-2,3-butanediol in concentrations above 5.0 nmol/ml (range less than 5.0-63.4 nmol/ml). In alcohol abstinent patients with alcoholic cirrhosis elevated serum 2,3-butanediol is due neither to ingestion of diols from undistilled alcoholic beverages nor is it likely to arise directly from the metabolic products of ethanol. In future studies on the origin of 2,3-butanediol in alcoholic patients biopsy evidence of the degree of associated liver damage should be obtained.",meeting-report; meeting report
16865293,Cockayne syndrome type A: novel mutations in eight typical patients.,"Cockayne syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. It is considered to be a heterogeneous condition based on complementation in cell fusion studies, with two major forms, namely CS-A and CS-B. CKN1 is the gene responsible for CS-A, whose mutations disrupt the transcription-coupled repair system of the actively transcribed DNA. Mutation analysis of the CKN1 gene in eight typical CS-A Brazilian patients from six families showed a gene alteration in all of them. We found a total of five novel mutations that were absent from healthy control subjects. Six affected subjects were simple homozygotes and two affected siblings were each compound heterozygotes. While the findings extend the range of mutations in CS-A, there is no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation across the mutational spectrum.",journal article
12446373,The ophthalmic findings in Cohen syndrome.,"AIM:Cohen syndrome is an uncommon autosomal recessive condition comprising a characteristic facial appearance, mental retardation, benign neutropenia, and retinal dystrophy. This study aimed to identify patients with Cohen syndrome from across the United Kingdom in order to define the variability of ophthalmic manifestations. METHODS:Ophthalmic assessment was undertaken and past ophthalmic records reviewed in 22 patients with classic features of Cohen syndrome. RESULTS:All patients had visual problems which commonly started in the preschool years. 82% developed strabismus or refractive error during the first 5 years of life. 70% developed high myopia by the second decade. By contrast with the findings of others, early onset retinal dystrophy was common, occurring in 80% of study patients under age 5 years. 35% of patients were registered partially sighted or blind. CONCLUSION:The ophthalmic abnormalities associated with Cohen syndrome, including high myopia and a generalised, severe retinal dystrophy, are of early onset and frequently result in severe visual handicap. Cohen syndrome should be considered in the young, developmentally delayed child who presents with severe myopia and nyctalopia.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
24412933,Mutation of SALL2 causes recessive ocular coloboma in humans and mice.,"Ocular coloboma is a congenital defect resulting from failure of normal closure of the optic fissure during embryonic eye development. This birth defect causes childhood blindness worldwide, yet the genetic etiology is poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel homozygous mutation in the SALL2 gene in members of a consanguineous family affected with non-syndromic ocular coloboma variably affecting the iris and retina. This mutation, c.85G>T, introduces a premature termination codon (p.Glu29*) predicted to truncate the SALL2 protein so that it lacks three clusters of zinc-finger motifs that are essential for DNA-binding activity. This discovery identifies SALL2 as the third member of the Drosophila homeotic Spalt-like family of developmental transcription factor genes implicated in human disease. SALL2 is expressed in the developing human retina at the time of, and subsequent to, optic fissure closure. Analysis of Sall2-deficient mouse embryos revealed delayed apposition of the optic fissure margins and the persistence of an anterior retinal coloboma phenotype after birth. Sall2-deficient embryos displayed correct posterior closure toward the optic nerve head, and upon contact of the fissure margins, dissolution of the basal lamina occurred and PAX2, known to be critical for this process, was expressed normally. Anterior closure was disrupted with the fissure margins failing to meet, or in some cases misaligning leading to a retinal lesion. These observations demonstrate, for the first time, a role for SALL2 in eye morphogenesis and that loss of function of the gene causes ocular coloboma in humans and mice.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

We have observed a Moroccan sibship where four girls and one boy were affected with this rare syndrome. The parents were first cousins once removed and unaffected. Genome wide homozygosity mapping using 386 microsatellite markers linked the locus to 20p13. A maximum multipoint lod score of 4.20 was obtained at marker D20S179. The minimal critical region is 7.73 cM between markers D20S199 and D20S437.

CDPD and autosomal recessive, non-syndromic congenital hereditary endothelial corneal dystrophy (CHED2) both map at overlapping loci at 20p13, and mutations of SLC4A11 were reported recently in CHED2. A genotype study on six families with CDPD and on one family with either CHED or CDPD, from various ethnic backgrounds (in the seventh family, hearing loss could not be assessed because of the proband's young age), is reported here. Novel SLC4A11 mutations were found in all patients. Why some mutations cause hearing loss in addition to corneal dystrophy is presently unclear. These findings extend the implication of the SLC4A11 borate transporter beyond corneal dystrophy to perceptive deafness.",journal article; case-report

16603246,Nephropathic cystinosis: posterior segment manifestations and effects of cysteamine therapy.,"PURPOSE: Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the intracellular accumulation of cystine. Treatment involves intracellular cystine depletion with oral cysteamine. A wide spectrum of ocular pathologic features has been associated with nephropathic cystinosis. We used the largest documented cohort of patients in the world to study the posterior segment manifestations associated with infantile nephropathic cystinosis and to determine retrospectively the effect of chronic oral cysteamine therapy on the frequency of these abnormalities. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of a series of patients. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eight patients with infantile nephropathic cystinosis were studied at the National Institutes of Health between 1976 and 2004. METHODS: All patients underwent an ophthalmic evaluation. Patients older than 11 years also underwent Humphrey static perimetry, and electrophysiological testing was performed when possible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, retina findings, visual fields, and electroretinographic (ERG) findings. RESULTS: Pigmentary changes with retinal pigment epithelial mottling, seen as early as infancy, were the most common posterior segment manifestations. Moderate to severe constriction of the visual fields, as well as moderate to severe reduction of rod- and cone-mediated ERG responses, was seen in older patients. The frequency of retinopathy correlated directly with time not receiving oral cysteamine therapy and inversely with time receiving oral cysteamine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Infantile nephropathic cystinosis has posterior segment complications that can contribute to significant visual handicap. Early initiation of oral cysteamine therapy can reduce the frequency of posterior segment complications in cystinosis patients.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; journal article"
2381441,Swallowing dysfunction in nephropathic cystinosis.,"BACKGROUND: Nephropathic cystinosis causes renal failure in most patients at approximately 10 years of age. This can be prevented or retarded by cystine-depleting therapy with oral cysteamine. Many patients who do not receive adequate cysteamine therapy undergo renal transplantation, but the accumulation of cystine continues in other organs, resulting in various clinical abnormalities. We report age-related swallowing dysfunction in patients with nephropathic cystinosis. METHODS: We studied 43 patients with cystinosis (24 who had received a renal transplant and 19 who had not), 3 to 31 years of age. Oral motor function was assessed by a cranial-nerve oral sensorimotor examination, and an oral motor index was calculated for each patient. The oral phase of swallowing was assessed by ultrasonography, and the pharyngeal and esophageal phases were evaluated by videofluoroscopy. RESULTS: Approximately half the patients were slow eaters. Oral motor dysfunction, reflected by a higher oral motor index, increased with age. Speech, oral structure and anatomy, and tongue and lip strength were particularly affected. Seven of nine patients 21 to 31 years old had abnormalities in all three phases of swallowing; the deficits were variable in younger patients. In 28 patients with cystinosis, the mean (+/- SD) duration of oropharyngeal swallowing for a dry swallow (3.06 +/- 1.06 seconds) was longer than in 14 normal subjects (1.89 +/- 0.57 seconds; P less than 0.001). This prolongation reflected impairment of the initiation phase of swallowing. CONCLUSIONS: Swallowing dysfunction is a late complication of nephropathic cystinosis, probably related to muscular dysfunction. Changes in the consistency of foods, swallowing exercises, and long-term cysteamine therapy should be considered for patients with cystinosis who have difficulty in swallowing.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

9357814,"A kinetic mass balance model for 1,5-anhydroglucitol: applications to monitoring of glycemic control.","The polyol 1,5-anhydroglucitol (AG) present in human plasma is derived largely from ingestion and is excreted unmetabolized. Reduction of plasma [AG] has been noted in diabetics and is due to accelerated excretion of AG during hyperglycemia. Plasma [AG] has therefore been proposed as a marker for glycemic control. A precise understanding of its utility relies on a quantitative understanding of the mass balance for AG. In this study, non-steady-state data from the literature were analyzed to develop a dynamic mass balance model for AG that is based on the two-compartment model proposed by Yamanouchi et al. [T. Yamanouchi, Y. Tachibana, H. Akanuma, S. Minoda, T. Shinohara, H. Moromizato, H. Miyashita, and I. Akaoka. Am. J. Physiol. 263 (Endocrinol. Metab. 26): E268-E273, 1992]. The data are consistent with a model in which exchange between tissue and plasma pools is rapid and in which the tissue compartment mass is two to three times the mass of the plasma compartment. According to model estimates, accelerated excretion of AG due to hyperglycemia can cause marked net depletion of total AG over a time scale of days. Recovery from a depleted state is slow because the total body capacity represents >5 wk of normal intake. Accordingly, AG monitoring should be able to indicate the presence of past glucosuric hyperglycemic episodes during a period of days to weeks, as well as provide information on the extent to which high deviations from the average plasma glucose concentration are operative.",journal article

28292286,Exome sequencing identifies a novel TTC37 mutation in the first reported case of Trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THE-S) in South Africa.,"Trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THE-S) or phenotypic diarrhoea of infancy is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by severe infantile diarrhoea, facial dysmorphism, immunodeficiency and woolly hair. It was first described in 1982 in two infants with intractable diarrhoea, liver cirrhosis and abnormal hair structure on microscopy. We report on two siblings from a consanguineous family of Somali descent who, despite extensive clinical investigation, remained undiagnosed until their demise. The index patient died of fulminant cytomegalovirus pneumonitis at 3 months of age.Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on a premortem DNA sample from the index case. Variants in a homozygous recessive state or compound heterozygous state were prioritized as potential candidate variants using TAPER™. Sanger sequencing was done to genotype the parents, unaffected sibling and a deceased sibling for the variant of interest.Exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.4507C > T, rs200067423) in TTC37 which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the index case. The identification of this mutation led to the diagnosis of THE-S in the proband and the same homozygous variant was confirmed in a male sibling who died 4 years earlier with severe chronic diarrhoea of infancy. The unaffected parents and sister were heterozygous for the identified variant.WES permitted definitive genetic diagnosis despite an atypical presentation in the index case and suggests that severe infection, likely secondary to immunodeficiency, may be a presenting feature. In addition definitive molecular diagnosis allows for genetic counseling and future prenatal diagnosis, and demonstrates the value of WES for post-mortem diagnosis of disorders with a non-specific clinical presentation in which a Mendelian cause is suspected.",research-article; journal article; case reports
21123949,Loss-of-function mutations in the glutamate transporter SLC1A1 cause human dicarboxylic aminoaciduria.,"Solute carrier family 1, member 1 (SLC1A1; also known as EAAT3 and EAAC1) is the major epithelial transporter of glutamate and aspartate in the kidneys and intestines of rodents. Within the brain, SLC1A1 serves as the predominant neuronal glutamate transporter and buffers the synaptic release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate within the interneuronal synaptic cleft. Recent studies have also revealed that polymorphisms in SLC1A1 are associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in early-onset patient cohorts. Here we report that SLC1A1 mutations leading to substitution of arginine to tryptophan at position 445 (R445W) and deletion of isoleucine at position 395 (I395del) cause human dicarboxylic aminoaciduria, an autosomal recessive disorder of urinary glutamate and aspartate transport that can be associated with mental retardation. These mutations of conserved residues impeded or abrogated glutamate and cysteine transport by SLC1A1 and led to near-absent surface expression in a canine kidney cell line. These findings provide evidence that SLC1A1 is the major renal transporter of glutamate and aspartate in humans and implicate SLC1A1 in the pathogenesis of some neurological disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; in vitro; journal article"
11788828,Identification of a variant associated with adult-type hypolactasia.,"Adult-type hypolactasia, also known as lactase non-persistence (lactose intolerance), is a common autosomal recessive condition resulting from the physiological decline in activity of the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) in intestinal cells after weaning. LPH hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose. Sequence analyses of the coding and promoter regions of LCT, the gene encoding LPH, has revealed no DNA variations correlating with lactase non-persistence. An associated haplotype spanning LCT, as well as a distinct difference in the transcript levels of 'non-persistence' and 'persistence' alleles in heterozygotes, suggest that a cis-acting element contributes to the lactase non-persistence phenotype. Using linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis of nine extended Finnish families, we restricted the locus to a 47-kb interval on 2q21. Sequence analysis of the complete region and subsequent association analyses revealed that a DNA variant, C/T-13910, roughly 14 kb upstream from the LCT locus, completely associates with biochemically verified lactase non-persistence in Finnish families and a sample set of 236 individuals from four different populations. A second variant, G/A-22018, 8 kb telomeric to C/T-13910, is also associated with the trait in 229 of 236 cases. Prevalence of the C/T-13910 variant in 1,047 DNA samples is consistent with the reported prevalence of adult-type hypolactasia in four different populations. That the variant (C/T-13910) occurs in distantly related populations indicates that it is very old.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

It is characterized by the association of progressive spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD), microcephaly, mental retardation (MR), and coarse facies. The radiographic appearance of generalized platyspondyly with double-humped end plates and the lace-like appearance of iliac crests are pathognomonic and distinctive of DMC syndrome. The disorder results from mutations in the DYM gene mapped in the 18q12-12.1 chromosomal region.In this report, we studied 15 Egyptian cases with DMC syndrome from nine unrelated families. We aimed to emphasize the characteristic clinical and radiological features in order to differentiate the condition from other SEMDs and mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). Patients were subjected to detailed history taking, three-generation family pedigree analysis, complete physical examination, anthropometric measurements, quantitative estimation, and two-dimensional electrophoresis of glycosaminoglycans in the urine and measurement of Î±-l-iduronidase and galactose-6-sulfatase enzyme activities to exclude Hurler and Morquio diseases (MPS type I and MPS type IVA), respectively. Other investigations were carried out whenever indicated. All patients were the offspring of consanguineous apparently normal parents. Positive family history and similarly affected sibs were noted, confirming the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of the syndrome. Short stature, microcephaly, variable degree of MR, and coarse facies were constant features. The frequency of characteristic orthopedic and radiological findings was reported. Orthopedic surgical intervention was carried out for two patients.The study concluded that DMC syndrome may be more frequent in Egypt than previously thought, especially due to misdiagnosis. Characteristic facial dysmorphism, body habitus, and pathognomonic radiological signs suggest the diagnosis and differentiate it from other types of SEMDs and MPS for proper genetic counseling and management.",research-article; journal article

However, patients with DMC exhibit significant developmental delay and mental retardation, the major features that distinguish the two conditions. Linkage studies localized the SMC and DMC disease genes to chromosome 18q12-21.1, providing evidence suggesting that they are allelic disorders. Sequence analysis of the coding exons of the FLJ90130 gene, a highly evolutionarily conserved gene within the recombination interval defined in the linkage study, identified mutations in SMC and DMC patients. The affected individuals in two consanguinous DMC families were homozygous for a stop codon mutation and a frameshift mutation, respectively, demonstrating that DMC represents the FLJ90130-null phenotype. The data confirm the hypothesis that SMC and DMC are allelic disorders and identify a gene necessary for normal skeletal development and brain function.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research-article; journal article"

We studied a large consanguineous kindred afflicted with autosomal recessive SHFM. Twelve affected members had central feet reductions with or without hand involvement while the remaining one had the mildest phenotype and atypical SHFM. We identified by homozygosity mapping a novel SHFM locus at 12q13.11-q13 with a maximum multipoint lod score of 5.47 and by subsequent candidate gene approach a homozygous missense WNT10b mutation (p.R332W) in all affected individuals but the atypical case plus in an asymptomatic female. We propose that either a second locus contributes to the manifestation of SHFM phenotype or a suppressor locus prevented trait manifestation in the non-penetrant female. We also investigated linkage to the five known SHFM loci. Four of the loci were excluded, while in TP63 [tumor protein p63 (SHFM4)], the only known gene responsible for SHFM, we detected in most affected subjects a rare insertion variant (rs34201045) at the alternate promoter used for transcription of the N-terminal-truncated p63 isotype.

We have amplified FACC exons with their flanking intron sequences from genomic DNA from 174 racially and ethnically diverse families in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry and have screened for mutations by using SSCP analysis. We identified eight different variants in 32 families; three were detected in exon 1, one in exon 4, one in intron 4, two in exon 6, and one in exon 14. Two of the eight variants, in seven families, did not segregate with the disease allele in multiplex families, suggesting that these variants represented benign polymorphisms. Disease-associated mutations in FACC were detected in a total of 25 (14.4%) of 174 families screened. The most frequent mutations were IVS4 + 4 A-->T (intron 4; 12 families) and 322delG (exon 1; 9 families).

29904161,From exome analysis in idiopathic azoospermia to the identification of a high-risk subgroup for occult Fanconi anemia.,"PURPOSE:In about 10% of patients affected by Fanconi anemia (FA) the diagnosis is delayed until adulthood, and the presenting symptom in these ""occult"" FA cases is often a solid cancer and cancer treatment-related toxicity. Highly predictive clinical parameter(s) for diagnosing such an adult-onset cases are missing. METHODS:(1) Exome sequencing (ES), (2) Sanger sequencing of FANCA, (3) diepoxybutane (DEB)-induced chromosome breakage test. RESULTS:ES identified a pathogenic homozygous FANCA variant in a patient affected by Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS) and in his azoospermic brother. Although they had no overt anemia, chromosomal breakage test revealed a reverse somatic mosaicism in the former and a typical FA picture in the latter. In 27 selected SCOS cases, 1 additional patient showing compound heterozygous pathogenic FANCA variants was identified with positive chromosomal breakage test. CONCLUSION:We report an extraordinarily high frequency of FA in a specific subgroup of azoospermic patients (7.1%). The screening for FANCA pathogenic variants in such patients has the potential to identify undiagnosed FA before the appearance of other severe clinical manifestations of the disease. The definition of this high-risk group for ""occult"" FA, based on specific testis phenotype with mild/borderline hematological alterations, is of unforeseen clinical relevance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

12121354,Mutation in the cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein-1 (CDMP1) gene in a kindred affected with fibular hypoplasia and complex brachydactyly (DuPan syndrome).,"The present authors have previously described a consanguineous Pakistani family with fibular hypoplasia and complex brachydactyly (DuPan syndrome) inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. All affected individuals showed either reductions or absence of bones in the limbs, and appendicular bone dysmorphogenesis with unaffected axial bones. Obligate heterozygote parents were phenotypically normal. Mutations in the cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein 1 (CDMP1) gene have been reported in two acromesomelic chondrodysplasias (i.e. Hunter-Thompson type and Grebe type) which are phenotypically related to DuPan syndrome. CDMP1, a member of the transforming growth factor beta super-family of secreted signalling molecules, has been reported to regulate limb patterning and distal bone growth. Therefore, the present authors examined genomic DNA from the family with DuPan syndrome for mutations in the CDMP1 gene. Affected individuals were homozygous for a missense mutation, T1322C, in the coding region of the CDMP1 gene. This mutation was not found in 44 control subjects of Pakistani origin. The T1322C change predicts a leu441pro substitution in the mature domain of the CDMP1 protein. This is likely to cause a conformational change in the CDMP1 protein that influences the expression of genes which are required for normal bone development. This finding extends the spectrum of phenotypes produced by defects in the CDMP1 gene.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

In families with these syndromes, we found homozygous missense mutations in the dorsoventral-patterning gene WNT7A and confirmed their functional significance in retroviral-mediated transfection of chicken mesenchyme cell cultures and developing limbs. The results suggest that a partial loss of WNT7A function causes Fuhrmann syndrome (and a phenotype similar to mouse Wnt7a knockout), whereas the more-severe limb truncation phenotypes observed in Al-Awadi/Raas-Rothschild/Schinzel phocomelia syndrome result from null mutations (and cause a phenotype similar to mouse Shh knockout). These findings illustrate the specific and conserved importance of WNT7A in multiple aspects of vertebrate limb development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; validation study; journal article; case-report"
9128926,"Familial aplasia/hypoplasia of pelvis, femur, fibula, and ulna with abnormal digits in an inbred Pakistani Muslim family: a possible new autosomal recessive disorder with overlapping manifestations of the syndromes of Fuhrmann, Al-Awadi, and Raas-Rothschild.","We describe four affected children belonging to a large, highly inbred Muslim family originating from the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan. All children have a similar pattern of skeletal abnormalities, including aplasia/hypoplasia of the ulnae, hypoplasia of the pelvis, aplasia/hypoplasia of the femora, fibular aplasia, and variable digital abnormalities and absent/dysplastic nails. The phenotype overlaps with the syndromes of Fuhrmann, Al-Awadi, and Raas-Rothschild. The present and previously reported families probably share the same geographic and racial origin, indicating a common genetic basis of the reported skeletal abnormalities in these limb-pelvis aplasia and hypoplasia syndromes. A possibility of a new autosomal recessive syndrome in the present family cannot be excluded. Further delineation and molecular studies are required to clarify the genetic cause and phenotypic variation in Fuhrmann, Al-Awadi, and Raas-Rothschild syndromes.",journal article; case reports
23642083,"Brittle cornea syndrome: recognition, molecular diagnosis and management.","Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by extreme corneal thinning and fragility. Corneal rupture can therefore occur either spontaneously or following minimal trauma in affected patients. Two genes, ZNF469 and PRDM5, have now been identified, in which causative pathogenic mutations collectively account for the condition in nearly all patients with BCS ascertained to date. Therefore, effective molecular diagnosis is now available for affected patients, and those at risk of being heterozygous carriers for BCS. We have previously identified mutations in ZNF469 in 14 families (in addition to 6 reported by others in the literature), and in PRDM5 in 8 families (with 1 further family now published by others). Clinical features include extreme corneal thinning with rupture, high myopia, blue sclerae, deafness of mixed aetiology with hypercompliant tympanic membranes, and variable skeletal manifestations. Corneal rupture may be the presenting feature of BCS, and it is possible that this may be incorrectly attributed to non-accidental injury. Mainstays of management include the prevention of ocular rupture by provision of protective polycarbonate spectacles, careful monitoring of visual and auditory function, and assessment for skeletal complications such as developmental dysplasia of the hip. Effective management depends upon appropriate identification of affected individuals, which may be challenging given the phenotypic overlap of BCS with other connective tissue disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article"

11092512,Plasma galactose and galactitol concentration in patients with galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency galactosemia: determination by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.,"The plasma concentration of galactose and galactitol was measured in 27 patients with galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) deficiency galactosemia on a lactose-restricted diet, 17 infants on lactose-free formula, and 21 infants and children on a normal diet, by a newly devised isotope dilution gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. The method was linear in the range of 0.1 to 10 micromol/L for galactose and 1 to 20 micromol/L for galactitol with good reproducibility and a coefficient of variation less than 3%. The mean plasma galactose in 15 patients who were homozygous for the most common Q188R mutation of the GALT gene was 2.72 +/- 0.70 micromol/L (mean +/- SE) with a range of 0.58 to 3.98 in specimens obtained at regular clinic visits. In 12 patients with other GALT mutations, it was 2.45 +/- 0.75 micromol/L. The mean value in nongalactosemic subjects on lactose-free formula was 0.52 +/- 0.08 micromol/L, with a range of 0.12 to 1.25. The range in 21 normal subjects without diet restriction was 0.11 to 6.33 micromol/L, with a mean of 1.48 +/- 0.32. The plasma galactitol level was 11.63 +/- 0.46 and 10.85 +/- 1.38 micromol/L in the 2 galactosemic groups. There was no relationship between plasma galactose and galactitol levels, with variable ratios of the two substances in the galactosemic patients. Galactitol was not detectable in the plasma of normal subjects. The red blood cell galactose-1-phosphate level was also measured in the galactosemic patients, and no relationship between plasma galactose and red blood cell galactose-1-phosphate was found. The galactose-1-phosphate concentration was 28 to 54 times higher than the ambient galactose. The low galactose concentration in the plasma of galactosemics on galactose-restricted diets in relation to the higher plasma galactitol and red blood cell galactose-1-phosphate is a metabolic enigma. The ability to measure plasma galactose accurately presents a new way of characterizing the galactosemic patient and the levels monitored over time may provide insight into the development of long-term complications associated with the disorder.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
14680973,Galactitol and galactonate in red blood cells of galactosemic patients.,"The red blood cell (RBC) concentration of galactitol and galactonate was measured in 27 patients with galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) deficiency galactosemia and 19 non-galactosemic subjects by a newly devised isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. The method utilizing UL[13C]galactitol and UL[13C]galactonate was reproducible with excellent precision and recovery of 99%. The RBC galactitol in galactosemic patients on galactose-restricted diets averaged 5.98+/-1.2 microM (M+/-SD) with a range of 3.54-8.81 microM. The mean in non-galactosemic patients was 0.73+/-0.31 microM with a range of 0.29-1.29 microM. The mean of RBC galactonate in the same galactosemic patients was 4.16+/-1.32 microM (M+/-SD) with a range of 0.68-6.47, while the mean in non-galactosemic subjects was 1.94+/-0.96 (M+/-SD) with a range of 0.69-3.84. In galactosemic RBC the galactitol was higher than galactonate while this was reversed in non-galactosemic cells. RBC galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) measured at the same time as galactitol and galactonate was 30 times the level of the other two metabolites. There was no relationship between RBC Gal-1-P and galactitol or galactonate. The ability to measure all three galactose metabolites in the same procedure offers the possibility of augmented monitoring of the galactose metabolic status of patients. The measurement of RBC galactitol and galactonate presents a new means of characterizing galactosemic patients and their levels monitored over time may provide new insight in the development of long-term complications observed in afflicted patients.",comparative study; journal article
1333717,"Hydrocephalus, corneal opacities, deafness, valvular heart disease, deformed toes and leptomeningeal fibrous thickening in adult siblings: a new syndrome associated with beta-glucocerebrosidase deficiency and a mosaic population of storage cells.","We describe three adult siblings with communicating hydrocephalus, corneal opacities, deafness, valvular heart disease, and deformed toes associated with glucosylceramide (glc-cer)-beta-glucosidase deficiency. The common manifestations of Gaucher disease were not evident. Supranuclear gaze palsies characteristic of type 3 were noted from early childhood, although the major signs were undeveloped until early adult life. Autopsy disclosed thickened leptomeninges with perivascular fibrosis, non-rheumatic calcified aortic and mitral stenosis with marked fibrosis, and mild infiltration of Gaucher cells in the reticuloendothelial organs. In contrast to the slight accumulation of glc-cer in the liver and spleen, the activity of glc-cer-beta-glucosidase was markedly decreased in the tissues, as much as in a patient with type 2 Gaucher disease.

21415077,Molecular screening of ADAMTSL2 gene in 33 patients reveals the genetic heterogeneity of geleophysic dysplasia.,"Geleophysic dysplasia (GD, OMIM 231050) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by short stature, small hands and feet, stiff joints, and thick skin. Patients often present with a progressive cardiac valvular disease which can lead to an early death. In a previous study including six GD families, we have mapped the disease gene on chromosome 9q34.2 and identified mutations in the A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin repeats-like 2 gene (ADAMTSL2).Following this study, we have collected the samples of 30 additional GD families, including 33 patients and identified ADAMTSL2 mutations in 14/33 patients, comprising 13 novel mutations. The absence of mutation in 19 patients prompted us to compare the two groups of GD patients, namely group 1, patients with ADAMTSL2 mutations (n=20, also including the 6 patients from our previous study), and group 2, patients without ADAMTSL2 mutations (n=19).The main discriminating features were facial dysmorphism and tip-toe walking, which were almost constantly observed in group 1. No differences were found concerning heart involvement, skin thickness, recurrent respiratory and ear infections, bronchopulmonary insufficiency, laryngo-tracheal stenosis, deafness, and radiographic features.It is concluded that GD is a genetically heterogeneous condition. Ongoing studies will hopefully lead to the identification of another disease gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

8316268,Molecular genetic heterogeneity of myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle's disease).,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle's disease) is one of the most common causes of exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, and recurrent myoglobinuria. The myophosphorylase gene has been sequenced and assigned to chromosome 11, but the molecular basis of McArdle's disease is not known. We sequenced complementary DNA in 4 patients and studied genomic DNA by restriction-endonuclease analysis in 40 patients with McArdle's disease. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed three distinct point mutations: the substitution of thymine for cytosine at codon 49 in exon 1, changing an encoded arginine to a stop codon; the substitution of adenine for guanine at codon 204 in exon 5, changing glycine to serine; and the substitution of cytosine for adenine at codon 542 in exon 14, changing lysine to threonine. Analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of appropriate fragments of genomic DNA after amplification with the polymerase chain reaction showed that 18 patients were homozygous for the stop-codon mutation, 6 had different mutations in the two alleles (compound heterozygotes), and 11 were presumed to be compound heterozygotes for a known mutation and an unknown one; only 5 patients had none of the three mutations. All three mutations were present in various combinations in five members of a family in which transmission appeared to be autosomal dominant. CONCLUSIONS: McArdle's disease is genetically heterogeneous, but the most common mutation is the substitution of thymine for cytosine at codon 49. These results suggest that in about 90 percent of patients the diagnosis of McArdle's disease can be made from a patient's leukocytes, thus avoiding the need for muscle biopsy.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
22250184,Genotypic and phenotypic features of McArdle disease: insights from the Spanish national registry.,"Published genotype/phenotype data on McArdle disease are limited in sample size. A single national (Spanish) registry of patients with McArdle disease was created with the purpose of analysing their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics.A cross sectional study was conducted, collecting demographic, family history, clinical, genotype and functional capacity data from all patients diagnosed with McArdle disease in the Spanish National Health System up to December 2010.239 cases were recorded (all of Caucasian descent, 102 women; mean±SD age 44±18 years (range 9, 93)); prevalence of ∼1/167 000 people. Two mutant PYGM alleles were identified in 99.6% of cases. Although there was heterogeneity in the severity of symptoms, there were four common diagnostic features: (1) 99.5% of patients reported a history of acute crises of exercise intolerance (accompanied by recurrent myoglobinuria in 50% of cases); (2) in 58% of patients, symptoms started in the first decade of life; (3) 86% of patients repeatedly experienced the 'second wind' phenomenon over life; and (4) 99% of patients had a high basal serum level of total creatine kinase (>200 U/l). Clinical presentation of the disease was similar in men and women and worsened with age. Patients who were physically active had higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (by 23%, p=0.003) and were more likely to improve their clinical course over a 4 year period compared with inactive patients (OR 225; 95% CI 20.3 to 2496.7).The main clinical features of McArdle disease are generally homogeneous and frequently appear during childhood; clinical condition deteriorates with ageing. Active patients have a better clinical outcome and functional capacity.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
25266922,The natural history of glycogen storage disease types VI and IX: Long-term outcome from the largest metabolic center in Canada.,"OBJECTIVES: Glycogen storage disease (GSD) types VI and IX are caused by phosphorylase system deficiencies. To evaluate the natural history and long-term treatment outcome of the patients with GSD-VI and -IX, we performed an observational retrospective case study of 21 patients with confirmed diagnosis of GSD-VI or -IX. METHODS: All patients with GSD-VI or -IX, diagnosed at The Hospital for Sick Children, were included. Electronic and paper charts were reviewed for clinical features, biochemical investigations, molecular genetic testing, diagnostic imaging, long-term outcome and treatment by two independent research team members. All information was entered into an Excel database. RESULTS: We report on the natural history and treatment outcomes of the 21 patients with GSD-VI and -IX and 16 novel pathogenic mutations in the PHKA2, PHKB, PHKG2 and PYGL genes. We report for the first time likely liver adenoma on liver ultrasound and liver fibrosis on liver biopsy specimens in patients with GSD-VI and mild cardiomyopathy on echocardiography in patients with GSD-VI and -IXb. CONCLUSION: We recommend close monitoring in all patients with GSD-VI and -IX for the long-term liver and cardiac complications. There is a need for future studies if uncooked cornstarch and high protein diet would be able to prevent long-term complications of GSD-VI and -IX.",journal article; observational study
18422995,Characterization of six novel mutations in CYBA: the gene causing autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease.,"One of the rarest forms of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is caused by mutations in CYBA, which encodes the p22-phox subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, leading to defective intracellular killing. This study investigated eight patients (six males and two females) from seven consanguineous, unrelated families with clinical CGD, positive family history and p22-phox deficiency. Mutation analysis of CYBA showed six different novel mutations: deletion of exons 3, 4 and 5; a missense mutation in exon 6 (c.373G>A); a splice site mutation in intron 5 (c.369+1G>A); a frameshift in exon 6 (c.385delGAGC); a frameshift in exon 3 (c.174delG); and a frameshift in exon 4 (c.223delC).",journal article; case reports
19329991,A novel mutation in NCF1 in an adult CGD patient with a liver abscess as first presentation.,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an immunodeficiency caused by defects in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase complex and is usually diagnosed in early childhood. CGD patients suffer from severe, recurrent infections with bacteria, fungi and yeasts. We report a 25-year-old female with protracted fever because of a Staphylococcus aureus liver abscess, which did not resolve until breakthrough into the stomach. Despite her age, CGD was considered on diagnosis on the basis of the clinical symptoms. Analysis of the NADPH-oxidase activity confirmed CGD as the underlying condition. Western blotting revealed the absence of p47(phox) and subsequent sequencing of the p47(phox)-encoding gene, neutrophil cytosolic factor (NCF1), identified a deletion of 837C in the maternal NCF1 allele. The paternal allele contained a stopcodon because of a conversion between NCF1 and one of its PsiNCF1 pseudogenes. The patient had one novel mutation, c.837delC, and one conversion in NCF1, resulting in the complete absence of the p47(phox) component of the NADPH-oxidase complex. This p47(phox)-deficient CGD patient had the highest age at diagnosis reported thus far.",journal article; case reports
7795241,AG dinucleotide insertion in a patient with chronic granulomatous disease lacking cytosolic 67-kD protein.,"The 67-kD cytosolic protein (p67-phox) is an essential component of the superoxide-generating system in phagocytes, and its defect is known to cause chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). We sequenced p67-phox cDNA from one of seven patients found in Japan and his parents. In the patient's cDNA, homozygous AG dinucleotide insertion at position 399 (or 401) was found together with three other homozygous substitutions in a coding region (A-542 to G, T-895 to C and A-983 to G) compared with the sequence reported for HL-60 cells. In cDNA from his parents, the AG insertion was found to be heterozygous. In contrast, the other three substitutions were found homozygously in his father's specimen and the latter two in his mother's specimen. The substitution of A-542 to G was heterozygous in his mother's cDNA. The AG insertion would induce a frame shift and bring about a stop codon at the position of 433. However, the other three differences would give insignificant changes for the protein function, if any, because the substitutions of A-542 to G and A-983 to G result in the conservative amino acid transitions, ie, Lys-180 to Arg and Lys-327 to Arg, and that of T-895 to C no amino acid change. Neutrophils from the patients completely lacked superoxide generating activity whereas those from his parents generated substantial amounts of superoxide anion upon stimulation. Thus, it is concluded that the AG dinucleotide insertion is responsible for the disease in this patient.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

17958891,Mowat-Wilson syndrome.,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by a distinct facial phenotype (high forehead, frontal bossing, large eyebrows, medially flaring and sparse in the middle part, hypertelorism, deep set but large eyes, large and uplifted ear lobes, with a central depression, saddle nose with prominent rounded nasal tip, prominent columella, open mouth, with M-shaped upper lip, frequent smiling, and a prominent but narrow and triangular pointed chin), moderate-to-severe intellectual deficiency, epilepsy and variable congenital malformations including Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), genitourinary anomalies (in particular hypospadias in males), congenital heart defects, agenesis of the corpus callosum and eye anomalies. The prevalence of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported so far. It seems probable that MWS is under-diagnosed, particularly in patients without HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, previously called ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, over 100 deletions/mutations have been reported in patients with a typical phenotype; they are frequently whole gene deletions or truncating mutations, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the main pathological mechanism. Studies of genotype-phenotype analysis show that facial gestalt and delayed psychomotor development are constant clinical features, while the frequent and severe congenital malformations are variable. In a small number of patients, unusual mutations can lead to an atypical phenotype. The facial phenotype is particularly important for the initial clinical diagnosis and provides the hallmark warranting ZEB2 mutational analysis, even in the absence of HSCR. The majority of MWS cases reported so far were sporadic, therefore the recurrence risk is low. Nevertheless, rare cases of sibling recurrence have been observed. Congenital malformations and seizures require precocious clinical investigation with intervention of several specialists (including neonatologists and pediatricians). Psychomotor development is delayed in all patients, therefore rehabilitation (physical therapy, psychomotor and speech therapy) should be started as soon as possible.",review-article; review; journal article
29300384,Phenotype and genotype of 87 patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome and recommendations for care.,"PURPOSE:Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare intellectual disability/multiple congenital anomalies syndrome caused by heterozygous mutation of the ZEB2 gene. It is generally underestimated because its rarity and phenotypic variability sometimes make it difficult to recognize. Here, we aimed to better delineate the phenotype, natural history, and genotype-phenotype correlations of MWS. METHODS:In a collaborative study, we analyzed clinical data for 87 patients with molecularly confirmed diagnosis. We described the prevalence of all clinical aspects, including attainment of neurodevelopmental milestones, and compared the data with the various types of underlying ZEB2 pathogenic variations. RESULTS:All anthropometric, somatic, and behavioral features reported here outline a variable but highly consistent phenotype. By presenting the most comprehensive evaluation of MWS to date, we define its clinical evolution occurring with age and derive suggestions for patient management. Furthermore, we observe that its severity correlates with the kind of ZEB2 variation involved, ranging from ZEB2 locus deletions, associated with severe phenotypes, to rare nonmissense intragenic mutations predicted to preserve some ZEB2 protein functionality, accompanying milder clinical presentations. CONCLUSION:Knowledge of the phenotypic spectrum of MWS and its correlation with the genotype will improve its detection rate and the prediction of its features, thus improving patient care.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17103451,Clinical features and management issues in Mowat-Wilson syndrome.,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a relatively newly described multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome. Haploinsufficiency of a gene termed ZFHX1B (also known as SIP1) on chromosome 2 is responsible for this condition, and clinical genetic testing for MWS recently became available. The majority of reports in the literature originate from Northern Europe and Australia. Here we report our clinical experience with 12 patients diagnosed with MWS within a 2-year period of time in the United States, with particular emphasis on clinical characteristics and management strategies. Individuals with this condition have characteristic facial features, including microcephaly, hypertelorism, medially flared and broad eyebrows, prominent columella, pointed chin, and uplifted earlobes, which typically prompt the clinician to consider the diagnosis. Medical issues in our cohort of patients included seizures (75%) with no predeliction for any particular seizure type; agenesis of the corpus callosum (60% of our patients studied); congenital heart defects (75%), particularly involving the pulmonary arteries and/or valves; hypospadias (55% of males); severely impaired or absent speech (100% of individuals over 1 year of age) with relatively spared receptive language; and Hirschsprung disease (50%) or chronic constipation (25%). The incidence of MWS is unknown, but based on the number of patients identified in a short period of time within the US, it is likely greatly under recognized. MWS should be considered in any individual with severely impaired or absent speech, especially in the presence of seizures and anomalies involving the pulmonary arteries (particularly pulmonary artery sling) or pulmonary valves.",journal article
3736769,Homocarnosinosis: influence of dietary restriction of histidine.,"Homocarnosinosis, an inherited disorder, is characterized by an elevated level of the dipeptide homocarnosine (Hca) in the CSF and the brain and, in addition, by carnosinuria and serum carnosinase deficiency. In three children with homocarnosinosis the biochemical aberration co-exists with paraplegia, retinitis pigmentosa, and a progressive mental deficiency. In the mother, however, only the biochemical aberration was present without clinical symptoms. In order to study whether this elevated level of Hca and increased excretion of carnosine (Car) could be reduced towards normal, a dietary regiment with restriction of histidine (His) was maintained for nearly 2 1/2 years for two of the patients, 33 and 39 years old, with homocarnosinosis associated with neurological symptoms. His was reduced by about 90% in the CSF, in the plasma and in the urine. Within 5-6 months CSF Hca was reduced by about 70%, and urinary Car by 22 and 42%. The clinical neurological symptoms, however, did not alter significantly together with these biochemical changes.",journal article; case reports
20301697,Homocystinuria Caused by Cystathionine Beta-Synthase Deficiency,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Homocystinuria caused by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency is characterized by involvement of the eye (ectopia lentis and/or severe myopia), skeletal system (excessive height, long limbs, scolioisis, and pectus excavatum), vascular system (thromboembolism), and CNS (developmental delay/intellectual disability). All four ‒ or only one ‒ of the systems can be involved; expressivity is variable for all of the clinical signs. It is not unusual for a previously asymptomatic individual to present in adult years with only a thromboembolic event that is often cerebrovascular. Two phenotypic variants are recognized, B6-responsive homocystinuria and B6-non-responsive homocystinuria. B6-responsive homocystinuria is usually milder than the non-responsive variant. Thromboembolism is the major cause of early death and morbidity. IQ in individuals with untreated homocystinuria ranges widely, from 10 to 138. In B6-responsive individuals the mean IQ is 79 versus 57 for those who are B6-non-responsive. Other features that may occur include: seizures, psychiatric problems, extrapyramidal signs (e.g., dystonia), hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, malar flush, livedo reticularis, and pancreatitis. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The cardinal biochemical features of homocystinuria include markedly increased concentrations of plasma total homocysteine and methionine. The diagnosis can be substantiated by detection of biallelic pathogenic variants in CBS, the gene encoding cystathionine β-synthase. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Treatment aims to correct the biochemical abnormalities, especially to control the plasma homocysteine concentrations and prevent thrombosis. Complications of homocystinuria should be managed appropriately; e.g., by surgery for ectopia lentis. Prevention of primary manifestations: Individuals are treated to maintain normal or near-normal plasma total homocysteine concentrations using vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) therapy (if shown to be B6 responsive), a methionine-restricted diet, and folate and vitamin B12 supplementation. Betaine therapy is usually added to the therapeutic regimen; in adolescents and adults, betaine may be the major form of treatment, but it is preferable to remain on life-long metabolic diet. Surveillance: Affected individuals should be monitored at regular intervals to detect any clinical complications that may develop, for dietary compliance and for measurement of plasma total homocysteine and amino acids. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Oral contraceptives in affected females. Surgery if possible. If surgery is required, intravenous fluid with 5% dextrose in 0.5 normal saline at 1.5 times maintenance should be given and continued until oral fluids are taken ad lib, with close monitoring to avoid fluid overload. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Measurement of total homocysteine and amino acids in at-risk sibs immediately after birth ensures reduction of morbidity and mortality by early diagnosis and treatment. If the CBS pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of sibs Pregnancy management: For women with classic homocystinuria: dietary treatment and betaine, and vitamin B6 for those B6 responsive, with careful biochemical monitoring throughout pregnancy. Prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular-weight heparin is recommended during the third trimester and post partum to reduce risk of thromboembolism. GENETIC COUNSELING:Homocystinuria is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the CBS pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member.",book; review
9775245,Ophthalmic abnormalities in homocystinuria: the value of screening.,"PURPOSE: Homocystinuria, a genetic metabolic abnormality, eventually causes a variety of ocular and other pathologies if not treated. To evaluate the results of screening newborns for homocystinuria, we compared ophthalmic outcomes for two groups of homocystinuria patients who had been diagnosed either at birth or later than 6 weeks. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen patients had been screened and diagnosed shortly after birth, with treatment instigated before 6 weeks of age (mean follow-up and age 10.8 years; median 11 years). Eight of 17 were myopic; 13 of 15 had good vision in both eyes; one had lens subluxation. The second group of 17 patients were diagnosed later than 6 weeks, often (12 patients) because of ocular problems (mean follow-up 8.3 years; mean age 19.4 years; median age 16 years). Visual function varied from 6/6 (4 patients) to less than 6/36 (4 patients); 3 eyes had no perception of light. Thirteen patients had lens subluxation or dislocation.

31004071,Nonsense mutation in CFAP43 causes normal-pressure hydrocephalus with ciliary abnormalities.,"OBJECTIVE:To identify genes related to normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in one Japanese family with several members with NPH. METHODS:We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on a Japanese family with multiple individuals with NPH and identified a candidate gene. Then we generated knockout mouse using CRISPR/Cas9 to confirm the effect of the candidate gene on the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. RESULTS:In WES, we identified a loss-of-function variant in CFAP43 that segregated with the disease. CFAP43 encoding cilia- and flagella-associated protein is preferentially expressed in the testis. Recent studies have revealed that mutations in this gene cause male infertility owing to morphologic abnormalities of sperm flagella. We knocked out mouse ortholog Cfap43 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, resulting in Cfap43-deficient mice that exhibited a hydrocephalus phenotype with morphologic abnormality of motile cilia. CONCLUSION:Our results strongly suggest that CFAP43 is responsible for morphologic or movement abnormalities of cilia in the brain that result in NPH.",research-article; journal article

22232210,Complete OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiency causes human Rotor syndrome by interrupting conjugated bilirubin reuptake into the liver.,"Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Because of parental consanguinity and sib recurrences autosomal recessive inheritance has been proposed. We report three sibs with a syndrome consisting of severe mental retardation, considerably elevated serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, hypoplastic terminal phalanges, and distinct facial features. Clinically and radiologically, shortness of distal phalanges could be demonstrated in all of them. Their particular facial appearance led us to two earlier reported familial cases with convincing clinical similarities.

20524212,Type I hyperprolinemia: genotype/phenotype correlations.,"Type I hyperprolinemia (HPI) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with cognitive and psychiatric troubles, caused by alterations of the Proline Dehydrogenase gene (PRODH) at 22q11. HPI results from PRODH deletion and/or missense mutations reducing proline oxidase (POX) activity. The goals of this study were first to measure in controls the frequency of PRODH variations described in HPI patients, second to assess the functional effect of PRODH mutations on POX activity, and finally to establish genotype/enzymatic activity correlations in a new series of HPI patients. Eight of 14 variants occurred at polymorphic frequency in 114 controls. POX activity was determined for six novel mutations and two haplotypes. The c.1331G>A, p.G444D allele has a drastic effect, whereas the c.23C>T, p.P8L allele and the c.[56C>A; 172G>A], p.[Q19P; A58T] haplotype result in a moderate decrease in activity. Among the 19 HPI patients, 10 had a predicted residual activity <50%. Eight out of nine subjects with a predicted residual activity > or = 50% bore at least one c.824C>A, p.T275N allele, which has no detrimental effect on activity but whose frequency in controls is only 3%. Our results suggest that PRODH mutations lead to a decreased POX activity or affect other biological parameters causing hyperprolinemia.",journal article
17412540,Early neurological phenotype in 4 children with biallelic PRODH mutations.,"Hyperprolinemia type I (HPI) results from a deficiency of proline oxidase (POX), involved in the first step in the conversion of proline to glutamate. Diverse phenotypes were described in patients with HPI, prior to the identification of the POX gene (PRODH): whereas various patients were asymptomatic, others had neurological and extraneurological defects. The PRODH gene is located in the region deleted in velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). Heterozygous and homozygous mutations have been identified in patients with variable hyperprolinemia and various features (patients with schizophrenia, chromosome 22q11 microdeletions and/or neurological defects). A functional study has divided the PRODH missense mutations into three groups: those leading to mild, moderate, or severe reduction of POX activity. In this study, we report four unrelated children with HPI and a homogeneous severe neurological phenotype. We identified biallelic abnormalities in PRODH in these patients that led to severe reduction of POX activity. These included missense and non-sense mutations, deletions of PRODH and a 22q11 microdeletion. Four other children have been reported with severe biallelic PRODH mutations. The phenotype of these eight patients associates early psychomotor development delay with predominant cognitive defects, autistic features and epilepsy. Their values of hyperprolinemia ranged from 400 to 2200 micromol/L. Patients with biallelic PRODH alterations resulting in severely impaired POX activity had an early onset and severe neurological features. Thus, children with this phenotype and those with a microdeletion in chromosome 22q11, especially those with mental retardation and autistic features, should be tested for hyperprolinemia. Hyperprolinemic patients should be screened for PRODH mutations.",journal article
23462603,Identification of PRODH mutations in Korean neonates with type I hyperprolinemia.,"Hyperprolinemia is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by a high proline level in blood and/or urine and various neuropsychiatric symptoms. Type I hyperprolinemia is caused by a proline oxidase deficiency, which is encoded by the PRODH gene on chromosome 22q11. Herein, we present a study of Korean patients with type I hyperprolinemia who were diagnosed during newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry and confirmed by molecular analysis.Four neonates were referred to our hospital for workup of high proline levels in newborn screening test. We analyzed the biochemical findings and the PRODH gene was amplified by long-range PCR to confirm molecular genetic abnormalities.All patients had high plasma proline levels, ranging from 742 to 1192 μmol/L (reference range, 77.4 - 244.6 μmol/L). In molecular analysis, 4 disease-associated mutant alleles were identified: c.1414G>A (p.A472T), c.1279G>A (p.V427M), c.1357C>T (p.R453C) and c.1562A>G (p.Q521R). All mutations were missense and c.1279G>A included the majority of mutant alleles. No relationships between type of mutation and clinical outcomes were observed.We found that distinct molecular alterations of the PRODH gene result in abnormal proline levels. Newborn screening and molecular analysis are necessary to identify patients before clinical expression of metabolic disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
11510941,Is hyperprolinemia type I actually a benign trait? Report of a case with severe neurologic involvement and vigabatrin intolerance.,"Hyperprolinemia type I is a deficiency of proline oxidase (McKusick 23950), leading to hyperprolinemia and iminoglycinuria, usually with renal involvement. Hyperprolinemia type I is considered a benign trait. We reported a case of hyperprolinemia type I with a severe neurologic disorder and without renal involvement. The patient had marked psychomotor delay and right hemiparesis. Epilepsy was characterized by status epilepticus or a cluster of seizures. Laboratory findings revealed elevated levels of proline in the serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid without delta1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase in the plasma or urine. Fluorescence in situ hybridization excluded a chromosome 22q11 deletion. Vigabatrin inhibits ornithine transaminase. Thus, vigabatrin could lead to a depletion of the normal pool of pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase and could aggravate the clinical condition of the child. In this study, vigabatrin was discontinued. In the following months, the patient had marked psychomotor improvement, without modification of the epilepsy. We suggest that vigabatrin should be avoided in hyperprolinemia type I.",journal article; case reports
11836330,Delineation of the molecular defects in the AIRE gene in autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy patients from Southern Italy.,"In this study, we have carried out molecular analysis of the AIRE (autoimmune regulator) gene in 11 patients (from 8 families) affected by autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy, originating from a restricted area of Southern Italy (the Salento peninsula in Puglia). Of the 16 mutant AIRE alleles from the 8 probands studied, 12 carried a missense mutation (W78R in 9, P539L in 2, and P252L in 1), 2 carried the Q358X nonsense mutation, and 2 carried the 1058delT frameshift mutation. All these mutations except the 1058delT are novel. Each of the detected mutations either predicts a premature termination of the protein or results in a nonconservative amino acid change, most likely adversely affecting the function of the protein. The W78R missense mutation is relatively common in these patients, having been detected (in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity) in 6 of the 8 probands tested, indicating the presence of a founder effect. The results of this study contribute to the delineation of the molecular pathology of the AIRE gene and enhance our ability to perform a molecular diagnosis in autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy patients from Southern Italy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15690347,"Inheritance analysis of congenital left ventricular outflow tract obstruction malformations: Segregation, multiplex relative risk, and heritability.","The left ventricular outflow tract (LVOTO) malformations, aortic valve stenosis (AVS), coarctation of the aorta (COA), and hypoplastic left heart (HLH) constitute a mechanistically defined subgroup of congenital heart defects that have substantial evidence for a genetic component. Evidence from echocardiography studies has shown that bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is found frequently in relatives of children with LVOTO defects. However, formal inheritance analysis has not been performed. We ascertained 124 families by an index case with AVS, COA, or HLH. A total of 413 relatives were enrolled in the study, of which 351 had detailed echocardiography exams for structural heart defects and measurements of a variety of aortic arch, left ventricle, and valve structures. LVOTO malformations were noted in 30 relatives (18 BAV, 5 HLH, 3 COA, and 3 AVS), along with significant congenital heart defects (CHD) in 2 others (32/413; 7.7%). Relative risk for first-degree relatives in this group was 36.9, with a heritability of 0.71-0.90. Formal segregation analysis suggests that one or more minor loci with rare dominant alleles may be operative in a subset of families. Multiplex relative risk analysis, which estimates number of loci, had the highest maximum likelihood score in a model with 2 loci (range of 1-6 in the lod-1 support interval). Heritability of several aortic arch measurements and aortic valve was significant. These data support a complex but most likely oligogenic pattern of inheritance. A combination of linkage and association study designs is likely to enable LVOTO risk gene identification. This data can also provide families with important information for screening asymptomatic relatives for potentially harmful cardiac defects.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
10588719,The DNMT3B DNA methyltransferase gene is mutated in the ICF immunodeficiency syndrome.,"DNA methylation is an important regulator of genetic information in species ranging from bacteria to humans. DNA methylation appears to be critical for mammalian development because mice nullizygous for a targeted disruption of the DNMT1 DNA methyltransferase die at an early embryonic stage. No DNA methyltransferase mutations have been reported in humans until now. We describe here the first example of naturally occurring mutations in a mammalian DNA methyltransferase gene. These mutations occur in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder, which is termed the ICF syndrome, for immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomalies. Centromeric instability of chromosomes 1, 9, and 16 is associated with abnormal hypomethylation of CpG sites in their pericentromeric satellite regions. We are able to complement this hypomethylation defect by somatic cell fusion to Chinese hamster ovary cells, suggesting that the ICF gene is conserved in the hamster and promotes de novo methylation. ICF has been localized to a 9-centimorgan region of chromosome 20 by homozygosity mapping. By searching for homologies to known DNA methyltransferases, we identified a genomic sequence in the ICF region that contains the homologue of the mouse Dnmt3b methyltransferase gene. Using the human sequence to screen ICF kindreds, we discovered mutations in four patients from three families. Mutations include two missense substitutions and a 3-aa insertion resulting from the creation of a novel 3' splice acceptor. None of the mutations were found in over 200 normal chromosomes. We conclude that mutations in the DNMT3B are responsible for the ICF syndrome.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
6611555,Immunodeficiency with defective T-cell response to interleukin 1.,"Normal proliferation of T cells in vitro requires production of and response to the lymphokine interleukin 2 (IL-2). Optimal IL-2 production by T cells is dependent on the monokine interleukin 1 (IL-1). A 10-year-old male with recurrent infections and failure to thrive was evaluated for possible defects in the production and response to IL-1 and IL-2. The patient had normal levels of serum immunoglobulins and a normal distribution of circulating T-cell subsets. However, the in vitro proliferative response of his peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to phytohemagglutinin was depressed (40% of normal) and the response of his PBMC to antigens was absent. Delayed hypersensitivity skin tests and in vitro response to tetanus toxoid remained absent despite repeated immunizations. Monocyte function in this patient was normal as judged by the following criteria: normal expression of Ia antigens (77% +), normal IL-1 production, and normal capacity to present tetanus toxoid to a maternal T-cell line specific for tetanus toxoid antigen. The abnormal phytohemagglutinin response of the patient's PBMC was corrected by the addition of exogenous IL-2. IL-2 production by the patient's phytohemagglutin-stimulated PBMC was severely deficient but was corrected by the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, suggesting a defective response to IL-1. T-cell blasts derived from a normal subject but not T-cell blasts derived from the patient absorbed out IL-1 activity from a preparation of purified human IL-1. These results indicate that the patient's T-cell deficiency was due to a defective T-cell response to IL-1 and suggest that IL-1 plays an important role in the in vivo immune response.",systematic review; systematic-review; journal article
19478059,ATP8B1 is essential for maintaining normal hearing.,"ATP8B1 deficiency is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in ATP8B1, which encodes the putative phospatidylserine flippase ATP8B1 (formerly called FIC1). ATP8B1 deficiency is primarily characterized by cholestasis, but extrahepatic symptoms are also found. Because patients sometimes report reduced hearing capability, we investigated the role of ATP8B1 in auditory function. Here we show that ATP8B1/Atp8b1 deficiency, both in patients and in Atp8b1(G308V/G308V) mutant mice, causes hearing loss, associated with progressive degeneration of cochlear hair cells. Atp8b1 is specifically localized in the stereocilia of these hair cells. This indicates that the mechanosensory function and integrity of the cochlear hair cells is critically dependent on ATP8B1 activity, possibly through maintaining lipid asymmetry in the cellular membranes of stereocilia.",research-article; journal article
26583190,Baraitser-Winter Cerebrofrontofacial Syndrome,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial (BWCFF) syndrome is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by typical craniofacial features and intellectual disability (ID) that ranges from mild (usually in those with normal brain structure) to profound (typically in those with a neuronal migration defect). Many (but not all) affected individuals have iris or retinal coloboma, sensorineural deafness, and muscle wasting resulting in a peculiar stance with kyphosis, anteverted shoulders, and slightly flexed elbows and knees. Seizures, congenital heart defects, and renal malformations also are common. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of BWCFF syndrome is established in a proband with a compatible clinical phenotype and a heterozygous gain-of-function variant in either ACTB or ACTG1. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. Developmental delay requires specific support (speech therapy, physical therapy) adapted to the severity of the handicap. Surveillance: Routine follow up recommended for neurodevelopmental assessment in all; follow up as needed for those with coloboma (ophthalmologic evaluation), hearing loss (audiologic evaluation), cardiac defects, and renal tract anomalies. GENETIC COUNSELING:BWCFF syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all affected individuals have had a de novo pathogenic variant. The risk to sibs is low but presumed to be greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of germline mosaicism. If the ACTB or ACTG1 pathogenic variant is known, prenatal testing for subsequent pregnancies of the parents of an affected child is possible.",book; review

Using a next-generation sequencing approach, we identified mutations in a novel centriolar disease gene in a kindred with an embryonic lethal ciliopathy phenotype and in a patient with primary microcephaly.Whole exome sequencing data from a non-consanguineous Caucasian kindred exhibiting mid-gestation lethality and ciliopathic malformations revealed two novel non-synonymous variants in CENPF, a microtubule-regulating gene. All four affected fetuses showed segregation for two mutated alleles [IVS5-2A>C, predicted to abolish the consensus splice-acceptor site from exon 6; c.1744G>T, p.E582X]. In a second unrelated patient exhibiting microcephaly, we identified two CENPF mutations [c.1744G>T, p.E582X; c.8692 C>T, p.R2898X] by whole exome sequencing. We found that CENP-F colocalised with Ninein at the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole in mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells. Intraflagellar transport protein-88 (IFT-88) colocalised with CENP-F along the ciliary axonemes of renal epithelial cells in age-matched control human fetuses but did not in truncated cilia of mutant CENPF kidneys. Pairwise co-immunoprecipitation assays of mitotic and serum-starved HEKT293 cells confirmed that IFT88 precipitates with endogenous CENP-F.Our data identify CENPF as a new centriolar disease gene implicated in severe human ciliopathy and microcephaly related phenotypes.

Although the function of UBE3A has been widely studied, little is known about its paralog UBE3B. By using exome and capillary sequencing, we here identify biallelic UBE3B mutations in four patients from three unrelated families presenting an autosomal-recessive blepharophimosis-ptosis-intellectual-disability syndrome characterized by developmental delay, growth retardation with a small head circumference, facial dysmorphisms, and low cholesterol levels. UBE3B encodes an uncharacterized E3 ubiquitin ligase. The identified UBE3B variants include one frameshift and two splice-site mutations as well as a missense substitution affecting the highly conserved HECT domain. Disruption of mouse Ube3b leads to reduced viability and recapitulates key aspects of the human disorder, such as reduced weight and brain size and a downregulation of cholesterol synthesis. We establish that the probable Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of UBE3B, oxi-1, functions in the ubiquitin/proteasome system in vivo and is especially required under oxidative stress conditions. Our data reveal the pleiotropic effects of UBE3B deficiency and reinforce the physiological importance of ubiquitination in neuronal development and function in mammals.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Hereditary SCOT deficiency causes episodic ketoacidosis. Here we describe the human SCOT gene, which spans more than 100 kb and contains 17 exons, on chromosome 5p13. We report pathogenic missense mutations in three SCOT-deficient patients designated GS04, 05, and 06. GS04 is a G219E/G324E compound; GS05 is a V221M homozygote, and GS06 is a G324E homozygote. We constructed a tertiary structural model of human SCOT by homology modeling based on the known structure of Acidaminococcus fermentans glutaconate CoA transferase. The model predicts that V221 and G219 are on the dimerizing surface, whereas G324 is near the active site. SCOT activity was reduced to a comparable degree in all three patients, but in a transient expression assay in SCOT-deficient fibroblasts, cDNAs containing G219E and G324E produced no detectable activity, whereas V221M constructs yielded approximately 10% of the control peptide level and detectable specific activity.

11313242,Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency: homozygous recessive inheritance of a frameshift mutation in the gene encoding transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein--epsilon.,"Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency (SGD) is a rare congenital disorder. The neutrophils of individuals with SGD display atypical bi-lobed nuclei, lack expression of all secondary and tertiary granule proteins, and possess defects in chemotaxis, disaggregation, receptor up-regulation, and bactericidal activity, resulting in frequent and severe bacterial infections. Previously, a homozygous mutation in the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-epsilon (C/EBPepsilon) gene was reported for one case of SGD. To substantiate the role of C/EBPepsilon in the development of SGD and elucidate its mechanism of inheritance, the mutational status of the gene was determined in a second individual. An A-nucleotide insertion in the coding region of the C/EBPepsilon gene was detected. This mutation completely abolished the predicted translation of all C/EBPepsilon isoforms. Microsatellite and nucleotide sequence analyses of the C/EBPepsilon locus in the parents of the proband indicated that the disorder may have resulted from homozygous recessive inheritance of the mutant allele from an ancestor shared by both parents. The mutant C/EBPepsilon(32) protein localized in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus and was unable to activate transcription. Consistent with this, a significant decrease in the levels of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the secondary granule protein human 18-kd cationic antimicrobial protein (hCAP-18)/LL-37 and the primary granule protein bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein were observed in the patient. The hCAP-18 mRNA was induced by overexpression of C/EBPepsilon(32) in the human myeloid leukemia cell line, U937, supporting the hypothesis that C/EBPepsilon is a key regulator of granule gene synthesis. This study strongly implicates mutation of the C/EBPepsilon gene as the primary genetic defect involved in the development of neutrophil SGD and defines its mechanism of inheritance.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)epsilon, a member of the leucine zipper family of transcription factors, is expressed primarily in myeloid cells, and its knockout mouse model possesses distinctive defects, including a lack of neutrophil secondary granule proteins. Sequence analysis of the genomic DNA of a patient with SGD revealed a five-basepair deletion in the second exon of the C/EBPepsilon locus. The predicted frame shift results in a truncation of the 32-kD major C/EBPepsilon isoform, with loss of the dimerization domain, DNA binding region, and transcriptional activity. The multiple functional defects observed in these early neutrophil progenitor cells, a consequence of C/EBPepsilon deficiency, define SGD as a defect in myelopoiesis and establish the requirement for C/EBPepsilon for the promyelocyte-myelocyte transition in myeloid differentiation.",research-article; journal article
23705938,A neonatal case of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric-coenzyme A lyase deficiency.,"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria (OMIM 246450) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn of metabolism due to the deficiency of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) lyase, an enzyme involved both in the ketogenic pathway and leucine catabolism. Acute decompensations present with lethargy, cianosis, hypotonia, vomiting and metabolic acidosis with hypoketotic hypoglycemia. We report the case of a 3 days male with sudden hypoglycemic crisis initially misdiagnosed as a sepsis. HMG-CoA lyase deficiency was achieved through acyl-carnitines profile (showing a typical increasing of 3-hydroxy-isovaleryl and 3-methylgluraryl carnitines) and urinary organic acids analysis (disclosing elevation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 3-methyl-glutaconic, 3-methylglutaric and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acids). This case underlines the need of suspecting such inborn metabolic disorder in cases with hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis. Acyl-carnitine and urinary organic acids profiles are essential to achieve a prompt diagnosis of treatable metabolic disorders in order to prevent their acute crisis with serious or even fatal consequences.",journal article; case reports; case-report
22626821,Normal and pathologic concentrations of uremic toxins.,"An updated review of the existing knowledge regarding uremic toxins facilitates the design of experimental studies. We performed a literature search and found 621 articles about uremic toxicity published after a 2003 review of this topic. Eighty-seven records provided serum or blood measurements of one or more solutes in patients with CKD. These records described 32 previously known uremic toxins and 56 newly reported solutes. The articles most frequently reported concentrations of β2-microglobulin, indoxyl sulfate, homocysteine, uric acid, and parathyroid hormone. We found most solutes (59%) in only one report. Compared with previous results, more recent articles reported higher uremic concentrations of many solutes, including carboxymethyllysine, cystatin C, and parathyroid hormone. However, five solutes had uremic concentrations less than 10% of the originally reported values. Furthermore, the uremic concentrations of four solutes did not exceed their respective normal concentrations, although they had been previously described as uremic retention solutes. In summary, this review extends the classification of uremic retention solutes and their normal and uremic concentrations, and it should aid the design of experiments to study the biologic effects of these solutes in CKD.",research-article; journal article
2426307,Hypobetalipoproteinemia with accumulation of an apoprotein B-like protein in intestinal cells. Immunoenzymatic and biochemical characterization of seven cases of Anderson's disease.,"We describe here seven cases (from five kindreds) of Anderson's disease, which is characterized by diarrhea, steatorrhea, hypobetalipoproteinemia with low levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, and failure to secrete chylomicrons after a fat meal. Enterocytes isolated from intestinal biopsies of patients after overnight fast showed numerous fat droplets, a histological picture resembling that of abetalipoproteinemia. Immunoenzymatic staining of the enterocytes demonstrated large amounts of material that reacted with a polyclonal antiserum to apolipoprotein B. Further, the immunoreactive material was found to react with several different monoclonal antibodies capable of recognizing both the B100 and B48 forms of apoprotein B, but not with any of several monoclonal antibodies capable of recognizing only B100. This suggests that the material in the enterocytes is the B48 form of apoprotein B or a fragment thereof. Additional findings included decreased low density lipoprotein levels with an abnormal chemical composition, abnormal high density lipoprotein2 (HDL2) and HDL3 particle size distributions, and an abnormal HDL apoprotein composition. Increased amounts of proteins having electrophoretic mobilities similar to apo E and the E-AII complex were present. Finally, some cases exhibited additional protein components of apparent molecular weights between 17,000 and 28,000, which was similar to some cases of abetalipoproteinemia. These findings demonstrate that Anderson's disease is not due to the absence of synthesis of intestinal apo B and suggest that it is more complex than previously thought, affecting all the lipoprotein classes.",editorial
1671808,Clinical and molecular diagnosis of Miller-Dieker syndrome.,"We report results of clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular studies in 27 patients with Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) from 25 families. All had severe type I lissencephaly with grossly normal cerebellum and a distinctive facial appearance consisting of prominent forehead, bitemporal hollowing, short nose with upturned nares, protuberant upper lip, thin vermilion border, and small jaw. Several other abnormalities, especially growth deficiency, were frequent but not constant. Chromosome analysis showed deletion of band 17p13 in 14 of 25 MDS probands. RFLP and somatic cell hybrid studies using probes from the 17p13.3 region including pYNZ22 (D17S5), pYNH37 (D17S28), and p144-D6 (D17S34) detected deletions in 19 of 25 probands tested including seven in whom chromosome analysis was normal. When the cytogenetic and molecular data are combined, deletions were detected in 21 of 25 probands. Parental origin of de novo deletions was determined in 11 patients. Paternal origin occurred in seven and maternal origin in four. Our demonstration of cytogenetic or molecular deletions in 21 of 25 MDS probands proves that deletion of a ""critical region"" comprising two or more genetic loci within band 17p13.3 is the cause of the MDS phenotype. We suspect that the remaining patients have smaller deletions involving the proposed critical region which are not detected with currently available probes.",editorial
12621583,"Refinement of a 400-kb critical region allows genotypic differentiation between isolated lissencephaly, Miller-Dieker syndrome, and other phenotypes secondary to deletions of 17p13.3.","Deletions of 17p13.3, including the LIS1 gene, result in the brain malformation lissencephaly, which is characterized by reduced gyration and cortical thickening; however, the phenotype can vary from isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS) to Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS). At the clinical level, these two phenotypes can be differentiated by the presence of significant dysmorphic facial features and a more severe grade of lissencephaly in MDS. Previous work has suggested that children with MDS have a larger deletion than those with ILS, but the precise boundaries of the MDS critical region and causative genes other than LIS1 have never been fully determined. We have completed a physical and transcriptional map of the 17p13.3 region from LIS1 to the telomere. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have mapped the deletion size in 19 children with ILS, 11 children with MDS, and 4 children with 17p13.3 deletions not involving LIS1. We show that the critical region that differentiates ILS from MDS at the molecular level can be reduced to 400 kb. Using somatic cell hybrids from selected patients, we have identified eight genes that are consistently deleted in patients classified as having MDS. In addition, deletion of the genes CRK and 14-3-3 epsilon delineates patients with the most severe lissencephaly grade. On the basis of recent functional data and the creation of a mouse model suggesting a role for 14-3-3 epsilon in cortical development, we suggest that deletion of one or both of these genes in combination with deletion of LIS1 may contribute to the more severe form of lissencephaly seen only in patients with MDS.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
28301481,COLEC10 is mutated in 3MC patients and regulates early craniofacial development.,"3MC syndrome is an autosomal recessive heterogeneous disorder with features linked to developmental abnormalities. The main features include facial dysmorphism, craniosynostosis and cleft lip/palate; skeletal structures derived from cranial neural crest cells (cNCC). We previously reported that lectin complement pathway genes COLEC11 and MASP1/3 are mutated in 3MC syndrome patients. Here we define a new gene, COLEC10, also mutated in 3MC families and present novel mutations in COLEC11 and MASP1/3 genes in a further five families. The protein products of COLEC11 and COLEC10, CL-K1 and CL-L1 respectively, form heteromeric complexes. We show COLEC10 is expressed in the base membrane of the palate during murine embryo development. We demonstrate how mutations in COLEC10 (c.25C>T; p.Arg9Ter, c.226delA; p.Gly77Glufs*66 and c.528C>G p.Cys176Trp) impair the expression and/or secretion of CL-L1 highlighting their pathogenicity. Together, these findings provide further evidence linking the lectin complement pathway and complement factors COLEC11 and COLEC10 to morphogenesis of craniofacial structures and 3MC etiology.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
17848409,Compound heterozygosity for mutations in LMNA in a patient with a myopathic and lipodystrophic mandibuloacral dysplasia type A phenotype.,"Mandibuloacral dysplasia type A (MADA; OMIM 248370) is a rare progeroid syndrome characterized by dysmorphic craniofacial and skeletal features, lipodystrophy, and metabolic complications. Most Italian patients carry the same homozygous missense mutation (p.R527H) in the C-terminal tail domain of the LMNA gene, which encodes lamin A/C, an intermediate filament component of the nuclear envelope.The objective of the study was to identify novel LMNA mutations in individuals with clinical characteristics (bird-like facies, mandibular and clavicular hypoplasia, acroosteolysis, lipodystrophy, alopecia) observed in other well-known patients.The LMNA gene was sequenced. Functional properties of the mutant alleles were investigated.We report a 27-yr-old Italian woman showing a MADA-like phenotype. Features include a hypoplastic mandible, acroosteolysis, pointed nose, partial loss of sc fat, and a progeric appearance. Due to the absence of clavicular dysplasia and normal metabolic profiles, generally associated with muscle hyposthenia and generalized hypotonia, this phenotype can be considered an atypical laminopathy.We identified a patient compound heterozygote for the p.R527H and p.V440M alleles. The patient's cells showed nuclear shape abnormalities, accumulation of pre-lamin A, and irregular lamina thickness. Lamins A and C showed normal expression and localization. The electron microscopy detected heterochromatin defects with a pattern similar to those observed in other laminopathies. However, chromatin analysis showed a normal distribution pattern of the major heterochromatin proteins: heterochromatin protein-1beta and histone H3 methylated at lysine 9.The clinical and cellular features of this patient show overlapping laminopathy phenotypes that could be due to the combination of p.R527H and p.V440M alleles.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
16278265,"A homozygous mutation in the lamin A/C gene associated with a novel syndrome of arthropathy, tendinous calcinosis, and progeroid features.","CONTEXT: Mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene have been reported in a wide variety of disorders, including lipodystrophies, cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophies, neuropathy, mandibuloacral dysplasia, restrictive dermopathy, and progeria. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to carry out mutational analysis of LMNA in a patient with a novel syndrome of arthropathy, tendinous calcinosis, and progeroid features. DESIGN: The study design was a descriptive case report. SETTING: The study was performed at a referral center. PATIENT: A 44-yr-old male of European descent with an autosomal recessive arthropathy syndrome affecting predominantly the distal femora and proximal tibia in the knee with tendinous calcifications was studied. He also had progeroid features, such as pinched nose and micrognathia, cataract, alopecia, generalized lipodystrophy, and sclerodermatous skin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were mutational analysis of lamin A/C (LMNA) and its processing enzyme, zinc metalloproteinase (ZMPSTE24), as candidate genes. RESULTS: We found a homozygous nucleotide substitution, 1718C>T, in exon 11 of the LMNA gene, resulting in substitution of a well-conserved residue serine at position 573 with leucine (S573L). This missense mutation only affects lamin A, not lamin C, because the alternative splicing site is located in exon 10. Immunofluorescence staining of the nuclei from his skin fibroblasts showed occasional misshapen morphology. CONCLUSIONS: The S573L homozygous LMNA mutation is associated with a novel phenotype of arthropathy, tendinous calcifications, and progeroid features distinct from the acroosteolysis previously reported in patients with mandibuloacral dysplasia caused by LMNA or ZMPSTE24 mutations. Thus, arthropathy with tendinous calcifications can be added to the growing list of disorders associated with LMNA mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

All three had late-onset ataxia and retinal degeneration, adding to hearing loss, cognitive impairment, and dysotosis multiplex. One sibling also had psychosis. MRI revealed cerebellar atrophy and predominantly parieto-occipital white matter changes. MR spectroscopy showed no evidence for demyelination. It appears that the disabling course of adult alpha-mannosidosis is caused by lysosomal accumulation rather than demyelination.",journal article; case reports
19551947,Urinary metabolite quantification employing 2D NMR spectroscopy.,"Two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a fairly novel method for the quantification of metabolites in biological fluids and tissue extracts. We show in this contribution that, compared to 1D 1H spectra, superior quantification of human urinary metabolites is obtained from 2D 1H-13C heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra measured at natural abundance. This was accomplished by the generation of separate calibration curves for the different 2D HSQC signals of each metabolite. Lower limits of detection were in the low to mid micromolar range and were generally the lower the greater the number of methyl groups contained in an analyte. The quantitative 2D NMR data obtained for a selected set of 17 urinary metabolites were compared to those obtained independently by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of amino acids and hippurate as well as enzymatic and colorimetric measurements of creatinine. As a typical application, 2D-NMR was used for the investigation of urine from patients with inborn errors of metabolism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; evaluation studies; journal article"
28602422,Loss-of-Function Variants in MYLK Cause Recessive Megacystis Microcolon Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome.,"Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is a congenital disorder characterized by loss of smooth muscle contraction in the bladder and intestine. To date, three genes are known to be involved in MMIHS pathogenesis: ACTG2, MYH11, and LMOD1. However, for approximately 10% of affected individuals, the genetic cause of the disease is unknown, suggesting that other loci are most likely involved. Here, we report on three MMIHS-affected subjects from two consanguineous families with no variants in the known MMIHS-associated genes. By performing homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we found homozygous variants in myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) in both families. We identified a 7 bp duplication (c.3838_3844dupGAAAGCG [p.Glu1282_Glyfs∗51]) in one family and a putative splice-site variant (c.3985+5C>A) in the other. Expression studies and splicing assays indicated that both variants affect normal MYLK expression. Because MYLK encodes an important kinase required for myosin activation and subsequent interaction with actin filaments, it is likely that in its absence, contraction of smooth muscle cells is impaired. The existence of a conditional-Mylk-knockout mouse model with severe gut dysmotility and abnormal function of the bladder supports the involvement of this gene in MMIHS pathogenesis. In aggregate, our findings implicate MYLK as a gene involved in the recessive form of MMIHS, confirming that this disease of the visceral organs is heterogeneous with a myopathic origin.",brief-report; journal article
24105366,Mutations in SH3PXD2B cause Borrone dermato-cardio-skeletal syndrome.,"Borrone Dermato-Cardio-Skeletal (BDCS) syndrome is a severe progressive autosomal recessive disorder characterized by coarse facies, thick skin, acne conglobata, dysmorphic facies, vertebral abnormalities and mitral valve prolapse. We identified a consanguineous kindred with a child clinically diagnosed with BDCS. Linkage analysis of this family (BDCS1) identified five regions homozygous by descent with a maximum LOD score of 1.75. Linkage analysis of the family that originally defined BDCS (BDCS3) identified an overlapping linkage peak at chromosome 5q35.1. Sequence analysis identified two different homozygous mutations in BDCS1 and BDCS3, affecting the gene encoding the protein SH3 and PX domains 2B (SH3PXD2B), which localizes to 5q35.1. Western blot analysis of patient fibroblasts derived from affected individuals in both families demonstrated complete loss of SH3PXD2B. Homozygosity mapping and sequence analysis in a second published BDCS family (BDCS2) excluded SH3PXD2B. SH3PXD2B is required for the formation of functional podosomes, and loss-of-function mutations in SH3PXD2B have recently been shown to underlie 7 of 13 families with Frank-Ter Haar syndrome (FTHS). FTHS and BDCS share some overlapping clinical features; therefore, our results demonstrate that a proportion of BDCS and FTHS cases are allelic. Mutations in other gene(s) functioning in podosome formation and regulation are likely to underlie the SH3PXD2B-mutation-negative BDSC/FTHS patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
15523657,Further delineation of Frank-ter Haar syndrome.,"The combination of the symptoms megalocornea, multiple skeletal anomalies, and developmental delay was first recognized as a separate entity by Frank et al. and subsequently confirmed by ter Haar et al.

Protruding, simple ears, and prominent coccyx bone can be also regarded as important diagnostic signs. Inheritance most likely is autosomal recessive. Several manifestations such as progressive ""coarsening"" of the face, hirsutism, gallstones, lingual papillomatosis, and cardiac valve anomalies all point to a possible metabolic basis of the disorder.

24706940,Mutations in the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 cause Sedaghatian-type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia.,"BACKGROUND: Sedaghatian-type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (SSMD) is a neonatal lethal form of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia characterised by severe metaphyseal chondrodysplasia with mild limb shortening, platyspondyly, cardiac conduction defects, and central nervous system abnormalities. As part of the FORGE Canada Consortium we studied two unrelated families to identify the genetic aetiology of this rare disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole exome sequencing of a child affected with SSMD and her unaffected parents identified two rare variants in GPX4. The first (c.587+5G>A) was inherited from the mother, and the second (c.588-8_588-4del) was de novo (NM_001039848.1); both were predicted to impact splicing of GPX4. In vitro studies confirmed the mutations spliced out part of exon 4 and skipped exon 5, respectively, with both resulting in a frameshift and premature truncation of GPX4. Subsequently, a second child with SSMD was identified; although DNA from the child was not available, the two unaffected parents were found by Sanger sequencing to each carry the same heterozygous stop mutation in exon 3 of GPX4, c.381C>A, p.Tyr127* (NM_001039848.1). CONCLUSIONS: Our identification of truncating mutations in GPX4 in two families affected with SSMD supports the pathogenic role of mutated GPX4 in this very rare disease. GPX4 is a member of the glutathione peroxidase family of antioxidant defence enzymes and protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation. GPX4 is essential for early embryo development, regulating anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic activities. Our findings highlight the importance of this enzyme in development of the cardiac, nervous, and skeletal systems.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

Impaired immunity may result in increased mortality. AIMS:To follow a cohort of 120 CHH patients for mortality from 1971 to 1995. METHODS:The overall and cause specific disease mortality rates in patients with CHH, and the disease mortality rate in 194 parents and 158 non-affected sibs were compared with the national rates. RESULTS:During follow up seven disease related deaths were observed versus 0.8 expected (standardised mortality ratio 9.3, 95% confidence interval 3.7 to 19). In most cases, the deaths were confined to the younger age groups and associated with defective immunity. The mortality of the parents and the non-affected sibs was similar to that in the general population. CONCLUSION:The study confirms increased mortality in patients with CHH attributable to defective immunity, especially in children.",research-article; journal article

28285769,Mutations in the Spliceosome Component CWC27 Cause Retinal Degeneration with or without Additional Developmental Anomalies.,"Pre-mRNA splicing factors play a fundamental role in regulating transcript diversity both temporally and spatially. Genetic defects in several spliceosome components have been linked to a set of non-overlapping spliceosomopathy phenotypes in humans, among which skeletal developmental defects and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are frequent findings. Here we report that defects in spliceosome-associated protein CWC27 are associated with a spectrum of disease phenotypes ranging from isolated RP to severe syndromic forms. By whole-exome sequencing, recessive protein-truncating mutations in CWC27 were found in seven unrelated families that show a range of clinical phenotypes, including retinal degeneration, brachydactyly, craniofacial abnormalities, short stature, and neurological defects. Remarkably, variable expressivity of the human phenotype can be recapitulated in Cwc27 mutant mouse models, with significant embryonic lethality and severe phenotypes in the complete knockout mice while mice with a partial loss-of-function allele mimic the isolated retinal degeneration phenotype. Our study describes a retinal dystrophy-related phenotype spectrum as well as its genetic etiology and highlights the complexity of the spliceosomal gene network.",research-article; journal article

21998596,CtIP Mutations Cause Seckel and Jawad Syndromes.,"Seckel syndrome is a recessively inherited dwarfism disorder characterized by microcephaly and a unique head profile. Genetically, it constitutes a heterogeneous condition, with several loci mapped (SCKL1-5) but only three disease genes identified: the ATR, CENPJ, and CEP152 genes that control cellular responses to DNA damage. We previously mapped a Seckel syndrome locus to chromosome 18p11.31-q11.2 (SCKL2). Here, we report two mutations in the CtIP (RBBP8) gene within this locus that result in expression of C-terminally truncated forms of CtIP. We propose that these mutations are the molecular cause of the disease observed in the previously described SCKL2 family and in an additional unrelated family diagnosed with a similar form of congenital microcephaly termed Jawad syndrome. While an exonic frameshift mutation was found in the Jawad family, the SCKL2 family carries a splicing mutation that yields a dominant-negative form of CtIP. Further characterization of cell lines derived from the SCKL2 family revealed defective DNA damage induced formation of single-stranded DNA, a critical co-factor for ATR activation. Accordingly, SCKL2 cells present a lowered apoptopic threshold and hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Notably, over-expression of a comparable truncated CtIP variant in non-Seckel cells recapitulates SCKL2 cellular phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner. This work thus identifies CtIP as a disease gene for Seckel and Jawad syndromes and defines a new type of genetic disease mechanism in which a dominant negative mutation yields a recessively inherited disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26123727,WDR73 Mutations Cause Infantile Neurodegeneration and Variable Glomerular Kidney Disease.,"Infantile-onset cerebellar atrophy (CA) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous trait. Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GMS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, characterized by microcephaly with brain anomalies including CA in some cases, intellectual disability, and early-infantile-onset nephrotic syndrome. Very recently, WDR73 deficiency was identified as the cause of GMS in five individuals. To evaluate the role of WDR73 mutations as a cause of GMS and other forms of syndromic CA, we performed Sanger or exome sequencing in 51 unrelated patients with CA and variable brain anomalies and in 40 unrelated patients with a diagnosis of GMS. We identified 10 patients from three CA and from two GMS families with WDR73 mutations including the original family described with CA, mental retardation, optic atrophy, and skin abnormalities (CAMOS). There were five novel mutations, of which two were truncating and three were missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues. Individuals carrying homozygous WDR73 mutations mainly presented with a pattern of neurological and neuroimaging findings as well as intellectual disability, while kidney involvement was variable. We document postnatal onset of CA, a retinopathy, basal ganglia degeneration, and short stature as novel features of WDR73-related disease, and define WDR73-related disease as a new entity of infantile neurodegeneration.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

20301730,Mucolipidosis III Alpha/Beta,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Mucolipidosis alpha/beta (ML III alpha/beta; pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy), a slowly progressive disorder with clinical onset at approximately age three years, is characterized by slow growth rate and subnormal stature; radiographic evidence of mild to moderate dysostosis multiplex; joint stiffness and pain initially in the shoulders, hips, and fingers; gradual mild coarsening of facial features; and normal to mildly impaired cognitive development. If present, organomegaly is mild. Pain from osteoporosis that is clinically and radiologically apparent in childhood becomes more severe from adolescence. Cardiorespiratory complications (restrictive lung disease, thickening and insufficiency of the mitral and aortic valves, left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy) are common causes of death, typically in early to middle adulthood. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:In ML III alpha/beta the activity of nearly all lysosomal hydrolases is up to tenfold higher in plasma and other body fluids than in normal controls because of inadequate targeting to lysosomes. Urinary excretion of oligosaccharides (OSs), a nonspecific finding, is often excessive. Significant deficiency (1%-10% of normal) of the activity of the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: lysosomal hydrolase N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GNPTA), encoded by GNPTAB, confirms the diagnosis. Bidirectional sequencing of the entire GNPTAB coding region detects two pathogenic variants in more than 95% of individuals with ML III alpha/beta. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Low-impact physical therapy is usually well tolerated. Myringotomy tube placement may be indicated in the treatment of recurrent otitis media. Carpal tunnel signs may require tendon release. In late childhood or early adolescence symptomatic relief of hip pain may be initially accomplished with over-the-counter analgesics; in some older adolescents and adults with milder phenotypic variants, bilateral hip replacement has been successful. Later in the disease course management focuses on relief of general bone pain associated with osteoporosis, which has responded in a few individuals to scheduled intermittent IV administration of the bisphosphonate pamidronate. Prevention of secondary complications: Because of concerns about airway management, surgical intervention should be undertaken only in tertiary care settings with pediatric anesthesiologists and intensivists. Surveillance: Twice-yearly outpatient clinic visits for young children; annual routine follow-up visits after age six years unless bone pain, deteriorating ambulation, and/or cardiac and respiratory monitoring need more frequent attention. GENETIC COUNSELING:ML III alpha/beta is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.",book; review
10973263,Identification of the gene causing mucolipidosis type IV.,"Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorder characterized by psychomotor retardation and ophthalmological abnormalities including corneal opacities, retinal degeneration and strabismus. Most patients reach a maximal developmental level of 12?15 months. The disease was classified as a mucolipidosis following observations by electron microscopy indicating the lysosomal storage of lipids together with water-soluble, granulated substances. Over 80% of the MLIV patients diagnosed are Ashkenazi Jews, including severely affected and mildly affected patients. The gene causing MLIV was previously mapped to human chromosome 19p13.2-13.3 in a region of approximately 1 cM (ref. 7). Haplotype analysis in the MLIV gene region of over 70 MLIV Ashkenazi chromosomes indicated the existence of two founder chromosomes among 95% of the Ashkenazi MLIV families: a major haplotype in 72% and a minor haplotype in 23% of the MLIV chromosomes (ref. 7, and G.B., unpublished data). The remaining 5% are distinct haplotypes found only in single patients. The basic metabolic defect causing the lysosomal storage in MLIV has not yet been identified. Thus, positional cloning was an alternative to identify the MLIV gene. We report here the identification of a new gene in this human chromosomal region in which MLIV-specific mutations were identified.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

MLIV is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in MCOLN1, which encodes for mucolipin-1, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel family. Although approximately 70-80% of patients identified are Ashkenazi Jewish, MLIV is a pan-ethnic disorder. Importantly, while MLIV is thought to be a rare disease, its frequency may be greater than currently appreciated, for its common presentation as a cerebral palsy-like encephalopathy can lead to misdiagnosis. Moreover, patients with milder variants are often not recognized as having MLIV. This review provides an update on the ethnic distribution, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, methods of diagnosis, molecular genetics, differential diagnosis, and treatment of patients with MLIV. An enhanced awareness of the manifestations of this disorder may help to elucidate the true frequency and range of symptoms associated with MLIV, providing insight into the pathogenesis of this multi-system disease.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
11786056,Electronegative electroretinogram in mucolipidosis IV.,"OBJECTIVE:To demonstrate the progression of electroretinographic (ERG) findings in mucolipidosis IV. METHODS:Two patients with mucolipidosis IV were examined clinically and their condition was followed up for ophthalmic manifestations of the disease. Electroretinograms were performed on both patients, and conjunctival biopsy specimens were analyzed for characteristic ultrastructural inclusion bodies using light and electron microscopy. Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood was screened for 2 major founder mutations in the ML4 gene using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. Haplotypes were confirmed by automated sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. RESULTS:In patient 1, an ERG obtained at 12 months of age showed mildly subnormal amplitude of rod-mediated and cone-mediated responses and significantly prolonged rod and cone b-wave implicit times. An ERG obtained when the patient was 6.6 years old disclosed marked progression with greater loss of b-wave than a-wave responses to rod-and-cone-mediated activity. Scotopic ERG at the highest intensity was electronegative in configuration. In patient 2, ERG showed minimal rod-mediated responses, severely subnormal cone-mediated responses, and prolonged cone b-wave implicit times. Again, electronegative configuration of the scotopic bright flash response indicated greater disturbance of b-wave generators. CONCLUSIONS:Novel ERG findings in 2 cases of mucolipidosis IV are reported with associated clinical courses, histopathologic abnormality, and genetic studies. In both cases ERGs demonstrate an electronegative configuration, suggesting that the primary retinal disturbance in mucolipidosis IV may occur at or proximal to the photoreceptor terminals.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
24602160,Burden of disease in patients with Morquio A syndrome: results from an international patient-reported outcomes survey.,"BACKGROUND:Morquio A syndrome (or mucopolysaccharidosis IVa) is an ultra-rare multi-organ disease, resulting in significantly impaired functional capacity, mobility and quality of life (QoL). METHODS:This patient-reported outcomes survey evaluated the global burden of Morquio A among adults (≥18 years, N = 27) and children (7-17 years, N = 36), including the impact on mobility, QoL, pain and fatigue. QoL was assessed using the general Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) questionnaire (the EuroQol [EQ]-5D-5L). Pain and pain interference with daily activities were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) in adults and the Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool (APPT) in children. Fatigue was assessed by questioning the patients on the number of evenings in a week they felt extremely tired. RESULTS:The clinical data showed a wide heterogeneity in clinical manifestations between patients, with the majority of patients showing differing levels of endurance, short stature, bone and joint abnormalities, abnormal gait and eye problems. Mobility was considerably impaired: 44.4% of children and 85.2% of adult patients were using a wheelchair. High wheelchair reliance significantly reduced QoL. This was mainly driven by reduced scores in the Mobility, Self-care, and Usual Activity domains. The HRQoL utility values were 0.846, 0.582 and 0.057 respectively in adults not using a wheelchair, using a wheelchair only when needed and always using a wheelchair; values were 0.534, 0.664 and -0.180 respectively in children. Employed adult patients had a better HRQoL than unemployed patients (HRQoL utility value 0.640 vs. 0.275, respectively).64% of children and 74% of adult patients had joint pain; fatigue was reported by 69% of children and 63% of adults. Overall, increased mobility was associated with more severe and widespread pain and more fatigue. CONCLUSIONS:The HRQoL of Morquio A patients is mainly driven by the ability to remain independently mobile without becoming wheelchair dependent. Their QoL reduces dramatically if they always have to use their wheelchair. Even a slightly better mobility (wheelchair use only when needed) greatly improves QoL. Maintenance of functional capacity and mobility paired with better pain management are likely to improve QoL.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

3930842,Biotinidase deficiency: factors responsible for the increased biotin requirement.,Inability to recycle biotin from endogenous biocytin in congenital biotinidase deficiency is associated with increased requirement of exogenous free biotin. We have observed that severe biotin depletion with clinical and biochemical consequences occurs within 12 days after birth in a newborn patient and within 15-20 days after withdrawal of biotin supplementation in four other patients. Our studies have shown that: Urinary loss of biotin and biocytin are major causes for this rapid biotin depletion. Intestinal absorption of biotin seems to be normal at least at the loading dose of 1.5 micrograms/kg. At normal or subnormal plasma biotin concentrations biocytin is found in low concentrations (below 1 nmol l-1) in plasma of patients but at much higher concentrations in urine (100-600 nmol l-1). An oral load of biocytin results in patients in unchanged biotin levels but in a marked rise of biocytin in plasma followed by rapid renal excretion of biocytin whereas in controls biotin levels in plasma increase rapidly and biocytin remains below detection levels.,research-article; journal article

We describe a white family with two siblings affected with congenital hypotonia early-onset glaucoma, and psychomotor delays. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) showed hydrocephalus, bilateral frontal polymicrogyria, abnormal cerebellum, and characteristic flattened dystrophic pons. We identified novel POMGnT1 gene alterations in this family. Both affected siblings were found to be compound hetrozygotes and carried two missense changes inherited from their mother and one missense change (p.R442C) inherited from their father. Our findings further define the phenotypic spectrum of MEB and its occurrence in the US population.",journal article
12011280,"Collagen VI involvement in Ullrich syndrome: a clinical, genetic, and immunohistochemical study.","BACKGROUND:Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) is a form of merosin-positive congenital muscular dystrophy characterized by proximal contractures, distal laxity, rigidity of the spine, and respiratory complications. Recently, a deficiency of collagen VI on muscle and skin biopsy together with recessive mutations in the collagen 6A2 gene were reported in three families with UCMD. However, the clinical spectrum, frequency, and level of heterogeneity of this disorder are not known. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:The authors studied 15 patients (aged 3 to 23.6 years) with a clinical diagnosis of UCMD. Linkage analysis to the three collagen VI genes was performed in all informative families (n = 7), whereas immunohistochemical analysis of collagen VI expression in muscle was performed in the remaining cases. RESULTS:An immunocytochemical reduction of collagen VI was observed in six patients. Three of the six patients belonged to informative families, and haplotype analysis clearly suggested linkage to the COL6A1/2 locus in two cases and to the COL6A3 loci in the third case. In the remaining nine patients, primary collagen VI involvement was excluded based on either the linkage analysis (four families) or considered unlikely based on normal immunolabeling of collagen VI. Age and presentation at onset, the distribution and severity of weakness and contractures, and the frequency of nonambulant patients were similar in the patients with and without collagen VI involvement. Distal laxity, rigidity of the spine, scoliosis, failure to thrive, and early and severe respiratory impairment were found in all patients by the end of the first decade of life, irrespective of their maximum motor functional ability or their collagen status. CONCLUSIONS:These results suggest that collagen VI involvement is relatively common in UCMD (40%); however, the role of this molecule was excluded in a number of cases, suggesting genetic heterogeneity of this condition.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16258657,Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy: clinical and genetic heterogeneity.,"UNLABELLED:Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD), due to mutations in the collagen VI genes, is an autosomal recessive form of CMD, commonly associated with distal joints hyperlaxity and severe course. A mild or moderate involvement can be occasionally observed. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the clinical picture of CMD patients with Ullrich phenotype who presented decreased or absent collagen VI immunoreactivity on muscular biopsy. RESULTS:Among 60 patients with CMD, two had no expression of collagen V and their clinical involvement was essentially different: the first (3 years of follow-up) has mild motor difficulty; the second (8 years of follow-up) never acquired walking and depends on ventilatory support. A molecular study, performed by Pan et al. at the Thomas Jefferson University, demonstrated in the first a known mutation of Bethlem myopathy in COL6A1 and in the second the first dominantly acting mutation in UCMD and the first in COL6A1, previously associated only to Bethlem myopathy, with benign course and dominant inheritance. CONCLUSION:Bethlem myopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of UCMD, even in patients without fingers contractures; overlap between Ullrich and Bethlem phenotypes can be supposed.",journal article; case reports

23589569,MPN patients harbor recurrent truncating mutations in transcription factor NF-E2.,"The molecular etiology of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) remains incompletely understood, despite recent advances incurred through the discovery of several different mutations in MPN patients. We have recently described overexpression of the transcription factor NF-E2 in MPN patients and shown that elevated NF-E2 levels in vivo cause an MPN phenotype and predispose to leukemic transformation in transgenic mice. We report the presence of acquired insertion and deletion mutations in the NF-E2 gene in MPN patients. These result in truncated NF-E2 proteins that enhance wild-type (WT) NF-E2 function and cause erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis in a murine model. NF-E2 mutant cells acquire a proliferative advantage, witnessed by clonal dominance over WT NF-E2 cells in MPN patients. Our data underscore the role of increased NF-E2 activity in the pathophysiology of MPNs.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
7436463,Familial myelofibrosis.,"Two siblings developed a fulminant fatal myeloproliferative disease at 7 and 8 weeks of age. The illness presented with pallor, haemorrhagic symptoms, and hepatosplenomegaly, and the blood picture was that of pancytopenia and leucoerythroblastosis. Bone marrow histology showed reduced haemopoiesis with generalised fibrosis. Histiocytes were present, but haemophagocytosis was not prominent. There was evidence of extramedullary haemopoiesis in the spleen, with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate of other organs. The condition closely resembles acute idiopathic myelofibrosis of infancy, but the early onset with severe pancytopenia and the histological appearances may arouse suspicion of the possible familial nature of the condition. Although clinically resembling familial haemophagocytic reticulosis, the uncharacteristic bone marrow, liver, and spleen histology serve to exclude this diagnosis.",editorial

In skin, LB have been reported in either eccrine sweat glands or in apocrine sweat glands. The disease is caused by mutations in either the EPM2A gene or in a second yet-unknown gene.

22114105,Defective NDUFA9 as a novel cause of neonatally fatal complex I disease.,"BACKGROUND:Mitochondrial disorders are associated with abnormalities of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and cause significant morbidity and mortality in the population. The extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity of these disorders due to a broad variety of mutations in several hundreds of candidate genes, encoded by either the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA (nDNA), impedes a straightforward genetic diagnosis. A new disease gene is presented here, identified in a single Kurdish patient born from consanguineous parents with neonatally fatal Leigh syndrome and complex I deficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS:Using homozygosity mapping and subsequent positional candidate gene analysis, a total region of 255.8 Mb containing 136 possible mitochondrial genes was identified. A pathogenic mutation was found in the complex I subunit encoding the NDUFA9 gene, changing a highly conserved arginine at position 321 to proline. This is the first disease-causing mutation ever reported for NDUFA9. Complex I activity was restored in fibroblasts of the patient by lentiviral transduction with wild type but not mutant NDUFA9, confirming that the mutation causes the complex I deficiency and related disease. CONCLUSIONS:The data show that homozygosity mapping and candidate gene analysis remain an efficient way to detect mutations even in small consanguineous pedigrees with OXPHOS deficiency, especially when the enzyme deficiency in fibroblasts allows appropriate candidate gene selection and functional complementation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
8571951,Atelosteogenesis type II is caused by mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulfate-transporter gene (DTDST): evidence for a phenotypic series involving three chondrodysplasias.,"Atelosteogenesis type II (AO II) is a neonatally lethal chondrodysplasia whose clinical and histological characteristics resemble those of another chondrodysplasia, the much less severe diastrophic dysplasia (DTD). The similarity suggests a shared pathogenesis involving lesions in the same biochemical pathway and perhaps the same gene. DTD is caused by mutations in the recently identified diastrophic dysplasia sulfate-transporter gene (DTDST). Here, we report that AOII patients also have DTDST mutations, which lead to defective uptake of inorganic sulfate and insufficient sulfation of macromolecules by patient mesenchymal cells in vitro. Together with our recent observation that a third even more severe chondrodysplasia, achondrogenesis type IB, is also caused by mutations in DTDST, these results demonstrate a phenotypic series of three chondrodysplasias of increasing severity caused by lesions in a single sulfate-transporter gene. The severity of the phenotype appears to be correlated with the predicted effect of the mutations on the residual activity of the DTDST protein.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
15316973,Diastrophic dysplasia and atelosteogenesis type II as expression of compound heterozygosis: first report of a Mexican patient and genotype-phenotype correlation.,"The osteochondrodysplasias represent a heterogeneous group of cartilage and bone diseases. Among these, achondrogenesis 1B, atelosteogenesis type II, diastrophic dysplasia, and autosomal recessive multiple epiphyseal dysplasia are caused by mutations in the solute carrier family 26 (sulfate transporter), member 2 gene (SLC26A2). This group of osteochondrodysplasias shows a continuous spectrum of clinical variability and shares many features in common. Usually, it is difficult to distinguish clinically among these patients. To date, several efforts have been made to correlate mutations in the SLC26A2 gene with phenotypic severity in the patients. We report on a Mexican girl with diastrophic dysplasia presenting some unusual clinical and radiographic features that are usually observed in atelosteogenesis type II. Molecular analysis of the SLC26A2 gene in this patient showed compound heterozygosity for the R178X and R279W mutations. In this patient, the combination of a mild and a severe mutation has apparently led to an intermediate or transitional clinical picture, showing an apparent genotype-phenotype correlation.",journal article; case reports
8725271,Cathepsin A deficiency in galactosialidosis: studies of patients and carriers in 16 families.,"Deficiency of lysosomal protective protein/cathepsin A in humans is the primary cause of galactosialidosis, a lysosomal storage disease characterized by combined deficiency of beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase. We have investigated 20 galactosialidosis patients and nine of their obligate heterozygous parents. A group of 12 patients with the early infantile type of the disease exhibited practically complete absence of cathepsin A activity, whereas eight patients with either the late infantile or the juvenile/adult type had 2-5% residual activity. Highest levels (5%) were present in two patients with milder clinical manifestations and later onset of the disease. In most fibroblast strains, beta-galactosidase activity was 10-15% of normal levels, whereas neuraminidase was reduced to less than 4%. Interestingly, a substantial residual activity (10%) of the latter enzyme was detected in the patient with the mildest phenotype and the highest cathepsin A activity. Heterozygous values for cathepsin A were reduced on average to half of normal levels. However, in two cell strains, the activity was far below control range, and in these cases, neuraminidase activity was severely depressed. Finally, we showed that cathepsin A had considerable activity in chorionic villi and amniocytes, but was deficient in amniocytes from a pregnancy with an affected fetus, indicating the relevance of cathepsin A assay for prenatal diagnosis of galactosialidosis.",journal article
23915561,Galactosialidosis: review and analysis of CTSA gene mutations.,"Mutations in the CTSA gene, that encodes the protective protein/cathepsin A or PPCA, lead to the secondary deficiency of Î²-galactosidase (GLB1) and neuraminidase 1 (NEU1), causing the lysosomal storage disorder galactosialidosis (GS). Few clinical cases of GS have been reported in the literature, the majority of them belonging to the juvenile/adult group of patients.The correct nomenclature of mutations for this gene is discussed through the analysis of the three PPCA/CTSA isoforms available in the GenBank database. Phenotype-genotype correlation has been assessed by computational analysis and review of previously reported single amino acid substitutions.We report the clinical and mutational analyses of four cases with the rare infantile form of GS. We identified three novel nucleotide changes, two of them resulting in the missense mutations, c.347A>G (p.His116Arg), c.775T>C (p.Cys259Arg), and the third, c.1216C>T, resulting in the p.Gln406* stop codon, a type of mutation identified for the first time in GS. An Italian founder effect of the c.114delG mutation can be suggested according to the origin of the only three patients carrying this mutation reported here and in the literature.In early reports mutations nomenclature was selected according to all CTSA isoforms (three different isoforms), thus generating a lot of confusion. In order to assist physicians in the interpretation of detected mutations, we mark the correct nomenclature for CTSA mutations. The complexity of pathology caused by the multifunctions of CTSA, and the very low numbers of mutations (only 23 overall) in relation to the length of the CTSA gene are discussed.In addition, the in silico functional predictions of all reported missense mutations allowed us to closely predict the early infantile, late infantile and juvenile phenotypes, also disclosing different degrees of severity in the juvenile phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article"
3378364,Niemann-Pick disease group C: clinical variability and diagnosis based on defective cholesterol esterification. A collaborative study on 70 patients.,"Seventy patients were selected to cover the range of variability in clinical expression of Niemann-Pick disease group C (NP-C). Their individual main clinical features and course of the disease (age at discovery and type of visceromegaly, age at onset and first neurological manifestation, later neurological symptoms) are schematically described. In cultured skin fibroblasts from these patients, sphingomyelinase activities measured in vitro showed decreased values only in approximately half of the cases, and when the metabolic fate of [14C]-sphingomyelin was studied in living cell cultures, still 20% of the cases had a normal hydrolysis rate. Esterification of exogenous cholesterol was investigated in cell lines from these and 5 additional patients and in 21 of their parents. Using a non-lipoprotein [3H]cholesterol source, very low esterification rates were obtained in more than 90% of the cases. All the numerous other pathological conditions studied, including Niemann-Pick disease types A and B, gave normal results. A more sensitive method was elaborated, in which the cells were challenged with pure human low density lipoproteins (LDL) and the early rate of esterification studied. With the latter procedure, a pronounced deficiency could also be demonstrated in the few cases which had shown a milder impairment using a [3H]cholesterol source, and intermediate rates of esterification were obtained in heterozygotes. Discrimination of these difficult cases and of heterozygotes could also be achieved replacing LDL with total unfrozen human serum. Correlations were established between given clinical phenotypes and the severity of the biochemical lesion. Defective intracellular cholesterol esterification is further established as an intrinsic feature of NP-C, and demonstration of this metabolic alteration appears as a major advance in diagnosing the condition.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
10973257,Autosomal recessive lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia is associated with human RELN mutations.,"Normal development of the cerebral cortex requires long-range migration of cortical neurons from proliferative regions deep in the brain. Lissencephaly (""smooth brain,"" from ""lissos,"" meaning smooth, and ""encephalos,"" meaning brain) is a severe developmental disorder in which neuronal migration is impaired, leading to a thickened cerebral cortex whose normally folded contour is simplified and smooth. Two identified lissencephaly genes do not account for all known cases, and additional lissencephaly syndromes have been described. An autosomal recessive form of lissencephaly (LCH) associated with severe abnormalities of the cerebellum, hippocampus and brainstem maps to chromosome 7q22, and is associated with two independent mutations in the human gene encoding reelin (RELN). The mutations disrupt splicing of RELN cDNA, resulting in low or undetectable amounts of reelin protein. LCH parallels the reeler mouse mutant (Reln(rl)), in which Reln mutations cause cerebellar hypoplasia, abnormal cerebral cortical neuronal migration and abnormal axonal connectivity. RELN encodes a large (388 kD) secreted protein that acts on migrating cortical neurons by binding to the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2; refs 9-11 ), alpha3beta1 integrin and protocadherins. Although reelin was previously thought to function exclusively in brain, some humans with RELN mutations show abnormal neuromuscular connectivity and congenital lymphoedema, suggesting previously unsuspected functions for reelin in and outside of the brain.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

19559398,WNT10A mutations are a frequent cause of a broad spectrum of ectodermal dysplasias with sex-biased manifestation pattern in heterozygotes.,"Odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia (OODD), a rare autosomal-recessive inherited form of ectodermal dysplasia including severe oligodontia, nail dystrophy, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, and hyperhidrosis, was recently shown to be caused by a homozygous nonsense WNT10A mutation in three consanguineous Lebanese families. Here, we report on 12 patients, from 11 unrelated families, with ectodermal dysplasia caused by five previously undescribed WNT10A mutations. In this study, we show that (1) WNT10A mutations cause not only OODD but also other forms of ectodermal dysplasia, reaching from apparently monosymptomatic severe oligodontia to Schöpf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome, which is so far considered a unique entity by the findings of numerous cysts along eyelid margins and the increased risk of benign and malignant skin tumors; (2) WNT10A mutations are a frequent cause of ectodermal dysplasia and were found in about 9% of an unselected patient cohort; (3) about half of the heterozygotes (53.8%) show a phenotype manifestation, including mainly tooth and nail anomalies, which was not reported before in OODD; and (4) heterozygotes show a sex-biased manifestation pattern, with a significantly higher proportion of tooth anomalies in males than in females, which may implicate gender-specific differences of WNT10A expression.",brief-report; journal article
22883145,TCTN3 mutations cause Mohr-Majewski syndrome.,"Orofaciodigital syndromes (OFDSs) consist of a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by abnormalities in the oral cavity, face, and digits and associated phenotypic abnormalities that lead to the delineation of 13 OFDS subtypes. Here, by a combined approach of homozygozity mapping and exome ciliary sequencing, we identified truncating TCTN3 mutations as the cause of an extreme form of OFD associated with bone dysplasia, tibial defect, cystic kidneys, and brain anomalies (OFD IV, Mohr-Majewski syndrome). Analysis of 184 individuals with various ciliopathies (OFD, Meckel, Joubert, and short rib polydactyly syndromes) led us to identify four additional truncating TCTN3 mutations in unrelated fetal cases with overlapping Meckel and OFD IV syndromes and one homozygous missense mutation in a family with Joubert syndrome. By exploring roles of TCTN3 in human ciliary related functions, we found that TCTN3 is necessary for transduction of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, as revealed by abnormal processing of GLI3 in patient cells. These results are consistent with the suggested role of its murine ortholog, which forms a complex at the ciliary transition zone with TCTN1 and TCTN2, both of which are also implicated in the transduction of SHH signaling. Overall, our data show the involvement of the transition zone protein TCTN3 in the regulation of the key SHH signaling pathway and that its disruption causes a severe form of ciliopathy, combining features of Meckel and OFD IV syndromes.","comparative study; brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
21282188,Mutations in PPIB (cyclophilin B) delay type I procollagen chain association and result in perinatal lethal to moderate osteogenesis imperfecta phenotypes.,"Recessive mutations in the cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), leucine proline-enriched proteoglycan 1 (LEPRE1) and peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) genes result in phenotypes that range from lethal in the perinatal period to severe deforming osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). These genes encode CRTAP (encoded by CRTAP), prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1; encoded by LEPRE1) and cyclophilin B (CYPB; encoded by PPIB), which reside in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and can form a complex involved in prolyl 3-hydroxylation in type I procollagen. CYPB, a prolyl cis-trans isomerase, has been thought to drive the prolyl-containing peptide bonds to the trans configuration needed for triple helix formation. Here, we describe mutations in PPIB identified in cells from three individuals with OI. Cultured dermal fibroblasts from the most severely affected infant make some overmodified type I procollagen molecules. Proα1(I) chains are slow to assemble into trimers, and abnormal procollagen molecules concentrate in the RER, and bind to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and prolyl 4-hydroxylase 1 (P4H1). These findings suggest that although CYPB plays a role in helix formation another effect is on folding of the C-terminal propeptide and trimer formation. The extent of procollagen accumulation and PDI/P4H1 binding differs among cells with mutations in PPIB, CRTAP and LEPRE1 with the greatest amount in PPIB-deficient cells and the least in LEPRE1-deficient cells. These findings suggest that prolyl cis-trans isomerase may be required to effectively fold the proline-rich regions of the C-terminal propeptide to allow proα chain association and suggest an order of action for CRTAP, P3H1 and CYPB in procollagen biosynthesis and pathogenesis of OI.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
30532310,Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis - A Case Series from India.,"Background:Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare auto-inflammatory disease of the bone. It tends to be multifocal and usually the symptoms tend to run for months and years before diagnosis is usually made. The objective of our study was to understand the clinical presentation and short-term response to treatment of CRMO patients. Materials and Methods:A retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with CRMO between 2011 and 2016 was done. Case records of these were retrospectively reviewed for clinical features, investigations and treatment received. Results:Six patients were diagnosed with CRMO. The median age of onset and time to diagnosis from onset of symptoms was 8 and 3.5 years respectively. Lower limb bones were the most commonly involved. Conclusions:There is significant delay in diagnosis of CRMO and this could be because of a lack of awareness of this condition amongst clinicians. Our case series with only male affection is rather unique as compared to other case series reported in medical literature which tend to have more female predilection. Pain with or without swelling was the most common symptom. Most of patients responded to combination therapy.",research-article; journal article
23666469,Update on oxalate crystal disease.,"Oxalate arthropathy is a rare cause of arthritis characterized by deposition of calcium oxalate crystals within synovial fluid. This condition typically occurs in patients with underlying primary or secondary hyperoxaluria. Primary hyperoxaluria constitutes a group of genetic disorders resulting in endogenous overproduction of oxalate, whereas secondary hyperoxaluria results from gastrointestinal disorders associated with fat malabsorption and increased absorption of dietary oxalate. In both conditions, oxalate crystals can deposit in the kidney leading to renal failure. Since oxalate is primarily renally eliminated, it accumulates throughout the body in renal failure, a state termed oxalosis. Affected organs can include bones, joints, heart, eyes, and skin. Since patients can present with renal failure and oxalosis before the underlying diagnosis of hyperoxaluria has been made, it is important to consider hyperoxaluria in patients who present with unexplained soft tissue crystal deposition. The best treatment of oxalosis is prevention. If patients present with advanced disease, treatment of oxalate arthritis consists of symptom management and control of the underlying disease process.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
10094443,5-Oxoprolinuria in patients with and without defects in the gamma-glutamyl cycle.,"UNLABELLED:In patients with defects in the synthesis, breakdown and metabolism of glutathione (GSH), like glutathione synthetase deficiency (GSD) and 5-oxoprolinase deficiency, urinary excretion of 5-oxoproline, an intermediate of the gamma-glutamyl cycle, is increased. We identified 20 patients with significantly elevated urinary excretion of 5-oxoproline (> or =150 mmol/mol creatinine) during 5 years of selective screening for organic acidurias. In 6 of them, 5-oxoprolinuria was a constant finding including three patients with GSD and one with 5-oxoprolinase deficiency. One patient with constant 5-oxoprolinuria had GM2 gangliosidosis and one was clinically unaffected. In 14 patients, 5-oxoprolinuria was a transient abnormality and most often associated with an inborn error of metabolism outside the gamma-glutamyl cycle. In 9 of them 5-oxoprolinuria was associated with a neonatal urea cycle defect, with tyrosinaemia type I or occurred during metabolic decompensation in propionic acidaemia or methylmalonic acidaemia. Additionally, transient 5-oxoprolinuria was associated with homocystinuria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, paracetamol intoxication, vigabatrin medication or extreme prematurity. CONCLUSION:5-Oxoprolinuria is a more common condition than hitherto thought and is primarily associated with defects in the gamma-glutamyl cycle. However, several other inborn errors of metabolism and pathophysiological conditions must be taken into account when discovering 5-oxoprolinuria.",journal article
25416932,Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome: metaphyseal chondrodysplasia in children with pancreatic insufficiency and neutropenia.,"Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (OMIM 260400) was identified in 1964 by pediatricians Harry Shwachman, a leader in cystic fibrosis, and Louis K. Diamond, a hematologist, along with pediatrician and morbid anatomist Martin Bodian. Initially the syndrome's clinical presentation included exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (lipomatous replacement of the pancreas) and neutropenia. In 1967 skeletal changes of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia were also described, completing the triad of findings; these abnormalities are present in all affected children and should be viewed as an integral feature of the syndrome, also called Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.",review; journal article
8301648,Diagnostic criteria and genetics of the PEHO syndrome.,"The PEHO syndrome (progressive encephalopathy with oedema, hypsarrhythmia, and optic atrophy) is a recently recognised disorder of unknown biochemical background. Diagnostic features have been found in neuroradiological and neuropathological studies, which show characteristic severe cerebellar atrophy. In combined neuroradiological and ophthalmological studies, 10 out of 21 possible PEHO patients fulfilled the criteria for true PEHO syndrome. All were abnormal at birth showing hypotonia, drowsiness, or poor feeding. Head circumference was normal, but usually dropped to 2 SD below average during the first year of life. Visual fixation was either absent from birth or lost during the first months of life. Nine patients had peripheral oedema in early childhood. The mean age of onset of infantile spasms was 4.9 months. All patients were extremely hypotonic and no motor milestones were reached. Patellar reflexes were brisk. Brain stem and somatosensory evoked potentials were abnormal in each case studied, cortical responses of somatosensory evoked potentials could not be elicited, and motor conduction velocities became delayed with age. Altogether 19 PEHO patients were found in 14 Finnish families. Autosomal recessive inheritance is likely.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

28335020,"ZNHIT3 is defective in PEHO syndrome, a severe encephalopathy with cerebellar granule neuron loss.","Progressive encephalopathy with oedema, hypsarrhythmia, and optic atrophy (PEHO) syndrome is an early childhood onset, severe autosomal recessive encephalopathy characterized by extreme cerebellar atrophy due to almost total granule neuron loss. By combining homozygosity mapping in Finnish families with Sanger sequencing of positional candidate genes and with exome sequencing a homozygous missense substitution of leucine for serine at codon 31 in ZNHIT3 was identified as the primary cause of PEHO syndrome. ZNHIT3 encodes a nuclear zinc finger protein previously implicated in transcriptional regulation and in small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle assembly and thus possibly to pre-ribosomal RNA processing. The identified mutation affects a highly conserved amino acid residue in the zinc finger domain of ZNHIT3. Both knockdown and genome editing of znhit3 in zebrafish embryos recapitulate the patients' cerebellar defects, microcephaly and oedema. These phenotypes are rescued by wild-type, but not mutant human ZNHIT3 mRNA, suggesting that the patient missense substitution causes disease through a loss-of-function mechanism. Transfection of cell lines with ZNHIT3 expression vectors showed that the PEHO syndrome mutant protein is unstable. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse cerebellar tissue demonstrated ZNHIT3 to be expressed in proliferating granule cell precursors, in proliferating and post-mitotic granule cells, and in Purkinje cells. Knockdown of Znhit3 in cultured mouse granule neurons and ex vivo cerebellar slices indicate that ZNHIT3 is indispensable for granule neuron survival and migration, consistent with the zebrafish findings and patient neuropathology. These results suggest that loss-of-function of a nuclear regulator protein underlies PEHO syndrome and imply that establishment of its spatiotemporal interaction targets will be the basis for developing therapeutic approaches and for improved understanding of cerebellar development.",journal article

Neuropathology of the progressive encephalopathy syndrome with edema, hypsarrhythmia and optic atrophy (the PEHO syndrome).","Uniform neuropathological changes are described in eight cases of the progressive encephalopathy syndrome with edema, hypsarrhythmia and optic atrophy (PEHO syndrome). Two of the autopsied patients were sisters and two other cases were familial. Macroscopically, cerebral and pronounced cerebellar atrophy was seen, the essential histopathological lesions being confined to the cerebellar cortex and the optic nerve. There was a severe neuronal loss in the inner granular layer of the cerebellum. The Purkinje cells were relatively preserved in number although reduced in size, deformed and slightly disaligned. Their dendrites were horizontally oriented and the proximal axons contained abundant torpedoes. The molecular layer was narrow. The optic nerves were atrophic. Serial neuroimaging studies showed that the disease process is operative during the postnatal period, although a prenatal onset cannot be excluded. An aberrant expression of immunoreactivity against the 200-kDa neurofilament polypeptide in Purkinje cell perikarya indicated disorganization of the cytoskeleton of these cells. The combination of clinical and pathological features of our patients differs from that observed in the few published cases of so-called primary degeneration of the granular layer. Infantile cerebello-optic atrophy, clinically characterized by seizures, blindness and early arrest in psychomotor development, thus seems to constitute a new autosomal recessive disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
8335020,Antibody deficiency and isolated growth hormone deficiency in a girl with Mulibrey nanism.,"A combination of humoral immunodeficiency and isolated growth hormone deficiency was observed in a girl with Mulibrey nanism. The humoral immunodeficiency consisted of subnormal concentration of serum IgG, in particular IgG2 and IgG4, and low concentration of serum IgM. Serum IgA and IgD were elevated, IgE was absent. Antibody response in vivo was very low or absent and opsonization in vitro was defective. Total B-cell number was low. In addition, the serum kappa/lambda light chain ratios within the immunoglobulin classes G, A, and M were abnormal. The defective antibody response may be linked to the abnormal kappa/lambda light chain ratios. Endocrine functions were normal except for isolated growth hormone deficiency. Therapy with human growth hormone resulted in increased growth velocity but did not improve humoral immune functions.",journal article; case reports
17285242,Genetic heterogeneity of megaloblastic anaemia type 1 in Tunisian patients.,"Megaloblastic anaemia 1 (MGA1) is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by selective intestinal vitamin B12 malabsorption and proteinuria. More than 200 MGA1 patients have been identified worldwide, but the disease is relatively prevalent in Finland, Norway and several Eastern Mediterranean regions. MGA1 is genetically heterogeneous and can be caused by mutations in either the cubilin (CUBN) or the amnionless (AMN) gene. In the present study we investigated the molecular defect underlying MGA1 in nine Tunisian patients belonging to six unrelated consanguineous families. Haplotype and linkage analyses, using microsatellite markers surrounding both CUBN and AMN genes, indicated that four out of the six families were likely to be linked to the CUBN gene. Patients from these families were screened for the Finnish, Mediterranean and Arabian mutations already published. None of the screened mutations could be detected in our population. One family showed a linkage to AMN gene. Direct screening of the AMN gene allowed the identification of the c.208-2A>G mutation, previously described in a Jewish Israeli patient of Tunisian origin and in Turkish patients. This suggests that the c.208-2A>G mutation may derive from a single Mediterranean founder ancestor. For the last family, haplotype analysis excluded both CUBN and AMN genes, suggesting the existence of a third locus that may cause MGA1.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
8162013,Molecular genetics of the persistent müllerian duct syndrome: a study of 19 families.,"A rare form of familial male pseudohermaphroditism, the persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS) is characterized by persistence of uterus and Fallopian tubes in 46,XY phenotypic males and is ascribed to defects in the synthesis or action of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). Biologically, PMDS is heterogeneous: in some cases, bioactive AMH is normally expressed by testicular tissue while, in others, no AMH is produced, suggesting the possibility of an AMH gene mutation, several of which have already been described. Molecular analysis of the AMH gene has now been performed in 21 additional patients and their families. In 6 patients, with normal serum concentration of AMH, the AMH gene was normal or contained only polymorphisms and silent mutations, supporting the hypothesis that the condition is due to end-organ resistance. Nine novel mutations were discovered in the remaining subjects, with low or undetectable levels of serum AMH. These mutations, when present in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, were associated with the PMDS phenotype, the same mutation never being observed in two different families. The three first exons of the AMH gene appear particularly mutation-prone, although they are less GC rich than the 2 last ones and code for the N-terminal part of the AMH protein, which is not in itself essential to bioactivity.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

11760020,A novel mutation in the anti-müllerian hormone gene as cause of persistent müllerian duct syndrome.,"UNLABELLED:Persistent müllerian duct syndrome is a relatively rare inherited defect of sexual differentiation characterised by failure of regression of the müllerian ducts in males. In affected individuals, uterus and tubes are present because of defects of synthesis or action of anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), normally produced by the Sertoli cells of the testis. Patients are normally virilised, although mono- or bilateral cryptorchidism may be present. We observed two brothers (chromosomes 46 XY), aged 11 years and 2 months and 8 years and 3 months respectively, with bilateral cryptorchidism. The diagnosis of persistent müllerian duct syndrome was made on the basis of laparoscopic evidence of uterus and tubes, undetectable plasma levels of AMH and a 23 base pair duplicative insertion in exon 5 of the AMH gene, causing the introduction of a premature stop codon, homozygous in the two brothers. The surgical correction of the genital abnormalities was successfully carried out by laparoscopic orchidopexy according to Fowler-Stephens. CONCLUSION:Persistent müllerian duct syndrome should be taken into consideration in all cases of bilateral cryptorchidism. Laparoscopy is the elective procedure for diagnosis of this disease and laparoscopic surgery for orchidopexy of intra-abdominal testes. Mutation analysis of the anti-müllerian hormone gene in these patients helps to understand the structure-function relationship of the anti-müllerian hormone protein, although it is not clear at present whether anti-müllerian hormone is necessary to maintain normal testicular function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

10770184,A simple test for growth hormone deficiency in adults.,"GH deficiency (GHD) in adults is a well recognized clinical syndrome that results in significant metabolic and psychological morbidity. GH replacement therapy not only reverses these changes but improves the quality of life and results in a significant improvement in well being. There is no single simple and safe test to assess GHD. GHD in adults is diagnosed biochemically by provocative testing of GH secretion, and the insulin tolerance test (ITT) is accepted to be the test of choice. However, the ITT has many contraindications, needs multiple blood samples, and is potentially dangerous, requiring regular monitoring of patients in a specialized investigation unit. The aim of our study was to evaluate the GH-releasing effect of a combination of the hypothalamic secretagogue GHRH with a small dose of the synthetic peptide GHRP-2, to diagnose GHD. We have compared the GH response to ITT and GHRH/GHRP in a large group of adults with hypothalamic/pituitary disease (n = 36; 22 males and 14 females; age, 18 -59 yr) and in healthy volunteers (n = 30; 15 males and 15 females; age, 22-66 yr). The GHRH/GHRP test produces a measurable GH secretory response in normal, hypopituitary and GH-deficient patients. The test has no side effects. Using the ITT as our 'gold standard' with a GH response of 9 mU/L as our cut-off to define GHD, we compared the clinical efficacy of these two tests. Choosing an arbitrary cut-off of 17 mU/L to define GHD in the GHRH/GHRP test, this new test proved to have 78.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity even when we only used the 30-min datum point.",comparative study; journal article
11567216,Syndromic short stature in patients with a germline mutation in the LIM homeobox LHX4.,"Studies of genetically engineered flies and mice have revealed the role that orthologs of the human LIM homeobox LHX4 have in the control of motor-neuron-identity assignment and in pituitary development. Remarkably, these mouse strains, which bear a targeted modification of Lhx4 in the heterozygous state, are asymptomatic, whereas homozygous animals die shortly after birth. Nevertheless, we have isolated the human LHX4 gene, as well as the corresponding cDNA sequence, to test whether it could be involved in developmental defects of the human pituitary region. LHX4, which encodes a protein 99% identical to its murine counterpart, consists of six coding exons and spans >45 kb of the q25 region of chromosome 1. We report a family with an LHX4 germline splice-site mutation that results in a disease phenotype characterized by short stature and by pituitary and hindbrain (i.e., cerebellar) defects in combination with abnormalities of the sella turcica of the central skull base. This intronic mutation, which segregates in a dominant and fully penetrant manner over three generations, abolishes normal LHX4 splicing and activates two exonic cryptic splice sites, thereby predicting two different proteins deleted in their homeodomain sequence. These findings, which elucidate the molecular basis of a complex Mendelian disorder, reveal the fundamental pleiotropic role played by a single factor that tightly coordinates brain development and skull shaping during head morphogenesis.",research-article; journal article
17065149,Identification of a mutation in SLC30A2 (ZnT-2) in women with low milk zinc concentration that results in transient neonatal zinc deficiency.,"Breast milk normally contains adequate zinc to meet infant requirements up to six months of age; however, transient neonatal zinc deficiency has been documented in exclusively breastfed infants of women with low milk zinc concentration. This condition is not corrected by maternal zinc supplementation, supporting the speculation that it results from an inherited genetic condition. We identified a family in which two exclusively breast-fed infants developed zinc deficiency that was associated with low milk zinc concentration in both women. Sequencing of genomic DNA detected a mis-sense mutation (Ade-->Gua) that substitutes a conserved histidine at amino acid 54 with arginine (H54R) in SLC30A2 (ZnT-2) that is present in both affected subjects and several other siblings. Gene knockdown of SLC30A2 in mammary epithelial cells reduced zinc secretion, illustrating the role of ZnT-2 in zinc secretion from this cell type. Expression of the H54R mutant in human embryonic kidney-293 cells resulted in reduced zinc secretion as a consequence of perinuclear, aggresomal accumulation, whereas co-expression of the H54R mutant and wild-type ZnT-2 did not abrogate increased zinc secretion in cells overexpressing wild-type ZnT-2 alone. Together, these data provide evidence that low milk zinc concentration in some women is a consequence of a genetic disorder resulting from a mutation in SLC30A2 and can result in neonatal zinc deficiency if unrecognized. Further studies are needed to evaluate the incidence and penetrance of this mutation in the human population.","journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25966638,A novel phenotype in N-glycosylation disorders: Gillessen-Kaesbach-Nishimura skeletal dysplasia due to pathogenic variants in ALG9.,"A rare lethal autosomal recessive syndrome with skeletal dysplasia, polycystic kidneys and multiple malformations was first described by Gillessen-Kaesbach et al and subsequently by Nishimura et al. The skeletal features uniformly comprise a round pelvis, mesomelic shortening of the upper limbs and defective ossification of the cervical spine. We studied two unrelated families including three affected fetuses with Gillessen-Kaesbach-Nishimura syndrome using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing, comparative genome hybridization and homozygosity mapping. All affected patients were shown to have a novel homozygous splice variant NM_024740.2: c.1173+2T>A in the ALG9 gene, encoding alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, involved in the formation of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor of N-glycosylation. RNA analysis demonstrated skipping of exon 10, leading to shorter RNA. Mass spectrometric analysis showed an increase in monoglycosylated transferrin as compared with control tissues, confirming that this is a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). Only three liveborn children with ALG9-CDG have been previously reported, all with missense variants. All three suffered from intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, microcephaly and renal cysts, but none had skeletal dysplasia. Our study shows that some pathogenic variants in ALG9 can present as a lethal skeletal dysplasia with visceral malformations as the most severe phenotype. The skeletal features overlap with that previously reported for ALG3- and ALG12-CDG, suggesting that this subset of glycosylation disorders constitutes a new diagnostic group of skeletal dysplasias.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
22009145,Novel NCC mutants and functional analysis in a new cohort of patients with Gitelman syndrome.,"Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis in conjunction with significant hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. The GS phenotype is caused by mutations in the solute carrier family 12, member 3 (SLC12A3) gene that encodes the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC). We analyzed DNA samples of 163 patients with a clinical suspicion of GS by direct sequencing of all 26 exons of the SLC12A3 gene. In total, 114 different mutations were identified, 31 of which have not been reported before. These novel variants include 3 deletions, 18 missense, 6 splice site and 4 nonsense mutations. We selected seven missense mutations to investigate their effect on NCC activity and plasma membrane localization by using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system. The Thr392Ile mutant did not display transport activity (probably class 2 mutation), while the Asn442Ser and Gln1030Arg NCC mutants showed decreased plasma membrane localization and consequently function, likely due to impaired trafficking (class 3 mutation). Even though the NaCl uptake was hampered for NCC mutants Glu121Asp, Pro751Leu, Ser475Cys and Tyr489His, the transporters reached the plasma membrane (class 4 mutation), suggesting an effect on NCC regulation or ion affinity. The present study shows the identification of 38 novel mutations in the SLC12A3 gene and provides insight into the mechanisms that regulate NCC.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
28003083,Gitelman syndrome: consensus and guidance from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Controversies Conference.,"Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a rare, salt-losing tubulopathy characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. The disease is recessively inherited, caused by inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene that encodes the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC). GS is usually detected during adolescence or adulthood, either fortuitously or in association with mild or nonspecific symptoms or both. The disease is characterized by high phenotypic variability and a significant reduction in the quality of life, and it may be associated with severe manifestations. GS is usually managed by a liberal salt intake together with oral magnesium and potassium supplements. A general problem in rare diseases is the lack of high quality evidence to inform diagnosis, prognosis, and management. We report here on the current state of knowledge related to the diagnostic evaluation, follow-up, management, and treatment of GS; identify knowledge gaps; and propose a research agenda to substantiate a number of issues related to GS. This expert consensus statement aims to establish an initial framework to enable clinical auditing and thus improve quality control of care.",journal article

7923357,The diastrophic dysplasia gene encodes a novel sulfate transporter: positional cloning by fine-structure linkage disequilibrium mapping.,"Diastrophic dysplasia (DTD) is a well-characterized autosomal recessive osteochondrodysplasia with clinical features including dwarfism, spinal deformation, and specific joint abnormalities. The disease occurs in most populations, but is particularly prevalent in Finland owing to an apparent founder effect. DTD maps to distal chromosome 5q and, based on linkage disequilibrium studies in the Finnish population, we had previously predicted that the DTD gene should lie about 64 kb away from the CSF1R locus. Here, we report the positional cloning of the DTD gene by fine-structure linkage disequilibrium mapping. The gene lies in the predicted location, approximately 70 kb proximal to CSF1R, and encodes a novel sulfate transporter. Impaired function of its product is likely to lead to undersulfation of proteoglycans in cartilage matrix and thereby to cause the clinical phenotype of the disease. These results demonstrate the power of linkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated populations for positional cloning.","comparative study; research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

In a nationwide study on male pseudohermaphroditism among all pediatric endocrinologists and clinical geneticists in The Netherlands, 18 17betaHSD3-deficient index cases were identified, 12 of whom initially had received the tentative diagnosis androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). The phenotypes and genotypes of these patients were studied. Endocrine diagnostic methods were evaluated in comparison to mutation analysis of the HSD17B3 gene. RT-PCR studies were performed on testicular ribonucleic acid of patients homozygous for two different splice site mutations. The minimal incidence of 17betaHSD3 deficiency in The Netherlands and the corresponding carrier frequency were calculated. Haplotype analysis of the chromosomal region of the HSD17B3 gene in Europeans, North Americans, Latin Americans, Australians, and Arabs was used to establish whether recurrent identical mutations were ancient or had repeatedly occurred de novo. In genotypically identical cases, phenotypic variation for external sexual development was observed. Gonadotropin-stimulated serum testosterone/androstenedione ratios in 17betaHSD3-deficient patients were discriminative in all cases and did not overlap with ratios in normal controls or with ratios in AIS patients. In all investigated patients both HSD17B3 alleles were mutated. The intronic mutations 325 + 4;A-->T and 655-1;G-->A disrupted normal splicing, but a small amount of wild-type messenger ribonucleic acid was still made in patients homozygous for 655-1;G-->A. The minimal incidence of 17betaHSD3 deficiency in The Netherlands was shown to be 1: 147,000, with a heterozygote frequency of 1:135. At least 4 mutations, 325 + 4;A-->T, N74T, 655-1;G-->A, and R80Q, found worldwide, appeared to be ancient and originating from genetic founders. Their dispersion could be reconstructed through historical analysis. The HSD17B3 gene mutations 326-1;G-->C and P282L were de novo mutations. 17betaHSD3 deficiency can be reliably diagnosed by endocrine evaluation and mutation analysis. Phenotypic variation can occur between families with the same homozygous mutations. The incidence of 17betaHSD3 deficiency is 0.65 times the incidence of AIS, which is thought to be the most frequent known cause of male pseudohermaphroditism without dysgenic gonads. A global inventory of affected cases demonstrated the ancient origin of at least four mutations. The mutational history of this genetic locus offers views into human diversity and disease, provided by national and international collaboration.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16410789,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a recessive disease characterized by compound heterozygosity.,"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene. Historically, PXE has been suggested to be inherited either in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. To determine the exact mode of inheritance of PXE and to address the question of phenotypic expression in mutation carriers, we identified seven pedigrees with affected individuals in two different generations and sequenced the entire coding region of ABCC6 in affected individuals, presumed carriers with a limited phenotype and unaffected family members. Two allelic mutations were identified in each individual with unambiguous diagnosis of PXE, as well as in those with only minimal clinical signs suggestive of PXE but with positive skin biopsy. Missense mutations were frequently detected in the latter cases. In conclusion, PXE is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and presence of disease in two generations is due to pseudodominance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
20301292,Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a systemic disorder that affects the elastic tissue of the skin, the eye, and the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. Individuals most commonly present with papules in the skin and/or with angioid streaks of the retina found on routine eye examination or associated with retinal hemorrhage. Rarely, individuals may present with vascular signs and symptoms, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, angina, or intermittent claudication. The most frequent cause of morbidity and disability in PXE is reduced vision from macular hemorrhage and disciform scarring of the macula. Most affected individuals live a normal life span. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of PXE is suspected in individuals with characteristic skin and ocular findings and is established by histologic findings on biopsy of lesional skin. ABCC6 (formerly known as MRP6), which encodes the ATP-binding cassette protein multidrug resistance-associated protein 6, is the only gene known to be associated with PXE. Molecular genetic testing detects a pathogenic variant in one allele in almost all affected individuals and in both alleles in close to 90%. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Coordinated care by a multidisciplinary team (dermatologist, primary care physician, ophthalmologist, cardiologist, vascular surgeon, plastic surgeon, genetics professional, nutritionist) depending on clinical manifestations; contact with support groups for accurate information and to reduce the sense of isolation; intraocular injection of anti-angiogenic drugs for the treatment of macular degeneration; surgical or radiologic intervention as indicated for gastrointestinal bleeding or severe peripheral vascular disease. Surveillance: Routine examination by an ophthalmologist with expertise in retinal disease; routine physical examination with special attention to the cardiovascular system; monitoring for the development of black tarry stool; periodic monitoring of serum lipid concentrations. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports or racquet sports without appropriate eye and head protection; aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications because of gastrointestinal bleeding risk. Pregnancy management: Retinal examination during pregnancy and prompt attention to any visual symptoms are advised. GENETIC COUNSELING:PXE is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once an at-risk sib is known to be unaffected, the chance of his/her being a carrier is 2/3. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible once the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family.",book; review
24749718,Visual Impairment in Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum: A Survey of 40 Patients.,"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is an inherited disorder of connective tissue characterized, among other symptoms, by impaired vision.To evaluate the nature and age of onset of ophthalmologic manifestations in pseudoxanthoma elasticum.Forty consecutive patients affected with pseudoxanthoma elasticum underwent measurements of their refractive error and visual acuity, together with slit-lamp examination.The mean age of the patients (8 M, 32 F) was 43.35 years. Fifty-seven eyes (33 patients, mean age: 40.75 years) had a BCVA >20/50 whereas 23 eyes in 16 patients (mean age: 53.31 years) had ≤20/50. Seven patients (17.50%), all but one over 52 years old, were visually disabled. BCVA ≤20/50 in at least one eye was observed in 73.33% of patients of 52 years old or older and in 20.00% of patients younger than 52, respectively. Angioid streaks were observed in 75 eyes (93.75%) and extended toward the macula in 51 eyes from 29 patients. Macular involvement was observed for the first time at a mean age of 44.28 years. Neovascularization was observed in 28 eyes (17 patients; mean age: 51.70 years), all with poor BCVA.Macular choroidal neovascularization is frequent in pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and accounts for the poor ophthalmologic natural history of the disease. Patients should be advised to self-monitor their visual acuity using the Amsler grid. The frequency of choroidal neovascularization appears age-dependent, suggesting that bi-yearly fundus examination is appropriate in young patients whereas patients older than 40 should be examined twice a year.",journal article
23935882,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum: cardiac findings in patients and Abcc6-deficient mouse model.,"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene, is a rare multiorgan disease characterized by the mineralization and fragmentation of elastic fibers in connective tissue. Cardiac complications reportedly associated with PXE are mainly based on case reports.A cohort of 67 PXE patients was prospectively assessed. Patients underwent physical examination, electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), treadmill testing, and perfusion myocardial scintigraphy (SPECT). Additionally, the hearts of a PXE mouse models (Abcc6(-/-)) and wild-type controls (WT) were analyzed.Three patients had a history of proven coronary artery disease. In total, 40 patients underwent exercise treadmill tests, and 28 SPECT. The treadmill tests were all negative. SPECT showed mild perfusion abnormalities in two patients. Mean left ventricular (LV) dimension and function values were within the normal range. LV hypertrophy was found in 7 (10.4%) patients, though the hypertrophy etiology was unknown for 3 of those patients. Echocardiography revealed frequent but insignificant mitral and tricuspid valvulopathies. Mitral valve prolapse was present in 3 patients (4.5%). Two patients exhibited significant aortic stenosis (3.0%). While none of the functional and histological parameters diverged significantly between the Abcc6(-/-) and WT mice groups at age of 6 and 12 months, the 24-month-old Abcc6(-/-) mice developed cardiac hypertrophy without contractile dysfunction.Despite sporadic cases, PXE does not appear to be associated with frequent cardiac complications. However, the development of cardiac hypertrophy in the 24-month-old Abcc6(-/-) mice suggests that old PXE patients might be prone to developing late cardiopathy.","clinical trial; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25383264,"PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM: DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES, CLASSIFICATION, AND TREATMENT OPTIONS.","INTRODUCTION:Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a multisystem orphan disease, clinically affects the skin, the eyes, and the cardiovascular system with considerable morbidity and mortality. The clinical manifestations reflect the underlying pathology consisting of ectopic mineralization of peripheral connective tissues. AREAS COVERED:The diagnostic criteria of PXE include characteristic clinical findings, together with histopathology of accumulation of pleiomorphic elastic structures in the dermis with progressive mineralization, and the presence of mutations in the ABCC6 gene. PXE-like cutaneous changes can also be encountered in other ectopic mineralization disorders, including generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) caused by mutations in the ENPP1 gene. In some cases, overlapping clinical features of PXE/GACI, associated with mutations either in ABCC6 or ENPP1, have been noted. PXE demonstrates considerable inter- and intrafamilial heterogeneity, and consequently, accurate diagnosis is required for appropriate classification with prognostic implications. There is no effective and specific treatment for the systemic manifestations of PXE, but effective therapies to counteract the ocular complications are in current clinical use. EXPERT OPINION:A number of observations in the murine model, the Abcc6-/- mouse, have indicated that the mineral composition of diet, particularly the magnesium content, can influence the severity of the mineralization phenotype. These observations suggest that appropriate dietary interventions, coupled with lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, might alleviate the symptoms and improve the quality of life of individuals affected with this, currently intractable, orphan disease.",research-article; journal article

She initially revealed systemic hypertension and moderate mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse. One year after the start of treatment for hypertension, thickening of the mitral valve gradually progressed and she showed tight mitral stenosis without regurgitation. It was considered that another differential diagnosis must be added to the uncommon causes of mitral stenosis.",journal article

23968982,Characterization of cardiovascular involvement in pseudoxanthoma elasticum families.,"OBJECTIVE: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder with involvement of the skin, the retina, and the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular involvement is mainly characterized by mineralization and fragmentation of elastic fibers of blood vessels and premature atherosclerosis. We conducted an ultrasound study to investigate the cardiovascular phenotype and to propose recommendations for the management of patients with PXE and heterozygous ABCC6 mutation carriers. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Thirty-two patients, 23 carriers, and 28 healthy volunteers underwent cardiac and vascular ultrasound studies. Cardiac imaging revealed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients with PXE with a significantly prolonged deceleration time and lower septal early diastolic velocities of the mitral annulus compared with controls. Carriers also demonstrated significantly prolonged deceleration time. Carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity was significantly increased in patients with PXE when compared with carriers and controls. Vascular imaging revealed a high prevalence of peripheral artery disease in both patients and carriers and a significantly higher carotid intima-media thickness compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study clearly demonstrate impaired left ventricular diastolic function, impairment of the elastic properties of the aorta, and a high prevalence of peripheral artery disease in patients with PXE. Carriers also seem to exhibit a cardiovascular phenotype with mainly mild diastolic dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis. Increased awareness for cardiovascular events in both patients and heterozygous carriers is warranted.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29652691,VISUAL ACUITY IN PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM.,"PURPOSE:To assess the age-specific proportion of visual impairment in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and to compare this with foveal abnormality and similar data of late age-related macular degeneration patients. METHODS:Cross-sectional data of 195 patients with PXE were reviewed, including best-corrected visual acuity and imaging. The World Health Organisation criteria were used to categorize bilateral visual impairment. These results were compared with similar data of 131 patients with late age-related macular degeneration from the Rotterdam study. RESULTS:Overall, 50 PXE patients (26.0%) were visually impaired, including 21 (11%) with legal blindness. Visual functioning declined with increasing age. In patients older than 50 years, 37% was visually impaired and 15% legally blind. Foveal choroidal neovascularization was found in 84% of eyes with a best-corrected visual acuity lower than 20/70 (0.30) and macular atrophy in the fovea in 16%. In late age-related macular degeneration patients, 40% were visually impaired and 13% legally blind. Visual impairment started approximately 20 years later as compared with PXE patients. CONCLUSION:Visual impairment and blindness are frequent in PXE, particularly in patients older than 50 years. Although choroidal neovascularization is associated with the majority of vision loss, macular atrophy is also common. The proportion of visual impairment in PXE is comparable with late age-related macular degeneration but manifests earlier in life.",journal article
23577018,An update on the ocular phenotype in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum.,"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an inherited multi-system disorder characterized by ectopic mineralization and fragmentation of elastic fibers in the skin, the elastic laminae of blood vessels and Bruch's membrane in the eye. Biallelic mutations in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene ABCC6 on chromosome 16 are responsible for the disease. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood. However, there is consent that a metabolic alteration leads to dysfunction in extracellular calcium homeostasis and subsequent calcification of connective tissues rich in elastic fibers. This review summarizes and aims at explaining the variety of phenotypic ocular findings in patients with PXE. Specialized imaging techniques including white light fundus photography, blue light autofluorescence, near-infrared confocal reflectance imaging, high resolution optical coherence tomography, fluorescein and indocyanine green (ICG) angiography have revealed characteristic lesions at the ocular fundus of PXE patients. These include the classic signs of angioid streaks, peau d'orange, comet lesions, and choroidal neovascularizations (CNVs), but also the more recently recognized features such as chorioretinal atrophy, subretinal fluid independent from CNV, pattern dystrophy-like changes, debris accumulation under the retinal pigment epithelium, reticular drusen and a decreased fluorescence on late phase ICG angiography.",research-article; journal article

Recent genetic advances have identified the underlying defect to the ABCC6 gene on chromosome 16p13.1. Patients typically develop cutaneous, ocular, and cardiovascular manifestations but there is considerable phenotypic variability. The skin changes are usually apparent in adulthood, and rarely observed in childhood. Since the prognosis of PXE largely depends on the extent of extracutaneous organ involvement early recognition, intervention and lifestyle adjustments are important to reduce morbidity.

23762643,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum of the skin with involvement of the oral cavity.,"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an inherited multisystemic disease of elastic fibers that primarily affects the skin and retina. A case of primary PXE of the skin with late involvement of the upper lip is reported. A 55-year-old woman with a previous diagnosis of PXE affecting her skin developed a lesion on her lower lip. An oral examination identified a yellowish macule of undefined limits. A biopsy from her lip was taken and both light and transmission electron microscopies confirmed the presence of fragmented elastic fibers and calcifications on her mucosa, which was compatible with the diagnosis of oral PXE. Since the manifestation of oral PXE is rare in this region, dental practitioners must be aware that this systemic condition may produce oral lesions, which sometimes may mimic other benign diseases of the oral cavity like Fordyce granules. So, the establishment of an appropriate diagnosis is necessary to provide adequate information and attention to the patient.",research-article; journal article
25526100,Peau d'orange and angioid streaks: manifestations of Bruch membrane pathology.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to characterize peau d'orange and angioid streaks, characteristic findings in eyes of patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum, by examining fundus photography and optical coherence tomography imaging. METHODS: Color photographs were evaluated directly as were the component red and green channels. Optical coherence tomography images were evaluated for reflectivity pattern of the band corresponding to the retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch membrane complex. RESULTS: Eighteen eyes of 9 patients with a mean age of 48.7 years (range, 31-61 years) were examined; 7 of them were women. Color photographs showed areas of yellowish opacification that obscured visualization of the underlying choroid. At the outer edges of this confluent area, opacification were nonconfluent changes with similar appearance and these regions were typical peau d'orange. Angioid streaks occurred within and extended up to the outer border of the confluent opacification. Underlying choroidal details could be seen through the regions of peau d'orange and through the gaps in angioid streaks. The red channel image showed increased reflectivity from the confluent deposit and improved visualization of the choroidal vasculature, except where the confluent opacification was located. Optical coherence tomography imaging showed increased reflectivity from the outer border of the retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch membrane complex. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the confluent region is the relevant lesion, not the subconfluent zone known as peau d'orange. Imaging characteristics of the confluent area of opacity are consistent with diffuse infiltration with calcium, a chief histologic abnormality of pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The name coquille d'oeuf was suggested for the confluent area of opacity as a consequence.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
27622520,Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum - Also a Lung Disease? The Respiratory Affection of Patients with Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum.,"BACKGROUND:Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal-recessive mineralisation disorder caused by loss of function mutations in the ABCC6 Gen. Histological findings and data of an autopsy of a PXE-patient suggest a possible pulmonal calcification. So far, there exists no clinical data whether PXE patients actually are at high risk of developing pulmonary disorder. METHODS:In a cross-sectional study, 35 PXE patients and 15 healthy controls underwent a pulmonary function testing, including spirometry, body plethysmography and carbon monoxide diffusing test. Additionally, PXE patients completed a COPD-Assessment-Test (CAT). RESULTS:We observed in PXE patients normal values for predicted vital capacity (VC%; 96.0±13.0%), predicted total lung capacity (TLC%; 98.2±12.0%) and predicted forced expiration volume (FEV1%; 102.5±15.6%), whereas compared to healthy controls the PXE group showed significant diminished values for carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO, 7.2 ±1.4mmol/min/kPa vs. 8.6 ±1.5 mmol/min/kPa; p = 0.008) and predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO%; 79.7±11.5% vs. 87.2±6.6%; p = 0.008). 11/35 (31.4%) PXE patients showed pathological DLCO% values under 75% (68.5%±5.4%). CONCLUSION:PXE patients demonstrated a regular lung function testing, but nevertheless they had impaired CO diffusing parameters, which might be associated with a preclinical state of an interstitial lung disease and a risk for restrictive ventilation disorders.",research-article; journal article
16429403,BMPR2 gene rearrangements account for a significant proportion of mutations in familial and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.,"Mutations of the BMPR2 gene predispose to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a serious, progressive disease of the pulmonary vascular system. However, despite the fact that most PAH families are consistent with linkage to the BMPR2 locus, sequencing only identifies mutations in some 55% of familial cases and between 10% and 40% of cases without a family history (idiopathic or IPAH). We therefore conducted a systematic analysis for larger gene rearrangements in panels of both familial and idiopathic PAH cases that were negative on sequencing of coding regions. Analysis of exon dosage across the entire gene using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification identified nine novel rearrangements and enabled full characterization at the exon level of previously reported deletions. Overall, BMPR2 rearrangements were identified in 7 of 58 families and 6 of 126 IPAH cases, suggesting that gross rearrangements underlie around 12% of all FPAH cases and 5% of IPAH. Importantly, two deletions encompassed all functional protein domains and are predicted to result in null mutations, providing the strongest support yet that the predominant molecular mechanism for disease predisposition is haploinsufficiency. Dosage analysis should now be considered an integral of part of the molecular work-up of PAH patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16429395,Mutations of the TGF-beta type II receptor BMPR2 in pulmonary arterial hypertension.,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is clinically characterized by a sustained elevation in mean pulmonary artery pressure leading to significant morbidity and mortality. The disorder is typically sporadic, and in such cases the term idiopathic PAH (IPAH) is used. However, cases that occur within families (familial PAH (FPAH)) display similar clinical and histopathological features, suggesting a common etiology. Heterozygous mutations of a type II member of the TGF-beta cell signaling superfamily known as BMPR2 on chromosome 2q33 have been identified in many kindreds with FPAH, yet display both reduced penetrance and sex bias. This report presents the compilation of data for 144 distinct mutations that alter the coding sequence of the BMPR2 gene identified in 210 independent PAH subjects. This large data set characterizes the extent of sequence variation and reveals that the majority (71%) of mutations in FPAH and IPAH comprise nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site defects, and gene rearrangements. These predict premature termination of the transcript with likely loss through the process of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). A total of 44 missense mutations were identified that substitute amino acid residues at highly conserved sites within recognized functional domains of the mature receptor. We assess this category of mutations in the context of their heterogeneous effects on cell signaling when assayed by in vitro cell-based systems. Disease-causing mutation hot-spots within BMPR2 are summarized. Taken together, these observations are likely to aid in the development of targeted mutation detection strategies relevant for patient management. Finally, we examine the age- and sex-dependent reduced penetrance of BMPR2 mutations by reviewing bmpr2 animal models and the requirement for additional genetic and/or environmental modifiers of disease. In conclusion, these data provide compelling genetic evidence that haploinsufficiency is the predominant molecular mechanism underlying disease predisposition, and support the concept of a critical threshold of signaling activity below which disease may be precipitated.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
12446270,Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease caused by an inherited mutation in bone morphogenetic protein receptor II.,Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare form of pulmonary hypertension in which the vascular changes originate in the small pulmonary veins and venules. The pathogenesis is unknown and any link with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) has been speculative. Mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor II (BMPR2) gene have been identified in at least 50% of familial cases and in 25% of sporadic cases of PPH. We report a patient with documented PVOD whose mother had severe pulmonary hypertension. Sequencing of the patient's BMPR2 coding region revealed a del44C mutation in Exon 1 that is predicted to encode for a truncated protein. Analysis of DNA from family members suggests that this mutation was transmitted by the proband's mother to two of her four children. The finding of PVOD associated with a BMPR2 mutation reveals a possible pathogenetic connection with PPH.,"research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article; case reports"
24403049,Congenital disorder of fucosylation type 2c (LADII) presenting with short stature and developmental delay with minimal adhesion defect.,"Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II is a hereditary disorder of neutrophil migration caused by mutations in the guanosine diphosphate-fucose transporter gene (SLC35C1). In these patients, inability to generate key fucosylated molecules including sialyl Lewis X leads to leukocytosis and recurrent infections, in addition to short stature and developmental delay. We report two brothers with short stature and developmental delay who are compound heterozygotes for novel mutations in SLC35C1 resulting in partial in vivo defects in fucosylation. Specifically, plasma glycoproteins including immunoglobulin G demonstrated marked changes in glycoform distribution. While neutrophil rolling on endothelial selectins was partially impeded, residual adhesion proved sufficient to avoid leukocytosis or recurrent infection. These findings demonstrate a surprising degree of immune redundancy in the face of substantial alterations in adhesion molecule expression, and show that short stature and developmental delay may be the sole presenting signs in this disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18371931,"Loss of nephrocystin-3 function can cause embryonic lethality, Meckel-Gruber-like syndrome, situs inversus, and renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia.","Many genetic diseases have been linked to the dysfunction of primary cilia, which occur nearly ubiquitously in the body and act as solitary cellular mechanosensory organelles. The list of clinical manifestations and affected tissues in cilia-related disorders (ciliopathies) such as nephronophthisis is broad and has been attributed to the wide expression pattern of ciliary proteins. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to this dramatic diversity of phenotypes. We recently reported hypomorphic NPHP3 mutations in children and young adults with isolated nephronophthisis and associated hepatic fibrosis or tapetoretinal degeneration. Here, we chose a combinatorial approach in mice and humans to define the phenotypic spectrum of NPHP3/Nphp3 mutations and the role of the nephrocystin-3 protein. We demonstrate that the pcy mutation generates a hypomorphic Nphp3 allele that is responsible for the cystic kidney disease phenotype, whereas complete loss of Nphp3 function results in situs inversus, congenital heart defects, and embryonic lethality in mice. In humans, we show that NPHP3 mutations can cause a broad clinical spectrum of early embryonic patterning defects comprising situs inversus, polydactyly, central nervous system malformations, structural heart defects, preauricular fistulas, and a wide range of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). On the functional level, we show that nephrocystin-3 directly interacts with inversin and can inhibit like inversin canonical Wnt signaling, whereas nephrocystin-3 deficiency leads in Xenopus laevis to typical planar cell polarity defects, suggesting a role in the control of canonical and noncanonical (planar cell polarity) Wnt signaling.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
15666242,Antenatal presentation of Bardet-Biedl syndrome may mimic Meckel syndrome.,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a multisystemic disorder characterized by postaxial polydactyly, progressive retinal dystrophy, obesity, hypogonadism, renal dysfunction, and learning difficulty. Other manifestations include diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hepatic fibrosis, and neurological features. The condition is genetically heterogeneous, and eight genes (BBS1-BBS8) have been identified to date. A mutation of the BBS1 gene on chromosome 11q13 is observed in 30%-40% of BBS cases. In addition, a complex triallelic inheritance has been established in this disorder--that is, in some families, three mutations at two BBS loci are necessary for the disease to be expressed. The clinical features of BBS that can be observed at birth are polydactyly, kidney anomaly, hepatic fibrosis, and genital and heart malformations. Interestingly, polydactyly, cystic kidneys, and liver anomalies (hepatic fibrosis with bile-duct proliferation) are also observed in Meckel syndrome, along with occipital encephalocele. Therefore, we decided to sequence the eight BBS genes in a series of 13 antenatal cases presenting with cystic kidneys and polydactyly and/or hepatic fibrosis but no encephalocele. These fetuses were mostly diagnosed as having Meckel or ""Meckel-like"" syndrome. In six cases, we identified a recessive mutation in a BBS gene (three in BBS2, two in BBS4, and one in BBS6). We found a heterozygous BBS6 mutation in three additional cases. No BBS1, BBS3, BBS5, BBS7, or BBS8 mutations were identified in our series. These results suggest that the antenatal presentation of BBS may mimic Meckel syndrome.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
19043417,Reticular dysgenesis (aleukocytosis) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding mitochondrial adenylate kinase 2.,"Human severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) are phenotypically and genotypically heterogeneous diseases. Reticular dysgenesis is the most severe form of inborn SCID. It is characterized by absence of granulocytes and almost complete deficiency of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, hypoplasia of the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs, and lack of innate and adaptive humoral and cellular immune functions, leading to fatal septicemia within days after birth. In bone marrow of individuals with reticular dysgenesis, myeloid differentiation is blocked at the promyelocytic stage, whereas erythro- and megakaryocytic maturation is generally normal. These features exclude a defect in hematopoietic stem cells but point to a unique aberration of the myelo-lymphoid lineages. The dramatic clinical course of reticular dysgenesis and its unique hematological phenotype have spurred interest in the unknown genetic basis of this syndrome. Here we show that the gene encoding the mitochondrial energy metabolism enzyme adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) is mutated in individuals with reticular dysgenesis. Knockdown of zebrafish ak2 also leads to aberrant leukocyte development, stressing the evolutionarily conserved role of AK2. Our results provide in vivo evidence for AK2 selectivity in leukocyte differentiation. These observations suggest that reticular dysgenesis is the first example of a human immunodeficiency syndrome that is causally linked to energy metabolism and that can therefore be classified as a mitochondriopathy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

10319867,Mutations in RECQL4 cause a subset of cases of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome.,"Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS; also known as poikiloderma congenitale) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in skin and skeleton, juvenile cataracts, premature ageing and a predisposition to neoplasia. Cytogenetic studies indicate that cells from affected patients show genomic instability often associated with chromosomal rearrangements causing an acquired somatic mosaicism. The gene(s) responsible for RTS remains unknown. The genes responsible for Werner and Bloom syndromes (WRN and BLM, respectively) have been identified as homologues of Escherichia coli RecQ, which encodes a DNA helicase that unwinds double-stranded DNA into single-stranded DNAs. Other eukaryotic homologues thus far identified are human RECQL, Saccharomyces cerevisiae SGS1 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe rqh1. We recently cloned two new human helicase genes, RECQL4 at 8q24.3 and RECQL5 at 17q25, which encode members of the RecQ helicase family. Here, we report that three RTS patients carried two types of compound heterozygous mutations in RECQL4. The fact that the mutated alleles were inherited from the parents in one affected family and were not found in ethnically matched controls suggests that mutation of RECQL4 at human chromosome 8q24.3 is responsible for at least some cases of RTS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20113479,Rothmund-Thomson syndrome.,"Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) is a genodermatosis presenting with a characteristic facial rash (poikiloderma) associated with short stature, sparse scalp hair, sparse or absent eyelashes and/or eyebrows, juvenile cataracts, skeletal abnormalities, radial ray defects, premature aging and a predisposition to cancer. The prevalence is unknown but around 300 cases have been reported in the literature so far. The diagnostic hallmark is facial erythema, which spreads to the extremities but spares the trunk, and which manifests itself within the first year and then develops into poikiloderma. Two clinical subforms of RTS have been defined: RTSI characterised by poikiloderma, ectodermal dysplasia and juvenile cataracts, and RTSII characterised by poikiloderma, congenital bone defects and an increased risk of osteosarcoma in childhood and skin cancer later in life. The skeletal abnormalities may be overt (frontal bossing, saddle nose and congenital radial ray defects), and/or subtle (visible only by radiographic analysis). Gastrointestinal, respiratory and haematological signs have been reported in a few patients. RTS is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is genetically heterogeneous: RTSII is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the RECQL4 helicase gene (detected in 60-65% of RTS patients), whereas the aetiology in RTSI remains unknown. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings (primarily on the age of onset, spreading and appearance of the poikiloderma) and molecular analysis for RECQL4 mutations. Missense mutations are rare, while frameshift, nonsense mutations and splice-site mutations prevail. A fully informative test requires transcript analysis not to overlook intronic deletions causing missplicing. The diagnosis of RTS should be considered in all patients with osteosarcoma, particularly if associated with skin changes. The differential diagnosis should include other causes of childhood poikiloderma (including dyskeratosis congenita, Kindler syndrome and Poikiloderma with Neutropaenia), other rare genodermatoses with prominent telangiectasias (including Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome and Ataxia-telangiectasia) and the allelic disorders, RAPADILINO syndrome and Baller-Gerold syndrome, which also share some clinical features. A few mutations recur in all three RECQL4 diseases. Genetic counselling should be provided for RTS patients and their families, together with a recommendation for cancer surveillance for all patients with RTSII. Patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team and offered long term follow-up. Treatment includes the use of pulsed dye laser photocoagulation to improve the telangiectatic component of the rash, surgical removal of the cataracts and standard treatment for individuals who develop cancer. Although some clinical signs suggest precocious aging, life expectancy is not impaired in RTS patients if they do not develop cancer. Outcomes in patients with osteosarcoma are similar in RTS and non-RTS patients, with a five-year survival rate of 60-70%. The sensitivity of RTS cells to genotoxic agents exploiting cells with a known RECQL4 status is being elucidated and is aimed at optimizing the chemotherapeutic regimen for osteosarcoma.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article"
11471165,Clinical manifestations in a cohort of 41 Rothmund-Thomson syndrome patients.,"Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis characterized by a poikilodermatous rash starting in infancy, small stature, skeletal abnormalities, juvenile cataracts, and predisposition to specific cancers. We have identified a contemporary cohort of 41 patients to better define the clinical profile, diagnostic criteria, and management of patients with RTS. Patients with the diagnosis of RTS were ascertained by referrals from dermatology, ophthalmology, genetics, and oncology or from direct contact with the patient's family. Medical information was obtained from interviews with physicians, patients, and their parents and a review of medical records. The age range at ascertainment was 9 months to 42 years (28 males and 13 females; M:F, 2:1). All subjects displayed a characteristic rash. Thirteen subjects had osteosarcoma (OS) (32%), eight had radial defects (20%), seven had gastrointestinal findings (17%), two had cataracts (6%), and one had skin cancer (2%). Twenty-two of 28 patients without OS were less than 15 years old and thus remain at significant risk for this tumor. This case-series study reveals a clinical profile of RTS that includes a higher prevalence of OS and fewer cataracts, compared with historical reports. These differences may reflect either allelic or genetic heterogeneity. This study documents the frequency of clinical anomalies in a contemporary cohort of RTS patients and revises guidelines for diagnosis and management of RTS.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23785136,Gangliosides and gangliosidoses: principles of molecular and metabolic pathogenesis.,"Gangliosides are the main glycolipids of neuronal plasma membranes. Their surface patterns are generated by coordinated processes, involving biosynthetic pathways of the secretory compartments, catabolic steps of the endolysosomal system, and intracellular trafficking. Inherited defects in ganglioside biosynthesis causing fatal neurodegenerative diseases have been described so far almost exclusively in mouse models, whereas inherited defects in ganglioside catabolism causing various clinical forms of GM1- and GM2-gangliosidoses have long been known. For digestion, gangliosides are endocytosed and reach intra-endosomal vesicles. At the level of late endosomes, they are depleted of membrane-stabilizing lipids like cholesterol and enriched with bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP). Lysosomal catabolism is catalyzed at acidic pH values by cationic sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs), presenting lipids to their respective hydrolases, electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged surface of the luminal BMP-rich vesicles. Various inherited defects of ganglioside hydrolases, e.g., of β-galactosidase and β-hexosaminidases, and of GM2-activator protein, cause infantile (with tetraparesis, dementia, blindness) and different protracted clinical forms of GM1- and GM2-gangliosidoses. Mutations yielding proteins with small residual catabolic activities in the lysosome give rise to juvenile and adult clinical forms with a wide range of clinical symptomatology. Apart from patients' differences in their genetic background, clinical heterogeneity may be caused by rather diverse substrate specificities and functions of lysosomal hydrolases, multifunctional properties of SAPs, and the strong regulation of ganglioside catabolism by membrane lipids. Currently, there is no treatment available for neuronal ganglioside storage diseases. Therapeutic approaches in mouse models and patients with juvenile forms of gangliosidoses are discussed.",research-article; journal article
18398855,Schinzel-Giedion syndrome: report of splenopancreatic fusion and proposed diagnostic criteria.,"We report on the 46th patient with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS) and the first observation of splenopancreatic fusion in this syndrome. In the antenatal period, a male fetus was found to have bilateral hydronephrosis. Postnatally, in keeping with a diagnosis of SGS, there were large fontanelles, ocular hypertelorism, a wide, broad forehead, midface retraction, a short, upturned nose, macroglossia, and a short neck. Other anomalies included cardiac defects, widened and dense long bone cortices, cerebral ventriculomegaly, and abnormal fundi. Splenopancreatic fusion, usually encountered in trisomy 13, was found on autopsy. Schinzel-Giedion syndrome is likely a monogenic condition for which neither the heritability pattern nor pathogenesis has yet been determined. A clinical diagnosis may be made by identifying the facial phenotype, including prominent forehead, midface retraction, and short, upturned nose, plus one of either of the two other major distinguishing features: typical skeletal abnormalities or hydronephrosis. Typical skeletal anomalies include a sclerotic skull base, wide supraoccipital-exoccipital synchondrosis, increased cortical density or thickness, and broad ribs. Other highly supportive features include neuroepithelial tumors (found in 17%), hypertrichosis, and brain abnormalities. Severe developmental delay and poor survival are constant features in reported patients.",journal article; case reports
9024558,Cardiovascular malformations in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.,"We reviewed 215 patients (59 new, 156 from the literature) with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), and found that 95 (44%) had a cardiovascular malformation (CVM). Classifying CVMs by disordered embryonic mechanisms, there were 5 (5.3%) class 1 (ectomesenchymal tissue migration abnormalities), 56 (58.9%) class II (abnormal intracardiac blood flow), 25 (26.3%) class IV (abnormal extracellular matrix), and 5 (5.3%) class V (abnormal targeted growth). Comparing the frequencies of individual CVMs in this series with a control group (the Baltimore-Washington Infant Study), there were 6 individual CVMs which showed a significant difference from expected values. When frequencies of CVMs in SLOS were analyzed by mechanistic class, classes IV and V were significantly more frequent, and class I significantly less frequent, than the control group. Although CVMs in SLOS display mechanistic heterogeneity, with an overall predominance of class II CVMs, the developmental error appears to favor alteration of the cardiovascular developmental mechanisms underlying atrioventricular canal and anomalous pulmonary venous return. This information should assist the clinical geneticist evaluating a patient with possible SLOS, and should suggest research direction for the mechanisms responsible for the SLOS phenotype.",review; journal article
10807690,The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.,"The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is one of the archetypical multiple congenital malformation syndromes. The recent discovery of the biochemical cause of SLOS and the subsequent redefinition of SLOS as an inborn error of cholesterol metabolism have led to important new treatment possibilities for affected patients. Moreover, the recent recognition of the important role of cholesterol in vertebrate embryogenesis, especially with regard to the hedgehog embryonic signalling pathway and its effects on the expression of homeobox genes, has provided an explanation for the abnormal morphogenesis in the syndrome. The well known role of cholesterol in the formation of steroid hormones has also provided a possible explanation for the abnormal behavioural characteristics of SLOS.",review-article; review; journal article

12873855,Phenotypic features and genetic findings in sacsin-related autosomal recessive ataxia in Tunisia.,"BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a clinically homogenous disorder reported in Quebec caused by mutations in the SACS gene (chromosome 13q12). Recently, we identified a Tunisian kindred demonstrating linkage to the ARSACS locus. OBJECTIVE: To report clinical, neurophysiological, and nerve biopsy findings in patients with autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia related to the SACS gene in Tunisia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genetic linkage analysis of patients with early-onset autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia allowed the identification of 4 families from which 18 patients demonstrated linkage to the ARSACS locus. The patients were evaluated according to the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale. Peripheral nerve conduction, sensory evoked potentials, and nerve biopsy were performed in most patients. RESULTS: The mean age at onset was 4.5 years. The clinical phenotype was stereotyped and associated with a progressive cerebellar syndrome, a pyramidal syndrome with brisk knee reflexes, and Babinski sign and absent ankle reflexes. The course of the disease varied among patients. Sensory evoked potentials showed severe posterior column involvement. Peripheral nerve investigations demonstrated axonal and demyelinating neuropathy. Four mutations, 2 missense and 2 nonsense, were found. CONCLUSION: In Tunisia, autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia related to the SACS gene demonstrated a homogenous phenotype and heterogeneous allelic mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18465152,ARSACS in the Dutch population: a frequent cause of early-onset cerebellar ataxia.,"Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS: MIM 270550) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset cerebellar ataxia with spasticity and peripheral neuropathy. This disorder, considered to be rare, was first described in the late seventies among French Canadians in the isolated Charlevoix-Saguenay region of Quebec. Nowadays, it is known that the disorder is not only limited to this region but occurs worldwide. Our objective was to identify cases of autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) in Dutch patients with recessive early-onset cerebellar ataxia by sequencing the complete SACS gene. In a Dutch cohort of 43 index patients with ataxia onset before age 25, we identified 16 index patients (total 23 patients) with mutations in the SACS gene. Nine of them had homozygous mutations, and seven of them had compound heterozygous mutations. Retrospectively, the phenotype of patients carrying mutations was remarkably uniform: cerebellar ataxia with onset before age 13 years, lower limb spasticity and sensorimotor axonal neuropathy, and cerebellar (vermis) atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging, consistent with the core ARSACS phenotype previously described. The high rate of mutations (37%) identified in this cohort of Dutch patients suggests that ARSACS is substantially more frequent than previously estimated. We predict that the availability of SACS mutation analysis as well as an increasing awareness of the characteristic ARSACS phenotype will lead to the diagnosis of many additional patients, possibly even at a younger age.",review-article; review; journal article
19805727,SPG15 is the second most common cause of hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum.,"OBJECTIVE: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are very heterogeneous inherited neurodegenerative disorders. Our group recently identified ZFYVE26 as the gene responsible for one of the clinical and genetic entities, SPG15. Our aim was to describe its clinical and mutational spectra. METHODS: We analyzed all exons of SPG15/ZFYVE26 gene by direct sequencing in a series of 60 non-SPG11 HSP subjects with associated mental or MRI abnormalities, including 30 isolated cases. The clinical data were collected through the SPATAX network. RESULTS: We identified 13 novel truncating mutations in ZFYVE26, 12 of which segregated at the homozygous or compound heterozygous states in 8 new SPG15 families while 1 was found at the heterozygous state in a single family. Two of 3 splice site mutations were validated on mRNA of 2 patients. The SPG15 phenotype in 11 affected individuals was characterized by early onset HSP, severe progression of the disease, and mental impairment dominated by cognitive decline. Thin corpus callosum and white matter hyperintensities were MRI hallmarks of the disease in this series. CONCLUSIONS: The mutations are truncating, private, and distributed along the entire coding sequence of ZFYVE26, which complicates the analysis of this gene in clinical practice. In our series of patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia-thin corpus callosum, the largest analyzed so far, SPG15 was the second most frequent form (11.5%) after SPG11. Both forms share similar clinical and imaging presentations with very few distinctions, which are, however, insufficient to infer the molecular diagnosis when faced with a single patient.",review-article; review; journal article
19439420,CYP7B1 mutations in pure and complex forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5.,"Thirty-four different loci for hereditary spastic paraplegias have been mapped, and 16 responsible genes have been identified. Autosomal recessive forms of spastic paraplegias usually have clinically complex phenotypes but the SPG5, SPG24 and SPG28 loci are considered to be associated with 'pure' forms of the disease. Very recently, five mutations in the CYP7B1 gene, encoding a cytochrome P450 oxysterol 7-alpha hydroxylase and expressed in brain and liver, have been found in SPG5 families. We analysed the coding region and exon-intron boundaries of the CYP7B1 gene by direct sequencing in a series of 82 unrelated autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia index patients, manifesting either a pure (n = 52) or a complex form (n = 30) of the disease, and in 90 unrelated index patients with sporadic pure hereditary spastic paraplegia. We identified eight, including six novel, mutations in CYP7B1 segregating in nine families. Three of these mutations were nonsense (p.R63X, p.R112X, p.Y275X) and five were missense mutations (p.T297A, p.R417H, p.R417C, p.F470I, p.R486C), the last four clustering in exon 6 at the C-terminal end of the protein. Residue R417 appeared as a mutational hot-spot. The mean age at onset in 16 patients was 16.4 +/- 12.1 years (range 4-47 years). After a mean disease duration of 28.3 +/- 13.4 years (10-58), spasticity and functional handicap were moderate to severe in all cases. Interestingly, hereditary spastic paraplegia was pure in seven SPG5 families but complex in two. In addition, white matter hyperintensities were observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging in three patients issued from two of the seven pure families. Lastly, the index case of one family had a chronic autoimmune hepatitis while his eldest brother died from cirrhosis and liver failure. Whether this association is fortuitous remains unsolved, however. The frequency of CYP7B1 mutations were 7.3% (n = 6/82) in our series of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia families and 3.3% (n = 3/90) in our series of sporadic pure spastic paraplegia. The recent identification of CYP7B1 as the gene responsible for SPG5 highlights a novel molecular mechanism involved in hereditary spastic paraplegia determinism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; multicenter study; journal article"

12111187,"Familial isolated congenital asplenia: a rare, frequently hereditary dominant condition, often detected too late as a cause of overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis. Report of a new case and review of 31 others.","UNLABELLED: Congenital isolated asplenia may arise as a minor form of situs abnormalities or result from an unrelated specific defect of spleen development. It is a rare life-threatening condition and pneumococcal sepsis is often the first sign of the disease. We report on the case of a deceased 11-month-old girl and her father who developed recurrent pneumococcal meningitis. The fatal evolution in the girl was due to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 23 with intermediate penicillin sensitivity 4 h after amoxicillin (100 mg/kg i.v.) administration. Establishing the diagnosis of congenital isolated asplenia in the case of pneumococcal sepsis can be achieved by performing two easy and non-invasive investigations: searching for Howell-Jolly bodies on blood smears and performing ultrasound examination of the abdomen to look for the spleen. In the case of congenital isolated asplenia, use of appropriate prophylaxis could save the lives of affected children. Our review of the literature yielded 31 cases of congenital isolated asplenia. Thirteen were sporadic and 18 were familial cases involving eight families. CONCLUSION: in the case of Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis, a systematic search for Howell-Jolly bodies on blood smears and ultrasound examination of the abdomen for the presence of asplenia should be mandatory to detect isolated congenital asplenia. If asplenia is found, potentially life-saving antibiotic prophylaxis and pneumococcal vaccination should be initiated.",review; journal article; case reports
23664117,"Mutations in B3GALT6, which encodes a glycosaminoglycan linker region enzyme, cause a spectrum of skeletal and connective tissue disorders.","Proteoglycans (PGs) are a major component of the extracellular matrix in many tissues and function as structural and regulatory molecules. PGs are composed of core proteins and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains. The biosynthesis of GAGs starts with the linker region that consists of four sugar residues and is followed by repeating disaccharide units. By exome sequencing, we found that B3GALT6 encoding an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the GAG linker region is responsible for a severe skeletal dysplasia, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity type 1 (SEMD-JL1). B3GALT6 loss-of-function mutations were found in individuals with SEMD-JL1 from seven families. In a subsequent candidate gene study based on the phenotypic similarity, we found that B3GALT6 is also responsible for a connective tissue disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (progeroid form). Recessive loss-of-function mutations in B3GALT6 result in a spectrum of disorders affecting a broad range of skeletal and connective tissues characterized by lax skin, muscle hypotonia, joint dislocation, and spinal deformity. The pleiotropic phenotypes of the disorders indicate that B3GALT6 plays a critical role in a wide range of biological processes in various tissues, including skin, bone, cartilage, tendon, and ligament.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23664118,Defective initiation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis due to B3GALT6 mutations causes a pleiotropic Ehlers-Danlos-syndrome-like connective tissue disorder.,"Proteoglycans are important components of cell plasma membranes and extracellular matrices of connective tissues. They consist of glycosaminoglycan chains attached to a core protein via a tetrasaccharide linkage, whereby the addition of the third residue is catalyzed by galactosyltransferase II (β3GalT6), encoded by B3GALT6. Homozygosity mapping and candidate gene sequence analysis in three independent families, presenting a severe autosomal-recessive connective tissue disorder characterized by skin fragility, delayed wound healing, joint hyperlaxity and contractures, muscle hypotonia, intellectual disability, and a spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with bone fragility and severe kyphoscoliosis, identified biallelic B3GALT6 mutations, including homozygous missense mutations in family 1 (c.619G>C [p.Asp207His]) and family 3 (c.649G>A [p.Gly217Ser]) and compound heterozygous mutations in family 2 (c.323_344del [p.Ala108Glyfs(∗)163], c.619G>C [p.Asp207His]). The phenotype overlaps with several recessive Ehlers-Danlos variants and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint hyperlaxity. Affected individuals' fibroblasts exhibited a large decrease in ability to prime glycosaminoglycan synthesis together with impaired glycanation of the small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan decorin, confirming β3GalT6 loss of function. Dermal electron microcopy disclosed abnormalities in collagen fibril organization, in line with the important regulatory role of decorin in this process. A strong reduction in heparan sulfate level was also observed, indicating that β3GalT6 deficiency alters synthesis of both main types of glycosaminoglycans. In vitro wound healing assay revealed a significant delay in fibroblasts from two index individuals, pointing to a role for glycosaminoglycan defect in impaired wound repair in vivo. Our study emphasizes a crucial role for β3GalT6 in multiple major developmental and pathophysiological processes.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

We identified mutations in the gene encoding filamin B in four human skeletal disorders. We found homozygosity or compound heterozygosity with respect to stop-codon mutations in autosomal recessive spondylocarpotarsal syndrome (SCT, OMIM 272460) and missense mutations in individuals with autosomal dominant Larsen syndrome (OMIM 150250) and the perinatal lethal atelosteogenesis I and III phenotypes (AOI, OMIM 108720; AOIII, OMIM 108721). We found that filamin B is expressed in human growth plate chondrocytes and in the developing vertebral bodies in the mouse. These data indicate an unexpected role in vertebral segmentation, joint formation and endochondral ossification for this ubiquitously expressed cytoskeletal protein.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

The genetic etiology for most patients with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis and for all patients with testicular regression syndrome (TRS) is unknown. METHODS:We performed exome and/or Sanger sequencing in 145 individuals with 46,XY DSD of unknown etiology including gonadal dysgenesis and TRS. RESULTS:Thirteen children carried heterozygous missense pathogenic variants involving the RNA helicase DHX37, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis. Enrichment of rare/novel DHX37 missense variants in 46,XY DSD is highly significant compared with controls (P value = 5.8 × 10-10). Five variants are de novo (P value = 1.5 × 10-5). Twelve variants are clustered in two highly conserved functional domains and were specifically associated with gonadal dysgenesis and TRS. Consistent with a role in early testis development, DHX37 is expressed specifically in somatic cells of the developing human and mouse testis. CONCLUSION:DHX37 pathogenic variants are a new cause of an autosomal dominant form of 46,XY DSD, including gonadal dysgenesis and TRS, showing that these conditions are part of a clinical spectrum. This raises the possibility that some forms of DSD may be a ribosomopathy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
17236129,Complex inheritance pattern resembling autosomal recessive inheritance involving a microdeletion in thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome.,"Thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome is characterized by hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and bilateral radial aplasia in the presence of both thumbs. Other frequent associations are congenital heart disease and a high incidence of cow's milk intolerance. Evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance comes from families with several affected individuals born to unaffected parents, but several other observations argue for a more complex pattern of inheritance. In this study, we describe a common interstitial microdeletion of 200 kb on chromosome 1q21.1 in all 30 investigated patients with TAR syndrome, detected by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. Analysis of the parents revealed that this deletion occurred de novo in 25% of affected individuals. Intriguingly, inheritance of the deletion along the maternal line as well as the paternal line was observed. The absence of this deletion in a cohort of control individuals argues for a specific role played by the microdeletion in the pathogenesis of TAR syndrome. We hypothesize that TAR syndrome is associated with a deletion on chromosome 1q21.1 but that the phenotype develops only in the presence of an additional as-yet-unknown modifier (mTAR).","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Laurence-Moon syndrome presents similarly, though with progressive spinocerebellar ataxia and spastic paraplegia and without trichomegaly. Both recessively inherited disorders have no known genetic cause.Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify the genetic causes of these disorders. Mutations were functionally validated in zebrafish pnpla6 morphants. Embryonic expression was evaluated via in situ hybridisation in human embryonic sections. Human neurohistopathology was performed to characterise cerebellar degeneration. Enzymatic activities were measured in patient-derived fibroblast cell lines.Eight mutations in six families with Oliver-McFarlane or Laurence-Moon syndrome were identified in the PNPLA6 gene, which encodes neuropathy target esterase (NTE). PNPLA6 expression was found in the developing human eye, pituitary and brain. In zebrafish, the pnpla6 curly-tailed morphant phenotype was fully rescued by wild-type human PNPLA6 mRNA and not by mutation-harbouring mRNAs. NTE enzymatic activity was significantly reduced in fibroblast cells derived from individuals with Oliver-McFarlane syndrome. Intriguingly, adult brain histology from a patient with highly overlapping features of Oliver-McFarlane and Laurence-Moon syndromes revealed extensive cerebellar degeneration and atrophy.Previously, PNPLA6 mutations have been associated with spastic paraplegia type 39, Gordon-Holmes syndrome and Boucher-Neuhäuser syndromes. Discovery of these additional PNPLA6-opathies further elucidates a spectrum of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders associated with NTE impairment and suggests a unifying mechanism with diagnostic and prognostic importance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

SCD can either be sporadic or familial, and can be inherited in either autosomal dominant or recessive modes.

Here, we have sequenced DLL3 in a series of SCD cases and identified 12 mutations in a further 10 families. These include 10 novel mutations in exons 4-8, comprising nonsense, missense, frameshift, splicing, and in frame insertion mutations that are predicted to result in either the truncation of the mature protein in the extracellular domain, or affect highly conserved amino acid residues in the epidermal growth factor-like repeats of the protein. The affected cases represent diverse ethnic backgrounds and six come from traditionally consanguineous communities. In all affected subjects, the radiological phenotype is abnormal segmentation throughout the entire vertebral column with smooth outlines to the vertebral bodies in childhood, for which we suggest the term ""pebble beach sign"".

29765785,Spondylocostal Dysostosis: A Literature Review and Case Report with Long-Term Follow-Up of a Conservatively Managed Patient.,"Introduction:Patients with spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD) have congenital spine and rib deformities associated with frequently severe thoracic insufficiency and respiratory compromise. The literature is largely composed of case reports and small cohorts, and there is little information regarding adults with this condition. In this report, we describe the natural history of a conservatively treated patient and include quality-of-life issues such as childbearing, athletic participation, and occupational selection. Case Presentation:We present a patient with SCD who was conservatively treated by a single physician from birth for 31 years. Our patient was capable of a reasonably good quality of life through adulthood, including participation in gymnastics and employment. At age 18, she became pregnant and subsequently terminated the pregnancy due to obstetrical concerns for compromised respiration. She has had intermittent respiratory complaints and occasionally experiences dyspnea with exertion, but this only has limited her during certain activities in the past three years. Currently, she takes naproxen for chronic back pain with periodic exacerbations. Discussion:Other cases in the literature have described adult SCD patients who have received nonoperative treatment and achieved a wide range of functional outcomes. This provides some limited evidence to suggest that select patients with SCD may be treated conservatively and achieve a reasonable quality of life. However, close clinical follow-up with these patients is recommended, particularly early on, considering the high rates of infant morbidity and mortality. Chest physiotherapy and early pulmonary care have been associated with favorable outcomes in infancy. Surgery to increase thoracic volume and correct scoliosis has been shown in some cases to improve respiratory function. Treatment depends on the degree of thoracic insufficiency and quality of life. The natural history of SCD remains largely unknown, but some patients are capable of relatively favorable life spans, employment, and participation in athletics.",case reports; case-report

We have recently mapped a gene for the autosomal recessive form of WMS to chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2, in a 12.4-cM interval. Here, we report null mutations in a member of the extracellular matrix protease family, the gene encoding ADAMTS10, a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs. A total of three distinct mutations were identified in two consanguineous families and in one sporadic WMS case, including one nonsense mutation (R237X) and two splice mutations (1190+1G-->A and 810+1G-->A). ADAMTS10 expression studies using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, northern blot, and dot-blot analyses showed that ADAMTS10 is expressed in skin, fetal chondrocytes, and fetal and adult heart. Moreover, electron microscopy and immunological studies of the skin fibroblasts from the patients confirmed impairment of the extracellular matrix. We conclude, therefore, that ADAMTS10 plays a major role in growth and in skin, lens, and heart development in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
9153281,Identification of two mutations in human xanthine dehydrogenase gene responsible for classical type I xanthinuria.,"Hereditary xanthinuria is classified into three categories. Classical xanthinuria type I lacks only xanthine dehydrogenase activity, while type II and molybdenum cofactor deficiency also lack one or two additional enzyme activities. In the present study, we examined four individuals with classical xanthinuria to discover the cause of the enzyme deficiency at the molecular level. One subject had a C to T base substitution at nucleotide 682 that should cause a CGA (Arg) to TGA (Ter) nonsense substitution at codon 228. The duodenal mucosa from the subject had no xanthine dehydrogenase protein while the mRNA level was not reduced. The two subjects who were siblings with type I xanthinuria were homozygous concerning this mutation, while another subject was found to contain the same mutation in a heterozygous state. The last subject who was also with type I xanthinuria had a deletion of C at nucleotide 2567 in cDNA that should generate a termination codon from nucleotide 2783. This subject was homozygous for the mutation and the level of mRNA in the duodenal mucosa from the subject was not reduced. Thus, in three subjects with type I xanthinuria, the primary genetic defects were confirmed to be in the xanthine dehydrogenase gene.",research-article; journal article; case reports

Whole-exome sequencing on five previously reported cases identified PIGL, the de-N-acetylase required for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor formation, as a strong candidate. Furthermore, cell lines derived from these cases had significantly reduced levels of the two GPI anchor markers, CD59 and a GPI-binding toxin, aerolysin (FLAER), confirming the pathogenicity of the mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

26143542,Visual Function in Carriers of X-Linked Retinitis Pigmentosa.,"To determine the frequency and severity of visual function loss in female carriers of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP).Case series.Two hundred seventy-six XLRP carriers with cross-sectional data (n = 242) and longitudinal data (n = 34; median follow-up, 16 years; follow-up range, 3-37 years). Half of the carriers were from RPGR- or RP2-genotyped families.Retrospective medical records review.Visual acuities, visual field areas, final dark adaptation thresholds, and full-field electroretinography (ERG) responses to 0.5-Hz and 30-Hz flashes.In genotyped families, 40% of carriers showed a baseline abnormality on at least 1 of 3 psychophysical tests. There was a wide range of function among carriers. For example, 3 of 121 (2%) genotyped carriers were legally blind because of poor visual acuity, some as young as 35 years. Visual fields were less affected than visual acuity. In all carriers, the average ERG amplitude to 30-Hz flashes was approximately 50% of normal, and the average exponential rate of amplitude loss over time was half that of XLRP males (3.7%/year vs. 7.4%/year, respectively). Among obligate carriers with affected fathers, sons, or both, 53 of 55 (96%) had abnormal baseline ERG results. Some carriers who initially had completely normal fundi in both eyes went on to experience moderately decreased vision, although not legal blindness. Among carriers with RPGR mutations, those with mutations in ORF15, compared with those in exons 1-14, had worse final dark adaptation thresholds and lower 0.5-Hz and 30-Hz ERG amplitudes.Most carriers of XLRP had mildly or moderately reduced visual function but rarely became legally blind. In most cases, obligate carriers could be identified by ERG testing. Carriers of RPGR ORF15 mutations tended to have worse visual function than carriers of RPGR exon 1 through 14 mutations. Because XLRP carrier ERG amplitudes and decay rates over time were on average half of those of affected men, these observations were consistent with the Lyon hypothesis of random X-inactivation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17325176,Disease course of patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa due to RPGR gene mutations.,"PURPOSE: To measure the rates of visual acuity, visual field, and ERG loss in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa due to RPGR mutations and to determine whether these rates differ from those of patients with dominant retinitis pigmentosa due to RHO mutations. METHODS: Snellen visual acuities, Goldmann visual field areas (V4e white test light), and 30 Hz (cone) full-field ERG amplitudes were recorded for an average of 9.8 years in 113 patients with RPGR mutations. After censoring data to eliminate ceiling and floor effects, we used longitudinal regression to estimate mean rates of change and to compare these rates with those of a previously studied cohort of 134 patients with dominant retinitis pigmentosa due to RHO mutations, who were followed for an average of 8.9 years. Survival analysis was used to compare the age distribution of legal blindness in these two groups. To explain group differences in visual acuity, optical coherence tomograms were recorded in some patients to visualize central retinal structure. RESULTS: Mean annual exponential rates of decline for the patients with RPGR mutations were 4.0% for visual acuity, 4.7% for visual field area, and 7.1% for ERG amplitude. Each of these rates was significantly different from zero (P < 0.001). The rates of visual acuity and visual field loss were significantly faster than the corresponding rates in the RHO patients (1.6%, P < 0.001 and 2.9%, P = 0.002, respectively), whereas the rate of ERG amplitude loss was comparable to that in the RHO patients (7.7%, P = 0.39). The median age of legal blindness was 32 years younger in the RPGR patients than in the RHO patients, due primarily to loss of visual acuity rather than to loss of visual field. Loss of acuity in RPGR patients appeared to be associated with foveal thinning. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa due to RPGR mutations lose visual acuity and visual field more rapidly than do patients with dominant retinitis pigmentosa due to RHO mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
7783167,Male neonatal death and progressive weakness and immune deficiency in females: an unknown X linked condition.,"We report a family with an undiagnosed X linked condition. The grandmother, two of her three daughters, and one of her grand-daughters have a slowly progressive proximal weakness, brisk reflexes, poor bladder function, static reduced night vision, and IgG2 deficiency. The diagnosis of the three living symptomatic females was ""hereditary spastic paraplegia plus"". They have lost five male children who died in the neonatal period of severe hypotonia and were of low birth weight. Investigations have not led to a unifying diagnosis: myotonic dystrophy, NARP, and X linked hyper IgM were specifically eliminated. Using the hypothesis that the condition is X linked dominant, haplotype analysis of the family suggests that the disease locus is within Xq26-qter. This entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of families presenting with severe neonatal hypotonia in males and females with symptoms suggestive of complex hereditary spastic paraplegia.",research-article; journal article
24316281,Pathophysiology of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.,"Currently the molecular basis for the clinical heterogeneity of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is poorly understood. The genetic bases for all different phenotypic variants of X-ALD are mutations in the gene encoding the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCD1 (formerly adrenoleukodystrophy protein, ALDP). ABCD1 transports CoA-activated very long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol into the peroxisome for degradation. The phenotypic variability is remarkable ranging from cerebral inflammatory demyelination of childhood onset, leading to death within a few years, to adults remaining pre-symptomatic through more than five decades. There is no general genotype-phenotype correlation in X-ALD. The default manifestation of mutations in ABCD1 is adrenomyeloneuropathy, a slowly progressive dying-back axonopathy affecting both ascending and descending spinal cord tracts as well as in some cases, a peripheral neuropathy. In about 60% of male X-ALD patients, either in childhood (35-40%) or in adulthood (20%), an initial, clinically silent, myelin destabilization results in conversion to a devastating, rapidly progressive form of cerebral inflammatory demyelination. Here, ABCD1 remains a susceptibility gene, necessary but not sufficient for inflammatory demyelination to occur. Although the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids appears to be essential for the pathomechanism of all phenotypes, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes are fundamentally different. Cell autonomous processes such as oxidative stress and energy shortage in axons as well as non-cell autonomous processes involving axon-glial interactions seem pertinent to the dying-back axonopathy. Various dynamic mechanisms may underlie the initiation of inflammation, the altered immune reactivity, the propagation of inflammation, as well as the mechanisms leading to the arrest of inflammation after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in these events is required for the development of urgently needed therapeutics.","other; research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
21484992,Deletion of the immunoglobulin domain of IL1RAPL1 results in nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability associated with behavioral problems and mild dysmorphism.,"X-Linked intellectual disability accounts for a significant fraction of males with cognitive impairment. Many of these males present with a non-syndromic phenotype and presently mutations in 17 X-linked genes are associated with these patients. Mutations in IL1RAPL1 have been found in multiple families with non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. All of the published mutations predict loss of function of the protein. We have identified an additional two families with deletions of a portion of the gene that give rise to cognitive impairment, as well as some behavioral problems and mild dysmorphism. Our clinical findings better delineate the phenotypic spectrum associated with IL1RAPL1 mutations.","journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
28055140,EIF2S3 Mutations Associated with Severe X-Linked Intellectual Disability Syndrome MEHMO.,"Impairment of translation initiation and its regulation within the integrated stress response (ISR) and related unfolded-protein response has been identified as a cause of several multisystemic syndromes. Here, we link MEHMO syndrome, whose genetic etiology was unknown, to this group of disorders. MEHMO is a rare X-linked syndrome characterized by profound intellectual disability, epilepsy, hypogonadism and hypogenitalism, microcephaly, and obesity. We have identified a C-terminal frameshift mutation (Ile465Serfs) in the EIF2S3 gene in three families with MEHMO syndrome and a novel maternally inherited missense EIF2S3 variant (c.324T>A; p.Ser108Arg) in another male patient with less severe clinical symptoms. The EIF2S3 gene encodes the γ subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), crucial for initiation of protein synthesis and regulation of the ISR. Studies in patient fibroblasts confirm increased ISR activation due to the Ile465Serfs mutation and functional assays in yeast demonstrate that the Ile465Serfs mutation impairs eIF2γ function to a greater extent than tested missense mutations, consistent with the more severe clinical phenotype of the Ile465Serfs male mutation carriers. Thus, we propose that more severe EIF2S3 mutations cause the full MEHMO phenotype, while less deleterious mutations cause a milder form of the syndrome with only a subset of the symptoms.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

10484772,Coats' disease of the retina (unilateral retinal telangiectasis) caused by somatic mutation in the NDP gene: a role for norrin in retinal angiogenesis.,"Coats' disease is characterized by abnormal retinal vascular development (so-called 'retinal telangiectasis') which results in massive intraretinal and subretinal lipid accumulation (exudative retinal detachment). The classical form of Coats' disease is almost invariably isolated, unilateral and seen in males. A female with a unilateral variant of Coats' disease gave birth to a son affected by Norrie disease. Both carried a missense mutation within the NDP gene on chromosome Xp11.2. Subsequently analysis of the retinas of nine enucleated eyes from males with Coats' disease demonstrated in one a somatic mutation in the NDP gene which was not present within non-retinal tissue. We suggest that Coats' telangiectasis is secondary to somatic mutation in the NDP gene which results in a deficiency of norrin (the protein product of the NDP gene) within the developing retina. This supports recent observations that the protein is critical for normal retinal vasculogenesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

17632775,Filamin A mutation is one cause of FG syndrome.,"FG syndrome was originally described as a rare syndromic cause of X-linked mental retardation associated with congenital heart disease, anal atresia, inguinal hernia, cryptorchidism, and other anomalies. However, recent reports have highlighted the more common milder presentation which has for cardinal features developmental delay, particularly in speech, neonatal hypotonia, relative macrocephaly, dysmorphic facial features, severe constipation, and few if any congenital malformations. Thus far, five separate loci have been identified on the X chromosome but attempts at finding the responsible gene have not yet been successful. Given that one putative FG locus (FGS2) is situated at Xq28, which is the location of the Filamin A gene (FLNA), and that a Filamin A mutation was reported in a boy with facial dysmorphism and constipation, it was hypothesized that Filamin A mutations could be one cause of FG syndrome. Indeed, a previously unreported FLNA missense mutation (P1291L) was detected in our patient with FG syndrome, thus supporting this hypothesis and indicating that FG syndrome could now be added to the list of Filamin A-related disorders. Filamin A studies in other children with FG syndrome would help to confirm this association.",journal article; case reports

17236139,"Mutations in CUL4B, which encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit, cause an X-linked mental retardation syndrome associated with aggressive outbursts, seizures, relative macrocephaly, central obesity, hypogonadism, pes cavus, and tremor.","We have identified three truncating, two splice-site, and three missense variants at conserved amino acids in the CUL4B gene on Xq24 in 8 of 250 families with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). During affected subjects' adolescence, a syndrome emerged with delayed puberty, hypogonadism, relative macrocephaly, moderate short stature, central obesity, unprovoked aggressive outbursts, fine intention tremor, pes cavus, and abnormalities of the toes. This syndrome was first described by Cazebas et al., in a family that was included in our study and that carried a CUL4B missense variant. CUL4B is a ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit implicated in the regulation of several biological processes, and CUL4B is the first XLMR gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The relatively high frequency of CUL4B mutations in this series indicates that it is one of the most commonly mutated genes underlying XLMR and suggests that its introduction into clinical diagnostics should be a high priority.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural; case-report"
17273978,"Mutation in CUL4B, which encodes a member of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, causes X-linked mental retardation.","We reevaluated a previously reported family with an X-linked mental retardation syndrome and attempted to identify the underlying genetic defect. Screening of candidate genes in a 10-Mb region on Xq25 implicated CUL4B as the causative gene. CUL4B encodes a scaffold protein that organizes a cullin-RING (really interesting new gene) ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex in ubiquitylation. A base substitution, c.1564C-->T, converted a codon for arginine into a premature termination codon, p.R388X, and rendered the truncated peptide completely devoid of the C-terminal catalytic domain. The nonsense mutation also results in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in patients. In peripheral leukocytes of obligate carriers, a strong selection against cells expressing the mutant allele results in an extremely skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern. Our findings point to the functional significance of CUL4B in cognition and in other aspects of human development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26522830,Compound heterozygous mutations in the noncoding RNU4ATAC cause Roifman Syndrome by disrupting minor intron splicing.,"Roifman Syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by growth retardation, cognitive delay, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and antibody deficiency. Here we utilize whole-genome sequencing of Roifman Syndrome patients to reveal compound heterozygous rare variants that disrupt highly conserved positions of the RNU4ATAC small nuclear RNA gene, a minor spliceosome component that is essential for minor intron splicing. Targeted sequencing confirms allele segregation in six cases from four unrelated families. RNU4ATAC rare variants have been recently reported to cause microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism, type I (MOPD1), whose phenotype is distinct from Roifman Syndrome. Strikingly, all six of the Roifman Syndrome cases have one variant that overlaps MOPD1-implicated structural elements, while the other variant overlaps a highly conserved structural element not previously implicated in disease. RNA-seq analysis confirms extensive and specific defects of minor intron splicing. Available allele frequency data suggest that recessive genetic disorders caused by RNU4ATAC rare variants may be more prevalent than previously reported.",research-article; journal article
22043478,The male phenotype in osteopathia striata congenita with cranial sclerosis.,"Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OSCS) is an X-linked disease caused by truncating mutations in WTX. Females exhibit sclerotic striations on the long bones, cranial sclerosis, and craniofacial dysmorphism. Males with OSCS have significant skeletal sclerosis, do not have striations but do display a more severe phenotype commonly associated with gross structural malformations, patterning defects, and significant pre- and postnatal lethality. The recent description of mutations in WTX underlying OSCS has led to the identification of a milder, survivable phenotype in males. Individuals with this presentation can have, in addition to skeletal sclerosis, Hirschsprung disease, joint contractures, cardiomyopathy, and neuromuscular anomalies. A diagnosis of OSCS should be considered in males with macrocephaly, skeletal sclerosis that is most marked in the cranium and the absence of metaphyseal striations. The observation of striations in males may be indicative of a WTX mutation in a mosaic state supporting the contention that this sign in females is indicative of the differential lyonization of cells in the osteoblastic lineage.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

In contrast to other genes involved in XLMR, ARX expression is specific to the telencephalon and ventral thalamus. Notably there is an absence of expression in the cerebellum throughout development and also in adult.

19200522,A missense mutation in CASK causes FG syndrome in an Italian family.,"First described in 1974, FG syndrome (FGS) is an X-linked multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation (MCA/MR) disorder, characterized by high clinical variability and genetic heterogeneity. Five loci (FGS1-5) have so far been linked to this phenotype on the X chromosome, but only one gene, MED12, has been identified to date. Mutations in this gene account for a restricted number of FGS patients with a more distinctive phenotype, referred to as the Opitz-Kaveggia phenotype. We report here that a p.R28L (c.83G-->T) missense mutation in CASK causes FGS phenotype in an Italian family previously mapped to Xp11.4-p11.3 (FGS4). The identified missense mutation cosegregates with the phenotype in this family and is absent in 1000 control X chromosomes of the same ethnic origin. An extensive analysis of CASK protein functions as well as structural and dynamic studies performed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation did not reveal significant alterations induced by the p.R28L substitution. However, we observed a partial skipping of the exon 2 of CASK, presumably a consequence of improper recognition of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) induced by the c.83G-->T transversion. CASK is a multidomain scaffold protein highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) with specific localization to the synapses, where it forms large signaling complexes regulating neurotransmission. We suggest that the observed phenotype is most likely a consequence of an altered CASK expression profile during embryogenesis, brain development, and differentiation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
12858175,Identification of acquired somatic mutations in the gene encoding chromatin-remodeling factor ATRX in the alpha-thalassemia myelodysplasia syndrome (ATMDS).,"Inherited mutations of specific genes have elucidated the normal roles of the proteins they encode by relating specific mutations to particular phenotypes. But many potentially informative mutations in such genes are lethal early in development. Consequently, inherited mutations may not reflect all the functional roles of such proteins. Acquired, somatic defects should reflect a wider spectrum of mutations because they are not prone to negative selection in development. It has been difficult to identify such mutations so far, but microarray analysis provides a new opportunity to do so. Using this approach, we have shown that in individuals with myelodysplasia associated with alpha-thalassemia (ATMDS), somatic mutations of the gene encoding the chromatin remodeling factor ATRX cause an unexpectedly severe hematological phenotype compared with the wide spectrum of inherited mutations affecting this gene. These findings cast new light on this pleiotropic cofactor, which appears to be an essential component rather than a mere facilitator of globin gene expression.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15358626,Acquired alpha-thalassemia in association with myelodysplastic syndrome and other hematologic malignancies.,"Abnormalities of hemoglobin synthesis are usually inherited but may also arise as a secondary manifestation of another disease, most commonly hematologic neoplasia. Acquired hemoglobin disorders can be seen in any population and are not restricted to areas of the world with high incidences of inherited hemoglobinopathies. In fact, the acquired hemoglobinopathies may be more readily recognized where inherited hemoglobin abnormalities are rare and less likely to cause diagnostic confusion. Acquired alpha-thalassemia is the best characterized of the acquired red blood cell disorders in patients with hematologic malignancy, and it is almost always associated with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). At least 2 molecular mechanisms for acquired alpha-thalassemia are now recognized: acquired deletion of the alpha-globin gene cluster limited to the neoplastic clone and, more commonly, inactivating somatic mutations of the trans-acting chromatin-associated factor ATRX, which cause dramatic down-regulation of alpha-globin gene expression. Here we review the clinical, hematologic, and molecular genetic features of alpha-thalassemia arising in a clonal myeloid disorder, and we discuss howATRX might affect gene expression in normal and abnormal hematopoiesis through epigenetic mechanisms.",review; journal article
16055928,RPGR is mutated in patients with a complex X linked phenotype combining primary ciliary dyskinesia and retinitis pigmentosa.,"INTRODUCTION: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disease classically transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait and characterised by recurrent airway infections due to abnormal ciliary structure and function. To date, only two autosomal genes, DNAI1 and DNAH5 encoding axonemal dynein chains, have been shown to cause PCD with defective outer dynein arms. Here, we investigated one non-consanguineous family in which a woman with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) gave birth to two boys with a complex phenotype combining PCD, discovered in early childhood and characterised by partial dynein arm defects, and RP that occurred secondarily. The family history prompted us to search for an X linked gene that could account for both conditions. RESULTS: We found perfect segregation of the disease phenotype with RP3 associated markers (Xp21.1). Analysis of the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator gene (RPGR) located at this locus revealed a mutation (631_IVS6+9del) in the two boys and their mother. As shown by study of RPGR transcripts expressed in nasal epithelial cells, this intragenic deletion, which leads to activation of a cryptic donor splice site, predicts a severely truncated protein. CONCLUSION: These data provide the first clear demonstration of X linked transmission of PCD. This unusual mode of inheritance of PCD in patients with particular phenotypic features (that is, partial dynein arm defects and association with RP), which should modify the current management of families affected by PCD or RP, unveils the importance of RPGR in the proper development of both respiratory ciliary structures and connecting cilia of photoreceptors.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
12807962,A new genetic locus for X linked progressive cone-rod dystrophy.,"X linked progressive cone-rod dystrophy (COD) is a retinal disease primarily affecting the cone photoreceptors. The disease is genetically heterogeneous and two loci, COD1 (Xp21.1-11.4) and COD2 (Xq27.2-28), have been previously identified. COD1 was recently shown to be caused by mutations in RPGR exon ORF15 (Xp21.1), the gene that is also responsible for RP3 type retinitis pigmentosa. In this study, we performed a linkage study to map the disease gene in a large Finnish family with X linked cone-rod dystrophy, using a panel of 39 X chromosomal markers. Several recombinations between the disease gene and markers in the Xp21.1-p11.4 region have excluded COD1 as a candidate locus in this family. Consistent with the linkage results, no mutation was detected by direct PCR sequencing of the coding region of RPGR, including exon ORF15. The COD2 locus has been also excluded as the site of the gene on the basis of negative lod score values obtained for COD2 linked markers. The disease causing gene of the studied COD family has been localised between the markers DXS10042 and DXS8060 on Xp11.4-q13.1. Positive pairwise lod scores >3 were obtained for markers DXS993, MAOB, DXS1055, and DXS1194. Since this locus is distinct from the previously identified two loci, COD1 and COD2, our results establish a new third genetic locus for X linked progressive cone-rod dystrophy and further expands our knowledge about the genetic heterogeneity underlying this disease entity.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
16505158,"X linked cone-rod dystrophy, CORDX3, is caused by a mutation in the CACNA1F gene.","BACKGROUND: X linked cone-rod dystrophy (CORDX) is a recessive retinal disease characterised by progressive dysfunction of photoreceptors. It is genetically heterogeneous, showing linkage to three X chromosomal loci. CORDX1 is caused by mutations in the RPGR gene (Xp21.1), CORDX2 is located on Xq27.2-28, and we recently localised CORDX3 to Xp11.4-q13.1. We aimed to identify the causative gene behind the CORDX3 phenotype. METHODS: All 48 exons of the CACNA1F gene were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing. RNA from cultured lymphoblasts and peripheral blood activated T lymphocytes was analysed by RT-PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: A novel CACNA1F mutation, IVS28-1 GCGTC>TGG, in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 was identified. Messenger RNA studies indicated that the identified mutation leads to altered splicing of the CACNA1F transcript. Aberrant splice variants are predicted to result in premature termination and deletions of the encoded protein, Ca(v)1.4 alpha1 subunit. CONCLUSION: CACNA1F mutations cause the retinal disorder, incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2), although mutations have also been detected in patients with divergent diagnoses. Our results indicate that yet another phenotype, CORDX3, is caused by a mutation in CACNA1F. Clinically, CORDX3 shares some features with CSNB2 but is distinguishable from CSNB2 in that it is progressive, can begin in adulthood, has no nystagmus or hyperopic refraction, has only low grade astigmatism, and in dark adaptation lacks cone threshold and has small or no elevation of rod threshold. Considering all features, CORDX3 is more similar to other X chromosomal cone-rod dystrophies than to CSNB2.","letter; research support, non-u.s. gov't; case-report"
29960046,Expanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with OPHN1 variants.,"Genomic sequencing has allowed for the characterization of new gene-to-disease relationships, as well as the identification of variants in established disease genes in patients who do not fit the classically-described phenotype. This is especially true in rare syndromes where the clinical spectrum is not fully known. After a lengthy and costly diagnostic odyssey, patients with atypical presentations may be left with many questions even after a genetic diagnosis is identified. We present a 22-year old male with hypotonia, developmental delay, seizure disorder, and dysmorphic facial features who enrolled in our rare disease research center at 18 years of age, where exome sequencing revealed a novel, likely pathogenic variant in the OPHN1 gene. Through efforts by the study team and collaborations with the larger genetics community, contacts with other families with OPHN1 variants were eventually made, and outreach by these families expanded the patient network. This partnership between families and researchers facilitated the gathering of phenotypic information, allowing for comparison of clinical presentations among three new patients and those previously reported in the literature. These comparisons found previously unreported commonalities between the newly identified patients, such as the presence of otitis media and the lack of genitourinary abnormalities (i.e. hypoplastic scrotum, microphallus, cryptorchidism), which had been noted to be classic features of patients with OPHN1 variants. As genomic sequencing becomes more common, connecting patients with novel variants in the same gene will facilitate phenotypic analysis and continue to refine the clinical spectrum associated with that gene.",research-article; journal article; case reports
21910217,X-linked VACTERL with hydrocephalus syndrome: further delineation of the phenotype caused by FANCB mutations.,"X-linked VACTERL-hydrocephalus syndrome (X-linked VACTERL-H) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in the gene FANCB which underlies Fanconi Anemia (FA) complementation group B. Cells from affected males have increased chromosome breakage on exposure to DNA cross-linking agents. Only five FANCB mutations found in six affected males, including an affected uncle and nephew, have been reported. We have identified FANCB mutations in a further four affected families. The VACTERL-H phenotype segregates as an X-linked recessive trait in three of these. Each mutation is predicted to truncate the FANCB open reading frame and results in highly skewed X-inactivation in unaffected carrier females. Phenotypic data were available on six affected males. Comparison of the clinical findings in our patients with published clinical data (total 12 patients) shows that ventriculomegaly, bilateral absent thumbs and radii, vertebral defects, renal agenesis, and growth retardation are the major phenotypic signs in affected males. Less frequent are brain, pituitary, ear and eye malformations, gastrointestinal atresias (esophageal, duodenal and anal), tracheoesophageal fistula, lung segmentation defects, and small genitalia. Three of six of our patients survived the perinatal period. One boy lived up to 2 years 10 months but developed aplastic anemia and died of renal failure. These data show that loss-of-function FANCB mutations result in a recognizable, multiple malformation phenotype in hemizygous males for which we propose clinical criteria to aid diagnosis.",journal article
15488219,Association between mutations in a thyroid hormone transporter and severe X-linked psychomotor retardation.,"Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a thyroid hormone transporter, the gene of which is located on the X chromosome. We tested whether mutations in MCT8 cause severe psychomotor retardation and high serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations in five unrelated young boys. The coding sequence of MCT8 was analysed by PCR and direct sequencing of its six exons. In two patients, gene deletions of 2.4 kb and 24 kb were recorded and in three patients missense mutations Ala150Val, Arg171 stop, and Leu397Pro were identified. We suggest that this novel syndrome of X-linked psychomotor retardation is due to a defect in T3 entry into neurons through MCT8, resulting in impaired T3 action and metabolism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15980113,Decreased cellular uptake and metabolism in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) due to a novel mutation in the MCT8 thyroid hormone transporter.,"We report a novel 1 bp deletion (c.1834delC) in the MCT8 gene in a large Brazilian family with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), an X linked condition characterised by severe mental retardation and neurological dysfunction. The c.1834delC segregates with the disease in this family and it was not present in 100 control chromosomes, further confirming its pathogenicity. This mutation causes a frameshift and the inclusion of 64 additional amino acids in the C-terminal region of the protein. Pathogenic mutations in the MCT8 gene, which encodes a thyroid hormone transporter, results in elevated serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels, which were confirmed in four affected males of this family, while normal levels were found among obligate carriers. Through in vitro functional assays, we showed that this mutation decreases cellular T3 uptake and intracellular T3 metabolism. Therefore, the severe neurological defects present in the patients are due not only to deficiency of intracellular T3, but also to altered metabolism of T3 in central neurones. In addition, the severe muscle hypoplasia observed in most AHDS patients may be a consequence of high serum T3 levels.","letter; research support, non-u.s. gov't; case-report"
18697827,"Mutations in JARID1C are associated with X-linked mental retardation, short stature and hyperreflexia.","Mutations in the JARID1C (Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1C) gene were recently associated with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Mutations in this gene are reported to be one of the relatively more common causes of XLMR with a frequency of approximately 3% in males with proven or probable XLMR. The JARID1C protein functions as a histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase and is involved in the demethylation of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2.Mutation analysis of the JARID1C gene was conducted in the following cohorts: probands from 23 XLMR families linked to Xp11.2, 92 males with mental retardation and short stature, and 172 probands from small XLMR families with no linkage information.Four novel mutations consisting of two missense mutations, p.A77T and p.V504M, and two frame shift mutations, p.E468fsX2 and p.R1481fsX9, were identified in males with mental retardation. Two of the mutations, p.V504M and p.E468fsX2, are located in the JmjC domain of the JARID1C gene where no previous mutations have been reported. Additional studies showed that the missense mutation, p.V504M, was a de novo event on the grandpaternal X chromosome of the family. Clinical findings of the nine affected males from the four different families included mental retardation (100%), short stature (55%), hyperreflexia (78%), seizures (33%) and aggressive behaviour (44%). The degree of mental retardation consisted of mild (25%), moderate (12%) and severe (63%).Based on the clinical observations, male patients with mental retardation, short stature and hyperreflexia should be considered candidates for mutations in the JARID1C gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19578035,Enhancer deletions of the SHOX gene as a frequent cause of short stature: the essential role of a 250 kb downstream regulatory domain.,"BACKGROUND: Mutations and deletions of the homeobox transcription factor gene SHOX are known to cause short stature. The authors have analysed SHOX enhancer regions in a large cohort of short stature patients to study the importance of regulatory regions in developmentally relevant genes like SHOX. METHODS: The authors tested for the presence of copy number variations in the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosomes in 735 individuals with idiopathic short stature and compared the results to 58 cases with Leri-Weill syndrome and 100 normal height controls, using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), microsatellites, and multiplex ligand dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis. RESULTS: A total of 31/735 (4.2%) microdeletions were identified in the pseudoautosomal region in patients with idiopathic short stature; eight of these microdeletions (8/31; 26%) involved only enhancer sequences residing a considerable distance away from the gene. In 58 Leri-Weill syndrome patients, a total of 29 microdeletions were identified; almost half of these (13/29; 45%) involve enhancer sequences and leave the SHOX gene intact. These deletions were absent in 100 control persons. CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that enhancer deletions in the SHOX gene region are a relatively frequent cause of growth failure in patients with idiopathic short stature and Leri-Weill syndrome. The data highlights the growing recognition that regulatory sequences are of crucial importance in the genome when diagnosing and understanding the aetiology of disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Mutations in three genes (NIPBL, SMC1A, and SMC3) of the cohesin complex and its regulators have been found in affected patients. Here, we present clinical and molecular characterization of 30 unrelated patients with CdLS. Eleven patients had mutations in NIPBL (37%) and three patients had mutations in SMC1A (10%), giving an overall rate of mutations of 47%. Several patients shared the same mutation in NIPBL (p.R827GfsX2) but had variable phenotypes, indicating the influence of modifiers in CdLS. Patients with NIPBL mutations had a more severe phenotype than those with mutations in SMC1A or those without identified mutations. However, a high incidence of palate defects was noted in patients with SMC1A mutations. In addition, we observed a similar phenotype in both male and female patients with SMC1A mutations. Finally, we report the first patient with an SMC1A mutation and the Sandifer complex.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
22106055,In-frame multi-exon deletion of SMC1A in a severely affected female with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome.,"Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by dysmorphic facial features, cleft palate, limb defects, growth retardation, and developmental delay. Approximately 60% of patients with CdLS have an identifiable mutation in the NIPBL gene at 5p13.2. Recently, an X-linked form of CdLS with a generally milder phenotype was attributed to mutation of the structural maintenance of chromosomes 1A gene (SMC1A) at Xp11.22. Relatively few CdLS patients with mutations in SMC1A are known; female carriers have minor facial dysmorphism and cognitive deficiency without major structural abnormalities. To date, all mutations identified in SMC1A are missense or small in-frame deletions that preserve the open reading frame of the gene and likely have a dominant-negative effect. We report on a female with monosomy X mosaicism and a phenotype suggestive of a severe form of CdLS who presented with growth and mental retardation, multiple congenital anomalies, and facial dysmorphism. Array CGH confirmed mosaic monosomy X and identified a novel deletion of SMC1A spanning multiple exons, suggesting a possible loss-of-function effect. Sequencing of both genomic and cDNA demonstrated an 8,152â€‰bp deletion of genomic DNA from exon 13 to intron 16. Although a loss-of-function effect cannot be excluded, the resulting mRNA remains in-frame and is expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting a dominant-negative effect. We hypothesize that the size of this deletion compared to previously reported mutations may account for this patient's severe CdLS phenotype. The presence of mosaic monosomy X may also modify the phenotype.",journal article; case reports
24169519,20 ans après: a second mutation in MAOA identified by targeted high-throughput sequencing in a family with altered behavior and cognition.,"Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by an extraordinary genetic heterogeneity, with >250 genes that have been implicated in monogenic forms of ID. Because this complexity precluded systematic testing for mutations and because clinical features are often non-specific, for some of these genes only few cases or families have been unambiguously documented. It is the case of the X-linked gene encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), for which only one nonsense mutation has been identified in Brunner syndrome, characterized in a single family by mild non-dysmorphic ID and impulsive, violent and aggressive behaviors. We have performed targeted high-throughput sequencing of 220 genes, including MAOA, in patients with undiagnosed ID. We identified a c.797_798delinsTT (p.C266F) missense mutation in MAOA in a boy with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit and autoaggressive behavior. Two maternal uncles carry the mutation and have severe ID, with a history of maltreatment in early childhood. This novel missense mutation decreases MAOA enzymatic activity, leading to abnormal levels of urinary monoamines. The identification of this new point mutation confirms, for the first time since 1993, the monogenic implication of the MAOA gene in ID of various degrees, autism and behavioral disturbances. The variable expressivity of the mutation observed in male patients of this family may involve gene-environment interactions, and the identification of a perturbation in monoamine metabolism should be taken into account when prescribing psychoactive drugs in such patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
20489057,XIAP deficiency: a unique primary immunodeficiency best classified as X-linked familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and not as X-linked lymphoproliferative disease.,"X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency, caused by BIRC4 mutations, is described to cause X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) phenotypes. However, compared with XLP caused by SLAM-Associated Protein deficiency (SH2D1A mutation), XIAP deficiency was originally observed to be associated with a high incidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and a lack of lymphoma, suggesting that classification of XIAP deficiency as a cause of XLP may not be entirely accurate. To further characterize XIAP deficiency, we reviewed our experience with 10 patients from 8 unrelated families with BIRC4 mutations. Nine of 10 patients developed HLH by 8 years of age. Most patients presented in infancy, and recurrent HLH was common. There were no cases of lymphoma. Lymphocyte defects thought to contribute to HLH development in SLAM-Associated Protein deficiency were not observed in XIAP deficiency. We conclude that XIAP deficiency is a unique primary immunodeficiency that is more appropriately classified as X-linked familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
15833888,NEMO mutations in 2 unrelated boys with severe infections and conical teeth.,"X-linked recessive anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency is a developmental and immunologic disorder caused by mutations in nuclear factor-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), which is essential for nuclear factor-kappaB activation. Early in life, affected boys present a typical appearance, with hypotrichosis or atrichosis, hypohidrosis or anhidrosis, and hypodontia or anodontia with conical incisors. They are also susceptible to various microorganisms, mostly pyogenic bacteria and mycobacteria. Here we report 2 unrelated boys, aged 6 and 11 years, who have novel mutations in NEMO and present conical incisors and hypodontia as their sole and long-unrecognized developmental anomaly. One child had isolated recurrent pneumococcal disease, whereas the other had multiple infections. Our observations indicate that conical incisors should prompt the search for NEMO mutations in boys with unusual infectious diseases.",journal article; case reports
16818673,X-linked susceptibility to mycobacteria is caused by mutations in NEMO impairing CD40-dependent IL-12 production.,"Germline mutations in five autosomal genes involved in interleukin (IL)-12-dependent, interferon (IFN)-gamma-mediated immunity cause Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD). The molecular basis of X-linked recessive (XR)-MSMD remains unknown. We report here mutations in the leucine zipper (LZ) domain of the NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) gene in three unrelated kindreds with XR-MSMD. The mutant proteins were produced in normal amounts in blood and fibroblastic cells. However, the patients' monocytes presented an intrinsic defect in T cell-dependent IL-12 production, resulting in defective IFN-gamma secretion by T cells. IL-12 production was also impaired as the result of a specific defect in NEMO- and NF-kappaB/c-Rel-mediated CD40 signaling after the stimulation of monocytes and dendritic cells by CD40L-expressing T cells and fibroblasts, respectively. However, the CD40-dependent up-regulation of costimulatory molecules of dendritic cells and the proliferation and immunoglobulin class switch of B cells were normal. Moreover, the patients' blood and fibroblastic cells responded to other NF-kappaB activators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, and lipopolysaccharide. These two mutations in the NEMO LZ domain provide the first genetic etiology of XR-MSMD. They also demonstrate the importance of the T cell- and CD40L-triggered, CD40-, and NEMO/NF-kappaB/c-Rel-mediated induction of IL-12 by monocyte-derived cells for protective immunity to mycobacteria in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
16950813,IRAK4 and NEMO mutations in otherwise healthy children with recurrent invasive pneumococcal disease.,"BACKGROUND: About 2% of childhood episodes of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) are recurrent, and most remain unexplained. OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of otherwise healthy, unrelated children with recurrent IPD as the only clinical infectious manifestation of an inherited disorder in nuclear factor-kappaB(NF-kappaB)-dependent immunity. RESULTS: One child carried two germline mutations in IRAK4, and had impaired cellular responses to interleukin (IL)1 receptor and toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. The other child carried a hemizygous mutation in NEMO, associated with a broader impairment of NF-kappaB activation, with an impaired cellular response to IL-1R, TLR and tumour necrosis factor receptor stimulation. The two patients shared a narrow clinical phenotype, associated with two related but different genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Otherwise healthy children with recurrent IPD should be explored for underlying primary immunodeficiencies affecting the IRAK4-dependent and NEMO-dependent signalling pathways.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"

Two highly homologous isoforms of PRS (PRS1 and PRS2), each encoded by a distinct X chromosome-linked locus, have been identified, and PRS1 and 2 cDNAs have been cloned. The entire 954-base pair translated regions of PRS1 and 2 cDNAs derived from cultured lymphoblasts and fibroblasts from two patients in whom purine nucleotide feedback resistance of PRS is associated with enzyme superactivity and neurodevelopmental defects were examined by direct sequencing after polymerase chain reaction amplification of PRS transcripts. Nucleotide sequences of PRS2 cDNAs from the patients and normal individuals were identical. In contrast, PRS1 cDNAs from the patients differ from normal PRS1 cDNA, each by a single base substitution. PRS1 cDNA from patient N. B. showed an A to G transition at nucleotide 341, corresponding to an asparagine to serine change at amino acid residue 113 of mature PRS1. A G to C transversion at nucleotide 547, indicating an aspartic acid to histidine change at amino acid 182, was found for PRS1 cDNA from patient S. M. Point mutations at the sites identified in the PRS1 cDNAs of the two patients were confirmed by the results of RNase mapping analysis. Normal, N. B., and S. M. PRS1 cDNAs were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)/pLyS, and recombinant N. B. and S. M.

One manifested a deletion in exons 10-15 of the CDKL5 gene, another manifested a single base-pair duplication in exon 3, and the rest manifested base-pair exchanges. The mean age of seizure onset was 1.8 months (range, 1-3 months). Although the majority (4/6, 67%) presented with partial-onset seizures, all children developed infantile spasms. All children demonstrated developmental delay and visual impairment. Although such mutations are X-linked, two children were boys. They did not present with more severe phenotypes than their female counterparts. Despite trials of antiepileptic drugs (mean, 5; range, 3-7), steroids/adrenocorticotropic hormone (4/6; 67%), and the ketogenic diet (6/6; 100%), all children manifested refractory seizures at last follow-up.

24721225,X-exome sequencing in Finnish families with intellectual disability--four novel mutations and two novel syndromic phenotypes.,"BACKGROUND: X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a group of genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by substantial impairment in cognitive abilities, social and behavioral adaptive skills. Next generation sequencing technologies have become a powerful approach for identifying molecular gene mutations relevant for diagnosis. METHODS & OBJECTIVES: Enrichment of X-chromosome specific exons and massively parallel sequencing was performed for identifying the causative mutations in 14 Finnish families, each of them having several males affected with intellectual disability of unknown cause. RESULTS: We found four novel mutations in known XLID genes. Two mutations; one previously reported missense mutation (c.1111C > T), and one novel frameshift mutation (c. 990_991insGCTGC) were identified in SLC16A2, a gene that has been linked to Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS). One novel missense mutation (c.1888G > C) was found in GRIA3 and two novel splice donor site mutations (c.357 + 1G > C and c.985 + 1G > C) were identified in the DLG3 gene. One missense mutation (c.1321C > T) was identified in the candidate gene ZMYM3 in three affected males with a previously unrecognized syndrome characterized by unique facial features, aortic stenosis and hypospadia was detected. All of the identified mutations segregated in the corresponding families and were absent in > 100 Finnish controls and in the publicly available databases. In addition, a previously reported benign variant (c.877G > A) in SYP was identified in a large family with nine affected males in three generations, who have a syndromic phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: All of the mutations found in this study are being reported for the first time in Finnish families with several affected male patients whose etiological diagnoses have remained unknown to us, in some families, for more than 30 years. This study illustrates the impact of X-exome sequencing to identify rare gene mutations and the challenges of interpreting the results. Further functional studies are required to confirm the cause of the syndromic phenotypes associated with ZMYM3 and SYP in this study.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
17989220,Mutations in ionotropic AMPA receptor 3 alter channel properties and are associated with moderate cognitive impairment in humans.,"Ionotropic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (iGluRs) mediate the majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the CNS and are essential for the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation and long-term depression, two cellular models of learning and memory. We identified a genomic deletion (0.4 Mb) involving the entire GRIA3 (encoding iGluR3) by using an X-array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and four missense variants (G833R, M706T, R631S, and R450Q) in functional domains of iGluR3 by sequencing 400 males with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Three variants were found in males with moderate MR and were absent in 500 control males. Expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that G833R resulted in a 78% reduction of iGluR3 due to protein misfolding. Whole-cell recording studies of iGluR3 homomers in HEK293 cells revealed that neither iGluR3-M706T (S2 domain) nor iGluR3-R631S (near channel core) had substantial channel function, whereas R450Q (S1 domain) was associated with accelerated receptor desensitization. When forming heteromeric receptors with iGluR2 in HEK293 cells, all four iGluR3 variants had altered desensitization kinetics. Our study provides the genetic and functional evidence that mutant iGluR3 with altered kinetic properties is associated with moderate cognitive impairment in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18455129,Oligosaccharyltransferase-subunit mutations in nonsyndromic mental retardation.,"Mental retardation (MR) is the most frequent handicap among children and young adults. Although a large proportion of X-linked MR genes have been identified, only four genes responsible for autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic MR (AR-NSMR) have been described so far. Here, we report on two genes involved in autosomal-recessive and X-linked NSMR. First, autozygosity mapping in two sibs born to first-cousin French parents led to the identification of a region on 8p22-p23.1. This interval encompasses the gene N33/TUSC3 encoding one subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase) complex, which catalyzes the transfer of an oligosaccharide chain on nascent proteins, the key step of N-glycosylation. Sequencing N33/TUSC3 identified a 1 bp insertion, c.787_788insC, resulting in a premature stop codon, p.N263fsX300, and leading to mRNA decay. Surprisingly, glycosylation analyses of patient fibroblasts showed normal N-glycan synthesis and transfer, suggesting that normal N-glycosylation observed in patient fibroblasts may be due to functional compensation. Subsequently, screening of the X-linked N33/TUSC3 paralog, the IAP gene, identified a missense mutation (c.932T-->G, p.V311G) in a family with X-linked NSMR. Recent studies of fucosylation and polysialic-acid modification of neuronal cell-adhesion glycoproteins have shown the critical role of glycosylation in synaptic plasticity. However, our data provide the first demonstration that a defect in N-glycosylation can result in NSMR. Together, our results demonstrate that fine regulation of OTase activity is essential for normal cognitive-function development, providing therefore further insights to understand the pathophysiological bases of MR.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18760763,C-terminal deletions in the ALAS2 gene lead to gain of function and cause X-linked dominant protoporphyria without anemia or iron overload.,"All reported mutations in ALAS2, which encodes the rate-regulating enzyme of erythroid heme biosynthesis, cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia. We describe eight families with ALAS2 deletions, either c.1706-1709 delAGTG (p.E569GfsX24) or c.1699-1700 delAT (p.M567EfsX2), resulting in frameshifts that lead to replacement or deletion of the 19-20 C-terminal residues of the enzyme. Prokaryotic expression studies show that both mutations markedly increase ALAS2 activity. These gain-of-function mutations cause a previously unrecognized form of porphyria, X-linked dominant protoporphyria, characterized biochemically by a high proportion of zinc-protoporphyrin in erythrocytes, in which a mismatch between protoporphyrin production and the heme requirement of differentiating erythroid cells leads to overproduction of protoporphyrin in amounts sufficient to cause photosensitivity and liver disease.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18955570,Familial pulmonary alveolar proteinosis caused by mutations in CSF2RA.,"Primary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare syndrome characterized by accumulation of surfactant in the lungs that is presumed to be mediated by disruption of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling based on studies in genetically modified mice. The effects of GM-CSF are mediated by heterologous receptors composed of GM-CSF binding (GM-CSF-Ralpha) and nonbinding affinity-enhancing (GM-CSF-Rbeta) subunits. We describe PAP, failure to thrive, and increased GM-CSF levels in two sisters aged 6 and 8 yr with abnormalities of both GM-CSF-Ralpha-encoding alleles (CSF2RA). One was a 1.6-Mb deletion in the pseudoautosomal region of one maternal X chromosome encompassing CSF2RA. The other, a point mutation in the paternal X chromosome allele encoding a G174R substitution, altered an N-linked glycosylation site within the cytokine binding domain and glycosylation of GM-CSF-Ralpha, severely reducing GM-CSF binding, receptor signaling, and GM-CSF-dependent functions in primary myeloid cells. Transfection of cloned cDNAs faithfully reproduced the signaling defect at physiological GM-CSF concentrations. Interestingly, at high GM-CSF concentrations similar to those observed in the index patient, signaling was partially rescued, thereby providing a molecular explanation for the slow progression of disease in these children. These results establish that GM-CSF signaling is critical for surfactant homeostasis in humans and demonstrate that mutations in CSF2RA cause familial PAP.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

19800048,OFD1 is mutated in X-linked Joubert syndrome and interacts with LCA5-encoded lebercilin.,"We ascertained a multi-generation Malaysian family with Joubert syndrome (JS). The presence of asymptomatic obligate carrier females suggested an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. Affected males presented with mental retardation accompanied by postaxial polydactyly and retinitis pigmentosa. Brain MRIs showed the presence of a ""molar tooth sign,"" which classifies this syndrome as classic JS with retinal involvement. Linkage analysis showed linkage to Xpter-Xp22.2 and a maximum LOD score of 2.06 for marker DXS8022. Mutation analysis revealed a frameshift mutation, p.K948NfsX8, in exon 21 of OFD1. In an isolated male with JS, a second frameshift mutation, p.E923KfsX3, in the same exon was identified. OFD1 has previously been associated with oral-facial-digital type 1 (OFD1) syndrome, a male-lethal X-linked dominant condition, and with X-linked recessive Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2 (SGBS2). In a yeast two-hybrid screen of a retinal cDNA library, we identified OFD1 as an interacting partner of the LCA5-encoded ciliary protein lebercilin. We show that X-linked recessive mutations in OFD1 reduce, but do not eliminate, the interaction with lebercilin, whereas X-linked dominant OFD1 mutations completely abolish binding to lebercilin. In addition, recessive mutations in OFD1 did not affect the pericentriolar localization of the recombinant protein in hTERT-RPE1 cells, whereas this localization was lost for dominant mutations. These findings offer a molecular explanation for the phenotypic spectrum observed for OFD1 mutations; this spectrum now includes OFD1 syndrome, SGBS2, and JS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article"

The level of the mutant factor IX protein in plasma was normal, but the clotting activity of factor IX from the proband was approximately eight times the normal level. In vitro, recombinant factor IX-R338L had a specific activity that was 5 to 10 times as high as that in the recombinant wild-type factor IX. The R338 substitution causes a gain-of-function mutation, resulting in factor IX that is hyperfunctional.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
12160730,X-linked recessive atrophic macular degeneration from RPGR mutation.,"We mapped a new X-linked recessive atrophic macular degeneration locus to Xp21.1-p11.4 and show allelic involvement of the gene RPGR, which normally causes severe peripheral retinal degeneration leading to global blindness. Ten affected males whom we examined had primarily macular atrophy causing progressive loss of visual acuity with minimal peripheral visual impairment. One additional male showed extensive macular degeneration plus peripheral loss of retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaries. Full-field electroretinograms (ERGs) showed normal cone and rod responses in some affected males despite advanced macular degeneration, emphasizing the dissociation of atrophic macular degeneration from generalized cone degenerations, including X-linked cone dystrophy (COD1). The RPGR gene nonsense mutation G-->T at open reading frame (ORF)15+1164 cosegregated with the disease and may create a donor splice site. Identification of an RPGR mutation in atrophic maculardegeneration expands the phenotypic range associated with this gene and provides a new tool for the dissection of the relationship between clinically different retinal pathologies.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
22002931,Novel GDI1 mutation in a large family with nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability.,"X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a heterogeneous disorder, and mutations in more than 90 genes have been associated with XLID to date. We report on a large multi-generational German family in which the affected male family members had nonsyndromic intellectual disability, that is, they had neither abnormal body measurements nor any other significant clinical problems. Molecular genetic analysis revealed a frameshift mutation in GDI1 (c.1185_1186delAG; Ser396ProfsX15) that co-segregated with the disease. GDI1 encodes for the GDP-dissociation inhibitor alpha (Î±GDI), a protein involved in the regulation of the activity of Rab GTPases. Only three families with GDI1 mutations have been reported so far. The present family supports the lack of additional phenotypic features in patients with GDI1 mutations, rendering a clinical diagnosis of GDI1-associated XLID impossible. Thus, this family not only broadens the spectrum of GDI1 mutations but also emphasizes the need for parallel testing of all known genes associated with ID in patients with an unspecific phenotype.",journal article; case reports
15185169,Mutations in the DLG3 gene cause nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation.,"We have identified truncating mutations in the human DLG3 (neuroendocrine dlg) gene in 4 of 329 families with moderate to severe X-linked mental retardation. DLG3 encodes synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102), a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family. Neuronal SAP102 is expressed during early brain development and is localized to the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. It is composed of three amino-terminal PDZ domains, an src homology domain, and a carboxyl-terminal guanylate kinase domain. The PDZ domains interact directly with the NR2 subunits of the NMDA glutamate receptor and with other proteins responsible for NMDA receptor localization, immobilization, and signaling. The mutations identified in this study all introduce premature stop codons within or before the third PDZ domain, and it is likely that this impairs the ability of SAP102 to interact with the NMDA receptor and/or other proteins involved in downstream NMDA receptor signaling pathways. NMDA receptors have been implicated in the induction of certain forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression, and these changes in synaptic efficacy have been proposed as neural mechanisms underlying memory and learning. The disruption of NMDA receptor targeting or signaling, as a result of the loss of SAP102, may lead to altered synaptic plasticity and may explain the intellectual impairment observed in individuals with DLG3 mutations.",research-article; journal article
16385466,ZNF674: a new kruppel-associated box-containing zinc-finger gene involved in nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation.,"Array-based comparative genomic hybridization has proven to be successful in the identification of genetic defects in disorders involving mental retardation. Here, we studied a patient with learning disabilities, retinal dystrophy, and short stature. The family history was suggestive of an X-linked contiguous gene syndrome. Hybridization of full-coverage X-chromosomal bacterial artificial chromosome arrays revealed a deletion of ~1 Mb in Xp11.3, which harbors RP2, SLC9A7, CHST7, and two hypothetical zinc-finger genes, ZNF673 and ZNF674. These genes were analyzed in 28 families with nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) that show linkage to Xp11.3; the analysis revealed a nonsense mutation, p.E118X, in the coding sequence of ZNF674 in one family. This mutation is predicted to result in a truncated protein containing the Kruppel-associated box domains but lacking the zinc-finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding. We characterized the complete ZNF674 gene structure and subsequently tested an additional 306 patients with XLMR for mutations by direct sequencing. Two amino acid substitutions, p.T343M and p.P412L, were identified that were not found in unaffected individuals. The proline at position 412 is conserved between species and is predicted by molecular modeling to reduce the DNA-binding properties of ZNF674. The p.T343M transition is probably a polymorphism, because the homologous ZNF674 gene in chimpanzee has a methionine at that position. ZNF674 belongs to a cluster of seven highly related zinc-finger genes in Xp11, two of which (ZNF41 and ZNF81) were implicated previously in XLMR. Identification of ZNF674 as the third XLMR gene in this cluster may indicate a common role for these zinc-finger genes that is crucial to human cognitive functioning.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
21796205,Second messenger role for Mg2+ revealed by human T-cell immunodeficiency.,"The magnesium ion, Mg(2+), is essential for all life as a cofactor for ATP, polyphosphates such as DNA and RNA, and metabolic enzymes, but whether it plays a part in intracellular signalling (as Ca(2+) does) is unknown. Here we identify mutations in the magnesium transporter gene, MAGT1, in a novel X-linked human immunodeficiency characterized by CD4 lymphopenia, severe chronic viral infections, and defective T-lymphocyte activation. We demonstrate that a rapid transient Mg(2+) influx is induced by antigen receptor stimulation in normal T cells and by growth factor stimulation in non-lymphoid cells. MAGT1 deficiency abrogates the Mg(2+) influx, leading to impaired responses to antigen receptor engagement, including defective activation of phospholipase CÎ³1 and a markedly impaired Ca(2+) influx in T cells but not B cells. These observations reveal a role for Mg(2+) as an intracellular second messenger coupling cell-surface receptor activation to intracellular effectors and identify MAGT1 as a possible target for novel therapeutics.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; journal article"
23913813,MLL2 and KDM6A mutations in patients with Kabuki syndrome.,"Kabuki syndrome is a congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, specific facial features including long palpebral fissures and ectropion of the lateral third of the lower eyelids, prominent digit pads, and skeletal and visceral abnormalities. Mutations in MLL2 and KDM6A cause Kabuki syndrome. We screened 81 individuals with Kabuki syndrome for mutations in these genes by conventional methods (n = 58) and/or targeted resequencing (n = 45) or whole exome sequencing (n = 5). We identified a mutation in MLL2 or KDM6A in 50 (61.7%) and 5 (6.2%) cases, respectively. Thirty-five MLL2 mutations and two KDM6A mutations were novel. Non-protein truncating-type MLL2 mutations were mainly located around functional domains, while truncating-type mutations were scattered through the entire coding region. The facial features of patients in the MLL2 truncating-type mutation group were typical based on those of the 10 originally reported patients with Kabuki syndrome; those of the other groups were less typical. High arched eyebrows, short fifth finger, and hypotonia in infancy were more frequent in the MLL2 mutation group than in the KDM6A mutation group. Short stature and postnatal growth retardation were observed in all individuals with KDM6A mutations, but in only half of the group with MLL2 mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

In 2010, MLL2 was identified as a causative gene. On the basis of published reports, 55-80% of KS cases can be explained by MLL2 abnormalities. Recently, de novo deletion of KDM6A has been reported in three KS patients, but point mutations of KDM6A have never been found. In this study, we investigated KDM6A in 32 KS patients without an MLL2 mutation. We identified two nonsense mutations and one 3-bp deletion of KDM6A in three KS cases. This is the first report of KDM6A point mutations associated with KS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

Fluorescence in situ hybridization and whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that the X chromosome breakpoint disrupts KDM6A in the second intron. No genes were directly disrupted on chromosome 5. KDM6A is a histone 3 lysine 27 demethylase and a histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferase. Expression of KDM6A is significantly reduced in DGAP100 lymphoblastoid cells compared to control samples. We identified nine additional cases with neurodevelopmental delay and various other features consistent with the DGAP100 phenotype with copy number variation encompassing KDM6A from microarray databases. We evaluated haploinsufficiency of kdm6a in a zebrafish model. kdm6a is expressed in the pharyngeal arches and ethmoid plate of the developing zebrafish, while a kdm6a morpholino knockdown exhibited craniofacial defects. We conclude KDM6A dosage regulation is associated with severe and diverse structural defects and developmental abnormalities.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27302555,Mutation Update for Kabuki Syndrome Genes KMT2D and KDM6A and Further Delineation of X-Linked Kabuki Syndrome Subtype 2.,"Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare but recognizable condition that consists of a characteristic face, short stature, various organ malformations, and a variable degree of intellectual disability. Mutations in KMT2D have been identified as the main cause for KS, whereas mutations in KDM6A are a much less frequent cause. Here, we report a mutation screening in a case series of 347 unpublished patients, in which we identified 12 novel KDM6A mutations (KS type 2) and 208 mutations in KMT2D (KS type 1), 132 of them novel. Two of the KDM6A mutations were maternally inherited and nine were shown to be de novo. We give an up-to-date overview of all published mutations for the two KS genes and point out possible mutation hot spots and strategies for molecular genetic testing. We also report the clinical details for 11 patients with KS type 2, summarize the published clinical information, specifically with a focus on the less well-defined X-linked KS type 2, and comment on phenotype-genotype correlations as well as sex-specific phenotypic differences. Finally, we also discuss a possible role of KDM6A in Kabuki-like Turner syndrome and report a mutation screening of KDM6C (UTY) in male KS patients.",journal article
22197486,"Deletion of KDM6A, a histone demethylase interacting with MLL2, in three patients with Kabuki syndrome.","Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare genetic disease that causes developmental delay and congenital anomalies. Since the identification of MLL2 mutations as the primary cause of KS, such mutations have been identified in 56%-76% of affected individuals, suggesting that there may be additional genes associated with KS. Here, we describe three KS individuals with de novo partial or complete deletions of an X chromosome gene, KDM6A, that encodes a histone demethylase that interacts with MLL2. Although KDM6A escapes X inactivation, we found a skewed X inactivation pattern, in which the deleted X chromosome was inactivated in the majority of the cells. This study identifies KDM6A mutations as another cause of KS and highlights the growing role of histone methylases and histone demethylases in multiple-congenital-anomaly and intellectual-disability syndromes.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

In these families, genetic linkage analysis was able to locate the disease gene to the distal part of the short arm of the X chromosome, between Xpter and Xp11.4.

22305531,The phenotype of a germline mutation in PIGA: the gene somatically mutated in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.,"Phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) is involved in the first step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis. Many proteins, including CD55 and CD59, are anchored to the cell by GPI. Loss of CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes causes complement-mediated lysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a disease that manifests after clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells with somatic PIGA mutations. Although somatic PIGA mutations have been identified in many PNH patients, it has been proposed that germline mutations are lethal. We report a family with an X-linked lethal disorder involving cleft palate, neonatal seizures, contractures, central nervous system (CNS) structural malformations, and other anomalies. An X chromosome exome next-generation sequencing screen identified a single nonsense PIGA mutation, c.1234C>T, which predicts p.Arg412(∗). This variant segregated with disease and carrier status in the family, is similar to mutations known to cause PNH as a result of PIGA dysfunction, and was absent in 409 controls. PIGA-null mutations are thought to be embryonic lethal, suggesting that p.Arg412(∗) PIGA has residual function. Transfection of a mutant p.Arg412(∗) PIGA construct into PIGA-null cells showed partial restoration of GPI-anchored proteins. The genetic data show that the c.1234C>T (p.Arg412(∗)) mutation is present in an affected child, is linked to the affected chromosome in this family, is rare in the population, and results in reduced, but not absent, biosynthesis of GPI anchors. We conclude that c.1234C>T in PIGA results in the lethal X-linked phenotype recognized in the reported family.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
8599356,Infantile lethal variant of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome associated with hydrops fetalis.,"Simpson-Golabi Behmel syndrome (SGBS) is an X-linked disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal macrosomia, minor facial anomalies, and variable visceral, skeletal, and neurological abnormalities. Since its first description by Simpson et al. [1975: BD:OA XI(2):18-24], a wide clinical range of cases has been reported. There is great variability in severity, ranging from a mild form associated with long-term survival to an early lethal form with multiple congenital anomalies and severe mental retardation. In 8 reported families, affected individuals died in infancy. Here we present 4 maternally related, male cousins with a severe variant of SGBS. One of these males was aborted therapeutically at 19 weeks of gestation following the detection of multicystic kidneys on ultrasound. The 3 liveborn males were hydropic at birth with a combination of craniofacial anomalies including macrocephaly; apparently low-set, posteriorly angulated ears; hypertelorism; short, broad nose with anteverted nares; large mouth with thin upper vermilion border; prominent philtrum; high-arched or cleft palate; short neck; redundant skin; hypoplastic nails; skeletal defects involving upper and lower limbs; gastrointestinal and genitourinary anomalies. All 3 patients were hypotonic and neurologically impaired from birth. With the exception of a trilobate left lung in one patient, the cardiorespiratory system was structurally normal. All patients died within the first 8 weeks of life of multiple complications including pneumonia and sepsis. Two SGBS kindreds, with moderate expression of the condition, have been mapped to Xq27. It is not known whether severe, familial cases, such as ours, are genetically distinct from and map to another locus. Final resolution of the genetic basis of the phenotypic variability in SGBS must await cloning and mutation analysis of the SGBS gene(s).",journal article; case reports
24259288,A novel germline PIGA mutation in Ferro-Cerebro-Cutaneous syndrome: a neurodegenerative X-linked epileptic encephalopathy with systemic iron-overload.,"Three related males presented with a newly recognized x-linked syndrome associated with neurodegeneration, cutaneous abnormalities, and systemic iron overload. Linkage studies demonstrated that they shared a haplotype on Xp21.3-Xp22.2 and exome sequencing was used to identify candidate variants. Of the segregating variants, only a PIGA mutation segregated with disease in the family. The c.328_330delCCT PIGA variant predicts, p.Leu110del (or c.1030_1032delCTT, p.Leu344del depending on the reference sequence). The unaffected great-grandfather shared his X allele with the proband but he did not have the PIGA mutation, indicating that the mutation arose de novo in his daughter. A single family with a germline PIGA mutation has been reported; affected males had a phenotype characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and severe neurologic impairment resulting in infantile lethality. In contrast, affected boys in the family described here were born without anomalies and were neurologically normal prior to onset of seizures after 6 months of age, with two surviving to the second decade. PIGA encodes an enzyme in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway. An affected individual in the family studied here was deficient in GPI anchor proteins on granulocytes but not erythrocytes. In conclusion, the PIGA mutation in this family likely causes a reduction in GPI anchor protein cell surface expression in various cell types, resulting in the observed pleiotropic phenotype involving central nervous system, skin, and iron metabolism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19844254,Familial interstitial Xq27.3q28 duplication encompassing the FMR1 gene but not the MECP2 gene causes a new syndromic mental retardation condition.,"X-linked mental retardation is a common disorder that accounts for 5-10% of cases of mental retardation in males. Fragile X syndrome is the most common form resulting from a loss of expression of the FMR1 gene. On the other hand, partial duplication of the long arm of the X chromosome is uncommon. It leads to functional disomy of the corresponding genes and has been reported in several cases of mental retardation in males. In this study, we report on the clinical and genetic characterization of a new X-linked mental retardation syndrome characterized by short stature, hypogonadism and facial dysmorphism, and show that this syndrome is caused by a small Xq27.3q28 interstitial duplication encompassing the FMR1 gene. This family broadens the phenotypic spectrum of FMR1 anomalies in an unexpected manner, and we suggest that this condition may represent the fragile X syndrome ""contre-type"".","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
22885700,HDAC8 mutations in Cornelia de Lange syndrome affect the cohesin acetylation cycle.,"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a dominantly inherited congenital malformation disorder, caused by mutations in the cohesin-loading protein NIPBL for nearly 60% of individuals with classical CdLS, and by mutations in the core cohesin components SMC1A (~5%) and SMC3 (<1%) for a smaller fraction of probands. In humans, the multisubunit complex cohesin is made up of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21 and a STAG protein. These form a ring structure that is proposed to encircle sister chromatids to mediate sister chromatid cohesion and also has key roles in gene regulation. SMC3 is acetylated during S-phase to establish cohesiveness of chromatin-loaded cohesin, and in yeast, the class I histone deacetylase Hos1 deacetylates SMC3 during anaphase. Here we identify HDAC8 as the vertebrate SMC3 deacetylase, as well as loss-of-function HDAC8 mutations in six CdLS probands. Loss of HDAC8 activity results in increased SMC3 acetylation and inefficient dissolution of the ‘used’ cohesin complex released from chromatin in both prophase and anaphase. SMC3 with retained acetylation is loaded onto chromatin, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis demonstrates decreased occupancy of cohesin localization sites that results in a consistent pattern of altered transcription seen in CdLS cell lines with either NIPBL or HDAC8 mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25470569,Gigantism and acromegaly due to Xq26 microduplications and GPR101 mutation.,"BACKGROUND:Increased secretion of growth hormone leads to gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults; the genetic causes of gigantism and acromegaly are poorly understood. METHODS:We performed clinical and genetic studies of samples obtained from 43 patients with gigantism and then sequenced an implicated gene in samples from 248 patients with acromegaly. RESULTS:We observed microduplication on chromosome Xq26.3 in samples from 13 patients with gigantism; of these samples, 4 were obtained from members of two unrelated kindreds, and 9 were from patients with sporadic cases. All the patients had disease onset during early childhood. Of the patients with gigantism who did not carry an Xq26.3 microduplication, none presented before the age of 5 years. Genomic characterization of the Xq26.3 region suggests that the microduplications are generated during chromosome replication and that they contain four protein-coding genes. Only one of these genes, GPR101, which encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor, was overexpressed in patients' pituitary lesions. We identified a recurrent GPR101 mutation (p.E308D) in 11 of 248 patients with acromegaly, with the mutation found mostly in tumors. When the mutation was transfected into rat GH3 cells, it led to increased release of growth hormone and proliferation of growth hormone-producing cells. CONCLUSIONS:We describe a pediatric disorder (which we have termed X-linked acrogigantism [X-LAG]) that is caused by an Xq26.3 genomic duplication and is characterized by early-onset gigantism resulting from an excess of growth hormone. Duplication of GPR101 probably causes X-LAG. We also found a recurrent mutation in GPR101 in some adults with acromegaly.

32116545,Expanding Clinical Presentations Due to Variations in THOC2 mRNA Nuclear Export Factor.,"Multiple TREX mRNA export complex subunits (e.g., THOC1, THOC2, THOC5, THOC6, THOC7) have now been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), neurodegeneration and cancer. We previously implicated missense and splicing-defective THOC2 variants in NDDs and a broad range of other clinical features. Here we report 10 individuals from nine families with rare missense THOC2 variants including the first case of a recurrent variant (p.Arg77Cys), and an additional individual with an intragenic THOC2 microdeletion (Del-Ex37-38). Ex vivo missense variant testing and patient-derived cell line data from current and published studies show 9 of the 14 missense THOC2 variants result in reduced protein stability. The splicing-defective and deletion variants result in a loss of small regions of the C-terminal THOC2 RNA binding domain (RBD). Interestingly, reduced stability of THOC2 variant proteins has a flow-on effect on the stability of the multi-protein TREX complex; specifically on the other NDD-associated THOC subunits. Our current, expanded cohort refines the core phenotype of THOC2 NDDs to language disorder and/or ID, with a variable severity, and disorders of growth. A subset of affected individuals' has severe-profound ID, persistent hypotonia and respiratory abnormalities. Further investigations to elucidate the pathophysiological basis for this severe phenotype are warranted.",research-article; journal article
26166480,THOC2 Mutations Implicate mRNA-Export Pathway in X-Linked Intellectual Disability.,"Export of mRNA from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm is essential for protein synthesis, a process vital to all living eukaryotic cells. mRNA export is highly conserved and ubiquitous. Mutations affecting mRNA and mRNA processing or export factors, which cause aberrant retention of mRNAs in the nucleus, are thus emerging as contributors to an important class of human genetic disorders. Here, we report that variants in THOC2, which encodes a subunit of the highly conserved TREX mRNA-export complex, cause syndromic intellectual disability (ID). Affected individuals presented with variable degrees of ID and commonly observed features included speech delay, elevated BMI, short stature, seizure disorders, gait disturbance, and tremors. X chromosome exome sequencing revealed four missense variants in THOC2 in four families, including family MRX12, first ascertained in 1971. We show that two variants lead to decreased stability of THOC2 and its TREX-complex partners in cells derived from the affected individuals. Protein structural modeling showed that the altered amino acids are located in the RNA-binding domains of two complex THOC2 structures, potentially representing two different intermediate RNA-binding states of THOC2 during RNA transport. Our results show that disturbance of the canonical molecular pathway of mRNA export is compatible with life but results in altered neuronal development with other comorbidities.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
26637982,"TAF1 Variants Are Associated with Dysmorphic Features, Intellectual Disability, and Neurological Manifestations.","We describe an X-linked genetic syndrome associated with mutations in TAF1 and manifesting with global developmental delay, intellectual disability (ID), characteristic facial dysmorphology, generalized hypotonia, and variable neurologic features, all in male individuals. Simultaneous studies using diverse strategies led to the identification of nine families with overlapping clinical presentations and affected by de novo or maternally inherited single-nucleotide changes. Two additional families harboring large duplications involving TAF1 were also found to share phenotypic overlap with the probands harboring single-nucleotide changes, but they also demonstrated a severe neurodegeneration phenotype. Functional analysis with RNA-seq for one of the families suggested that the phenotype is associated with downregulation of a set of genes notably enriched with genes regulated by E-box proteins. In addition, knockdown and mutant studies of this gene in zebrafish have shown a quantifiable, albeit small, effect on a neuronal phenotype. Our results suggest that mutations in TAF1 play a critical role in the development of this X-linked ID syndrome.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

This observation has been supported by studies of NONO-deficient mice showing that NONO has an important role in regulating inhibitory synaptic activity. Thus far, the phenotypic spectrum of affected patients remains limited. We applied whole exome sequencing to members of a family in which the proband was presented with a complex phenotype consisting of developmental delay, dysmorphism, and non-compaction cardiomyopathy. Exome analysis identified a novel de novo splice-site variant c.1171+1G>T in exon 11 of NONO gene that is suspected to abolish the donor splicing site. Thus, we propose that the phenotypic spectrum of NONO-related disorder is much broader than described and that pathogenic variants in NONO cause a recognizable phenotype.",brief-report; journal article
27550220,Congenital heart defects and left ventricular non-compaction in males with loss-of-function variants in NONO.,"The non-POU domain containing octamer-binding gene (NONO) is located on chromosome Xq13.1 and encodes a member of a small family of RNA-binding and DNA-binding proteins that perform a variety of tasks involved in RNA synthesis, transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. Loss-of-function variants in NONO have been described as a cause of intellectual disability in males but have not been described in association with congenital heart defects or cardiomyopathy. In this article, we seek to further define the phenotypic consequences of NONO depletion in human subjects.We searched a clinical database of over 6000 individuals referred for exome sequencing and over 60â€…000 individuals referred for CNV analysis.We identified two males with atrial and ventricular septal defects, left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), developmental delay and intellectual disability, who harboured de novo, loss-of-function variants in NONO. We also identified a male infant with developmental delay, congenital brain anomalies and severe LVNC requiring cardiac transplantation, who inherited a single-gene deletion of NONO from his asymptomatic mother.We conclude that in addition to global developmental delay and intellectual disability, males with loss-of-function variants in NONO may also be predisposed to developing congenital heart defects and LVNC with the penetrance of these cardiac-related problems being influenced by genetic, epigenetic, environmental or stochastic factors. Brain imaging of males with NONO deficiency may reveal structural defects with abnormalities of the corpus callosum being the most common. Although dysmorphic features vary between affected individuals, relative macrocephaly is a common feature.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26833328,De Novo Loss-of-Function Mutations in USP9X Cause a Female-Specific Recognizable Syndrome with Developmental Delay and Congenital Malformations.,"Mutations in more than a hundred genes have been reported to cause X-linked recessive intellectual disability (ID) mainly in males. In contrast, the number of identified X-linked genes in which de novo mutations specifically cause ID in females is limited. Here, we report 17 females with de novo loss-of-function mutations in USP9X, encoding a highly conserved deubiquitinating enzyme. The females in our study have a specific phenotype that includes ID/developmental delay (DD), characteristic facial features, short stature, and distinct congenital malformations comprising choanal atresia, anal abnormalities, post-axial polydactyly, heart defects, hypomastia, cleft palate/bifid uvula, progressive scoliosis, and structural brain abnormalities. Four females from our cohort were identified by targeted genetic testing because their phenotype was suggestive for USP9X mutations. In several females, pigment changes along Blaschko lines and body asymmetry were observed, which is probably related to differential (escape from) X-inactivation between tissues. Expression studies on both mRNA and protein level in affected-female-derived fibroblasts showed significant reduction of USP9X level, confirming the loss-of-function effect of the identified mutations. Given that some features of affected females are also reported in known ciliopathy syndromes, we examined the role of USP9X in the primary cilium and found that endogenous USP9X localizes along the length of the ciliary axoneme, indicating that its loss of function could indeed disrupt cilium-regulated processes. Absence of dysregulated ciliary parameters in affected female-derived fibroblasts, however, points toward spatiotemporal specificity of ciliary USP9X (dys-)function.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

METHODS:To uncover the molecular cause of this possibly X-linked disease, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from two members of the index family and targeted gene analysis of other members of this family and of six additional families with affected male fetuses. We also evaluated a series of women with idiopathic polyhydramnios who were pregnant with male fetuses. We performed immunohistochemical analysis, knockdown and overexpression experiments, and protein-protein interaction studies. RESULTS:We identified a mutation in MAGED2 in each of the 13 infants in our analysis who had transient antenatal Bartter's syndrome. MAGED2 encodes melanoma-associated antigen D2 (MAGE-D2) and maps to the X chromosome. We also identified two different MAGED2 mutations in two families with idiopathic polyhydramnios. Four patients died perinatally, and 11 survived. The initial presentation was more severe than in known types of antenatal Bartter's syndrome, as reflected by an earlier onset of polyhydramnios and labor. All symptoms disappeared spontaneously during follow-up in the infants who survived. We showed that MAGE-D2 affects the expression and function of the sodium chloride cotransporters NKCC2 and NCC (key components of salt reabsorption in the distal renal tubule), possibly through adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP signaling and a cytoplasmic heat-shock protein. CONCLUSIONS:We found that MAGED2 mutations caused X-linked polyhydramnios with prematurity and a severe but transient form of antenatal Bartter's syndrome. MAGE-D2 is essential for fetal renal salt reabsorption, amniotic fluid homeostasis, and the maintenance of pregnancy.

27811305,"AMMECR1: a single point mutation causes developmental delay, midface hypoplasia and elliptocytosis.","Deletions in the Xq22.3-Xq23 region, inclusive of COL4A5, have been associated with a contiguous gene deletion syndrome characterised by Alport syndrome with intellectual disability (Mental retardation), Midface hypoplasia and Elliptocytosis (AMME). The extrarenal biological and clinical significance of neighbouring genes to the Alport locus has been largely speculative. We sought to discover a genetic cause for two half-brothers presenting with nephrocalcinosis, early speech and language delay and midface hypoplasia with submucous cleft palate and bifid uvula.Whole exome sequencing was undertaken on maternal half-siblings. In-house genomic analysis included extraction of all shared variants on the X chromosome in keeping with X-linked inheritance. Patient-specific mutants were transfected into three cell lines and microscopically visualised to assess the nuclear expression pattern of the mutant protein.In the affected half-brothers, we identified a hemizygous novel non-synonymous variant of unknown significance in AMMECR1 (c.G530A; p.G177D), a gene residing in the AMME disease locus. Transfected cell lines with the p.G177D mutation showed aberrant nuclear localisation patterns when compared with the wild type. Blood films revealed the presence of elliptocytes in the older brother.Our study shows that a single missense mutation in AMMECR1 causes a phenotype of midface hypoplasia, mild intellectual disability and the presence of elliptocytes, previously reported as part of a contiguous gene deletion syndrome. Functional analysis confirms mutant-specific protein dysfunction. We conclude that AMMECR1 is a critical gene in the pathogenesis of AMME, causing midface hypoplasia and elliptocytosis and contributing to early speech and language delay, infantile hypotonia and hearing loss, and may play a role in dysmorphism, nephrocalcinosis and submucous cleft palate.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
27829781,X-linked heterozygous mutations in ARR3 cause female-limited early onset high myopia.,"To identify genetic mutations in three families with early onset high myopia (eoHM) limited to female members.Genomic DNA was collected from participating members of families XF1, XF2, and XF3. Genome-wide linkage scans were performed on the largest family (XF1). Whole exome sequencing was performed on seven samples, including five samples (four affected and one unaffected) from family XF1, as well as the two probands from family XF2 and XF3. Variants were analyzed with multistep bioinformatics analyses. Sanger-dideoxy sequencing was used to verify candidate variations in families and controls.The genome-wide linkage scans performed on family XF1 detected a candidate locus on chromosome Xp11.1-Xq13.3 with a maximum logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 2.48 and 3.01 for markers DXS991 and DXS986, respectively. Parallel whole exome sequencing identified a novel c.893C>A (p.Ala298Asp) mutation in ARR3 located on Xq13.1 in family XF1, which was shared by all four affected individuals but not the unaffected individual. Two other novel mutations in ARR3, c.298C>T (p.Arg100*) and c.239T>C (p.Leu80Pro), were detected in families XF2 and XF3, respectively. These mutations were predicted to be damaging and were not present in the normal controls and existing databases. All three mutations cosegregated with eoHM in each of the three families, in which all heterozygous female members are affected whereas all hemizygous male family members are not affected. Transmission of the mutations and eoHM in the three families demonstrates an unusual pattern of X-linked female-limited inheritance.These data suggest that heterozygous mutations in ARR3 might be responsible for X-linked female-limited eoHM in the three families, a pattern contrary to the standard X-linked recessive trait. To our knowledge, eoHM is the first human disease associated with mutations in ARR3 and the second X-linked female-limited disease identified thus far. Identification of ARR3 associated with X-linked female-limited trait provides not only additional evidence of this unusual hereditary pattern but also an additional model for investigating the molecular mechanism responsible for female-limited phenotypes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31036665,Mutations in MAGT1 lead to a glycosylation disorder with a variable phenotype.,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare metabolic diseases, due to impaired protein and lipid glycosylation. We identified two patients with defective serum transferrin glycosylation and mutations in the MAGT1 gene. These patients present with a phenotype that is mainly characterized by intellectual and developmental disability. MAGT1 has been described to be a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and more specifically of the STT3B complex. However, it was also claimed that MAGT1 is a magnesium (Mg2+) transporter. So far, patients with mutations in MAGT1 were linked to a primary immunodeficiency, characterized by chronic EBV infections attributed to a Mg2+ homeostasis defect (XMEN). We compared the clinical and cellular phenotype of our two patients to that of an XMEN patient that we recently identified. All three patients have an N-glycosylation defect, as was shown by the study of different substrates, such as GLUT1 and SHBG, demonstrating that the posttranslational glycosylation carried out by the STT3B complex is dysfunctional in all three patients. Moreover, MAGT1 deficiency is associated with an enhanced expression of TUSC3, the homolog protein of MAGT1, pointing toward a compensatory mechanism. Hence, we delineate MAGT1-CDG as a disorder associated with two different clinical phenotypes caused by defects in glycosylation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27603907,Mutations in TBL1X Are Associated With Central Hypothyroidism.,"CONTEXT:Isolated congenital central hypothyroidism (CeH) can result from mutations in TRHR, TSHB, and IGSF1, but its etiology often remains unexplained. We identified a missense mutation in the transducin β-like protein 1, X-linked (TBL1X) gene in three relatives diagnosed with isolated CeH. TBL1X is part of the thyroid hormone receptor-corepressor complex. OBJECTIVE:The objectives of the study were the identification of TBL1X mutations in patients with unexplained isolated CeH, Sanger sequencing of relatives of affected individuals, and clinical and biochemical characterization; in vitro investigation of functional consequences of mutations; and mRNA expression in, and immunostaining of, human hypothalami and pituitary glands. DESIGN:This was an observational study. SETTING:The study was conducted at university medical centers. PATIENTS:Nineteen individuals with and seven without a mutation participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Outcome measures included sequencing results, clinical and biochemical characteristics of mutation carriers, and results of in vitro functional and expression studies. RESULTS:Sanger sequencing yielded five additional mutations. All patients (n = 8; six males) were previously diagnosed with CeH (free T4 [FT4] concentration below the reference interval, normal thyrotropin). Eleven relatives (two males) also carried mutations. One female had CeH, whereas 10 others had low-normal FT4 concentrations. As a group, adult mutation carriers had 20%-25% lower FT4 concentrations than controls. Twelve of 19 evaluated carriers had hearing loss. Mutations are located in the highly conserved WD40-repeat domain of the protein, influencing its expression and thermal stability. TBL1X mRNA and protein are expressed in the human hypothalamus and pituitary. CONCLUSIONS:TBL1X mutations are associated with CeH and hearing loss. FT4 concentrations in mutation carriers vary from low-normal to values compatible with CeH.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; observational study"
30061370,Mutations in IRS4 are associated with central hypothyroidism.,"BACKGROUND:Four genetic causes of isolated congenital central hypothyroidism (CeH) have been identified, but many cases remain unexplained. We hypothesised the existence of other genetic causes of CeH with a Mendelian inheritance pattern. METHODS:We performed exome sequencing in two families with unexplained isolated CeH and subsequently Sanger sequenced unrelated idiopathic CeH cases. We performed clinical and biochemical characterisation of the probands and carriers identified by family screening. We investigated IRS4 mRNA expression in human hypothalamus and pituitary tissue, and measured serum thyroid hormones and Trh and Tshb mRNA expression in hypothalamus and pituitary tissue of Irs4 knockout mice. RESULTS:We found mutations in the insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) gene in two pairs of brothers with CeH (one nonsense, one frameshift). Sequencing of IRS4 in 12 unrelated CeH cases negative for variants in known genes yielded three frameshift mutations (two novel) in three patients and one male sibling. All male carriers (n=8) had CeH with plasma free thyroxine concentrations below the reference interval. MRI of the hypothalamus and pituitary showed no structural abnormalities (n=12). 24-hour thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion profiles in two adult male patients showed decreased basal, pulsatile and total TSH secretion. IRS4 mRNA was expressed in human hypothalamic nuclei, including the paraventricular nucleus, and in the pituitary gland. Female knockout mice showed decreased pituitary Tshb mRNA levels but had unchanged serum thyroid hormone concentrations. CONCLUSIONS:Mutations in IRS4 are associated with isolated CeH in male carriers. As IRS4 is involved in leptin signalling, the phenotype may be related to disrupted leptin signalling.",abstract
31587868,Missense Mutations in NKAP Cause a Disorder of Transcriptional Regulation Characterized by Marfanoid Habitus and Cognitive Impairment.,"NKAP is a ubiquitously expressed nucleoplasmic protein that is currently known as a transcriptional regulatory molecule via its interaction with HDAC3 and spliceosomal proteins. Here, we report a disorder of transcriptional regulation due to missense mutations in the X chromosome gene, NKAP. These mutations are clustered in the C-terminal region of NKAP where NKAP interacts with HDAC3 and post-catalytic spliceosomal complex proteins. Consistent with a role for the C-terminal region of NKAP in embryogenesis, nkap mutant zebrafish with a C-terminally truncated NKAP demonstrate severe developmental defects. The clinical features of affected individuals are highly conserved and include developmental delay, hypotonia, joint contractures, behavioral abnormalities, Marfanoid habitus, and scoliosis. In affected cases, transcriptome analysis revealed the presence of a unique transcriptome signature, which is characterized by the downregulation of long genes with higher exon numbers. These observations indicate the critical role of NKAP in transcriptional regulation and demonstrate that perturbations of the C-terminal region lead to developmental defects in both humans and zebrafish.",brief-report; journal article
31206972,Deleterious de novo variants of X-linked ZC4H2 in females cause a variable phenotype with neurogenic arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.,"Pathogenic variants in the X-linked gene ZC4H2, which encodes a zinc-finger protein, cause an infrequently described syndromic form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) with central and peripheral nervous system involvement. We present genetic and detailed phenotypic information on 23 newly identified families and simplex cases that include 19 affected females from 18 families and 14 affected males from nine families. Of note, the 15 females with deleterious de novo ZC4H2 variants presented with phenotypes ranging from mild to severe, and their clinical features overlapped with those seen in affected males. By contrast, of the nine carrier females with inherited ZC4H2 missense variants that were deleterious in affected male relatives, four were symptomatic. We also compared clinical phenotypes with previously published cases of both sexes and provide an overview on 48 males and 57 females from 42 families. The spectrum of ZC4H2 defects comprises novel and recurrent mostly inherited missense variants in affected males, and de novo splicing, frameshift, nonsense, and partial ZC4H2 deletions in affected females. Pathogenicity of two newly identified missense variants was further supported by studies in zebrafish. We propose ZC4H2 as a good candidate for early genetic testing of males and females with a clinical suspicion of fetal hypo-/akinesia and/or (neurogenic) AMC.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29127204,Mutations in the X-linked ATP6AP2 cause a glycosylation disorder with autophagic defects.,"The biogenesis of the multi-subunit vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum with the assembly of the proton pore V0, which is controlled by a group of assembly factors. Here, we identify two hemizygous missense mutations in the extracellular domain of the accessory V-ATPase subunit ATP6AP2 (also known as the [pro]renin receptor) responsible for a glycosylation disorder with liver disease, immunodeficiency, cutis laxa, and psychomotor impairment. We show that ATP6AP2 deficiency in the mouse liver caused hypoglycosylation of serum proteins and autophagy defects. The introduction of one of the missense mutations into Drosophila led to reduced survival and altered lipid metabolism. We further demonstrate that in the liver-like fat body, the autophagic dysregulation was associated with defects in lysosomal acidification and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Finally, both ATP6AP2 mutations impaired protein stability and the interaction with ATP6AP1, a member of the V0 assembly complex. Collectively, our data suggest that the missense mutations in ATP6AP2 lead to impaired V-ATPase assembly and subsequent defects in glycosylation and autophagy.",research-article; journal article
26124059,Lipiduria--with special relevance to Fabry disease.,"Examination of the urine under the microscope using polarised light is invaluable for detecting and identifying lipid particles. Attention to the shape of these Maltese cross bearing bodies can distinguish conventional fat particles from Fabry bodies with great sensitivity and specificity across a wide phenotypic spectrum. This could be a cheap and rapid tool for screening subjects suspected of having Fabry disease for renal involvement. It remains to be seen whether there is value in integrating polarised light into automated urine microscopy machines, but potentially this could greatly help the pathologist or nephrologist in identifying unusual urinary particles, and broaden the capacity for larger scale screening.",review; journal article
28593486,Urinary mulberry cells and mulberry bodies are useful tool to detect late-onset Fabry disease.,"Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a lack of α-galactosidase A activity, which leads to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in various organs. A complete lack of α-galactosidase A activity in a hemizygous male is the classical phenotype, and some hemizygous males show primarily cardiac and/or renal symptoms that appear in adulthood; this is called the variant type or the late-onset type. The kidney and heart are the major target organs, with damage to these organs related to mortality. Thus, in Fabry patients, early detection and early treatment are critical to longevity. Here, we present a 55-year-old Japanese male patient who was diagnosed with late-onset Fabry nephropathy with cardiomyopathy but with no abnormal urinary findings except for urinary mulberry cells and mulberry bodies. In spite of the absence of abnormal urinary findings, the light microscopic and electron microscopic pathological findings showed extensive deposition of globotriaosylceramide to podocytes. In this paper, we propose that the presence of mulberry cells and mulberry bodies can be used for the earlier detection of Fabry nephropathy, especially the late-onset type.",journal article; case-report
8498830,"X-linked ataxia, weakness, deafness, and loss of vision in early childhood with a fatal course.","An X-linked recessive disease with, in almost all patients, a fatal course in early childhood, occurring in a five-generation family is described. The 12 affected boys had early-onset floppiness, ataxia, liability to infections especially of the upper respiratory tract, deafness, and later, a flaccid tetraplegia and areflexia. Eleven boys died before the age of 5 years. One boy is still alive at the age of 12 years, but in addition to the above-mentioned signs, he must be ventilated at night and is nearly blind due to optic atrophy. In the only patient whose central nervous system could be examined at the time of autopsy, an almost complete absence of myelin in the posterior columns of the spinal cord was found. This may be the main pathological substrate for the neurological findings. No biochemical or immunological defects were detected. The family also counted 16 healthy male siblings and 13 definite of 28 possible female carriers. Some carriers developed a hearing impairment in early adulthood. As far as is known now, this disease has not been described before.",journal article; case reports
19414485,X-linked cataract and Nance-Horan syndrome are allelic disorders.,"Nance-Horan syndrome (NHS) is an X-linked developmental disorder characterized by congenital cataract, dental anomalies, facial dysmorphism and, in some cases, mental retardation. Protein truncation mutations in a novel gene (NHS) have been identified in patients with this syndrome. We previously mapped X-linked congenital cataract (CXN) in one family to an interval on chromosome Xp22.13 which encompasses the NHS locus; however, no mutations were identified in the NHS gene. In this study, we show that NHS and X-linked cataract are allelic diseases. Two CXN families, which were negative for mutations in the NHS gene, were further analysed using array comparative genomic hybridization. CXN was found to be caused by novel copy number variations: a complex duplication-triplication re-arrangement and an intragenic deletion, predicted to result in altered transcriptional regulation of the NHS gene. Furthermore, we also describe the clinical and molecular analysis of seven families diagnosed with NHS, identifying four novel protein truncation mutations and a novel large deletion encompassing the majority of the NHS gene, all leading to no functional protein. We therefore show that different mechanisms, aberrant transcription of the NHS gene or no functional NHS protein, lead to different diseases. Our data highlight the importance of copy number variation and non-recurrent re-arrangements leading to different severity of disease and describe the potential mechanisms involved.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
29042737,Nance-Horan Syndrome: A Rare Case Report.,"Dentofacial anomalies may guide us to the diagnosis of many congenital and hereditary syndromes. A 9-year-old boy was diagnosed with Nance-Horan syndrome. This syndrome is an extremely rare X-linked genetic disorder which is entirely expressed in males with semi-dominant transmission which results from mutations occurring in male gametes. It is characterized by facial dysmorphism such as long face, prominent nose and mandibular prognathism, ocular abnormalities such as congenital cataract, microcornea, microphthalmia and strabismus, and dental anomalies including mulberry molars and screwdriver-shaped incisors. Heterozygous females inherit this disease and also suffer from this syndrome but in a milder form. Approximately one-third of the affected males show signs of developmental delay and intellectual abnormalities. This syndrome is very rare and the incidence of the disease has not been established so far. The present article describes the clinical and radiological features and the genetic implications of this syndrome.",case reports; case-report
15914600,Identification of novel RPGR ORF15 mutations in X-linked progressive cone-rod dystrophy (XLCORD) families.,"PURPOSE: To test the incidence of mutations in RPGR ORF15 in six families with X-linked progressive retinal degeneration (cone-rod dystrophy [XLCORD], macular or cone dystrophy) and to undertake a detailed phenotypic assessment of families in whom ORF15 mutations were identified. METHODS: To amplify and sequence ORF15 in its entirety, a cloning strategy was developed. Families with mutations in ORF15 underwent electrophysiological testing, color vision assessment, color fundus photography, and fundus autofluorescence (AF) imaging. RESULTS: Novel protein truncation mutations were identified in two families. In family A, a 2-bp mutation was identified in ORF15+A1094C G1095T, predicted to result in a truncated protein (E364D/E365X). In family B, a G-to-T transversion (ORF15+1176G>T) resulted in a nonsense mutation (G392X). Characteristics of phenotype in both families included progressive deterioration of central vision and subsequently night vision, mild photophobia, and moderate to high myopia. Ophthalmoscopic abnormalities were generally confined to the macula. A parafoveal ring of increased AF was observed, and electrophysiological evidence of a greater generalized abnormality in cone than rod responses were consistent with a cone-rod dystrophy phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The cloning strategy for ORF15 facilitated comprehensive sequence analysis in patients. Two families were identified with nonsense mutations, and clinical evaluation revealed them both to have a similar phenotype. The presence of a parafoveal ring of increased AF was an early indicator of affected status in these families. No disease-causing mutations in ORF15 were detected in four other families, suggesting that ORF15 mutations may not be the most common cause of XLCORD.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20021999,"Loss-of-function mutations in the PRPS1 gene cause a type of nonsyndromic X-linked sensorineural deafness, DFN2.","We report a large Chinese family with X-linked postlingual nonsyndromic hearing impairment in which the critical linkage interval spans a genetic distance of 5.41 cM and a physical distance of 15.1 Mb that overlaps the DFN2 locus. Mutation screening of the PRPS1 gene in this family and in the three previously reported DFN2 families identified four different missense mutations in PRPS1. These mutations result in a loss of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase 1 activity, as was shown in silico by structural analysis and was shown in vitro by enzymatic activity assays in erythrocytes and fibroblasts from patients. By in situ hybridization, we demonstrate expression of Prps1 in murine vestibular and cochlea hair cells, with continuous expression in hair cells and postnatal expression in the spiral ganglion. Being the second identified gene associated with X-linked nonsyndromic deafness, PRPS1 will be a good candidate gene for genetic testing for X-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss.",research-article; journal article
8457509,X linked exudative vitreoretinopathy: clinical features and genetic linkage analysis.,"A four generation family in which familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is inherited as an X linked condition is described. Essentially the condition is one of abnormal vascularisation and signs at birth are those of a retinopathy superficially resembling retinopathy of prematurity, retinal folds, or, in advanced cases, enophthalmos or even phthisis. Prognosis depends on the progression of the retinal changes. The family members, including seven affected males and five obligate carrier females, have been types for 20 DNA markers, and linkage analysis suggests a gene locus either at Xq21.3 or at Xp11. As the latter region includes the locus for the gene for Norrie disease, it is possible that this and X linked vitreoretinopathy are allelic. We can further speculate that the differences in severity of the clinical manifestations are dependent only upon the timing of the insult.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
20159112,Mutations in TSPAN12 cause autosomal-dominant familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.,"Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is an inherited blinding disorder of the retinal vascular system. Although mutations in three genes (LRP5, FZD4, and NDP) are known to cause FEVR, these account for only a fraction of FEVR cases. The proteins encoded by these FEVR genes form part of a signaling complex that activates the Norrin-beta-catenin signaling pathway. Recently, through a large-scale reverse genetic screen in mice, Junge and colleagues identified an additional member of this signaling complex, Tspan12. Here, we report that mutations in TSPAN12 also cause autosomal-dominant FEVR. We describe seven mutations identified in a cohort of 70 FEVR patients in whom we had already excluded the known FEVR genes. This study provides further evidence for the importance of the Norrin-beta-catenin signaling pathway in the development of the retinal vasculature and also indicates that more FEVR genes remain to be identified.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

The differential diagnosis includes retinopathy of prematurity, primary hyperplastic primary vitreous, Coats' disease, peripheral uveitis, retinoblastoma, and Norrie's disease, but this differentiation can usually be made on the basis of clinical findings alone.

To date, 20 distinct mutations have been reported, but little phenotypic data are available on patients with molecularly confirmed AAS. In the present study, we report on our experience of screening for mutations in the FGD1 gene in a cohort of 60 European patients with a clinically suspected diagnosis of AAS. We identified nine novel mutations in 11 patients (detection rate of 18.33%), including three missense mutations (p.R402Q; p.S558W; p.K748E), four truncating mutations (p.Y530X; p.R656X; c.806delC; c.1620delC), one in-frame deletion (c.2020_2022delGAG) and the first reported splice site mutation (c.1935+3A>C). A recurrent mutation (p.R656X) was detected in three independent families.

14681828,Identification and functional analysis of ZIC3 mutations in heterotaxy and related congenital heart defects.,"Mutations in the zinc finger transcription factor ZIC3 cause X-linked heterotaxy and have also been identified in patients with isolated congenital heart disease (CHD). To determine the relative contribution of ZIC3 mutations to both heterotaxy and isolated CHD, we screened the coding region of ZIC3 in 194 unrelated patients, including 61 patients with classic heterotaxy, 93 patients with heart defects characteristic of heterotaxy, and 11 patients with situs inversus totalis. Five novel ZIC3 mutations in three classic heterotaxy kindreds and two sporadic CHD cases were identified. None of these alleles was found in 97 ethnically matched control samples. On the basis of these analyses, we conclude that the phenotypic spectrum of ZIC3 mutations should be expanded to include affected females and CHD not typical for heterotaxy. This screening of a cohort of patients with sporadic heterotaxy indicates that ZIC3 mutations account for approximately 1% of affected individuals. Missense and nonsense mutations were found in the highly conserved zinc finger-binding domain and in the N-terminal protein domain. Functional analysis of all currently known ZIC3 point mutations indicates that mutations in the putative zinc finger DNA binding domain and in the N-terminal domain result in loss of reporter gene transactivation. It is surprising that transfection studies demonstrate aberrant cytoplasmic localization resulting from mutations between amino acids 253-323 of the ZIC3 protein, indicating that the pathogenesis of a subset of ZIC3 mutations results at least in part from failure of appropriate nuclear localization. These results further expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of ZIC3 mutations and provide initial mechanistic insight into their functional consequences.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

Soon after delineation, SPG1 was incorporated into the spectrum of MASA syndrome. HSAS and MASA syndrome show great clinical overlap; DNA linkage analysis places the loci at Xq28. In an increasing number of families with MASA syndrome or HSAS, mutations in L1CAM, a gene located at Xq28, have been reported. In order to further delineate the clinical spectrum, we studied 6 families with male patients presenting with MASA syndrome, HSAS, or a mixed phenotype. We summarized data from previous reports and compared them with our data. Clinical variability appears to be great, even within families. Problems in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis, the possible overlap with X-linked corpus callosum agenesis and FG syndrome, and the different forms of X-linked complicated spastic paraplegia are discussed. Since adducted thumbs and spastic paraplegia are found in 90% of the patients, the condition may be present in males with nonspecific mental retardation.

CHILD syndrome shares some manifestations with X-linked dominant Conradi-HÃ¼nermann syndrome (CDPX2), although the skeletal defects and skin lesions in CDPX2 are bilateral and asymmetric. Because CDPX2 patients have abnormal 8-dehydrosterol metabolism caused by mutations in 3beta-hydroxysteroid-delta8,delta7-isomerase, we measured plasma sterols in a patient with CHILD syndrome and found levels of 8-dehydrocholesterol and 8(9)-cholestenol increased to the same degree as in CDPX2 patients. Subsequently, we identified a nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the patient's 3beta-hydroxysteroid-delta8,delta7-isomerase gene.

All are associated with major developmental malformations that are unusual for metabolic disorders. The existence of mouse models for five of these disorders is beginning to enable more detailed developmental and in vitro studies examining the mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis. In this review, an overview of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway will be presented. Clinical features of the human disorders and mouse models of post-squalene cholesterol biosynthesis will then be discussed.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
9255191,Clinical spectrum of X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome.,"We report the clinical and immunologic features and outcome in 56 patients with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome, a disorder caused by mutations in the CD40 ligand gene. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections (the latter frequently caused by Pneumocystis carinii), chronic diarrhea, and liver involvement (both often associated with Cryptosporidium infection) were common. Many patients had chronic neutropenia associated with oral and rectal ulcers. The marked prevalence of infections caused by intracellular pathogens suggests some degree of impairment of cell-mediated immunity. Although lymphocyte counts and in vitro proliferation to mitogens were normal, a defective in vitro proliferative response to antigens was observed in some patients, and additional defects of cell-mediated immunity may be presumed on the basis of current knowledge of CD40-ligand function. All patients received regular infusions of immunoglobulins. Four patients underwent liver transplantation because of sclerosing cholangitis, which relapsed in there. Three patients underwent bone marrow transplantation. Thirteen patients (23%) died of infection and/or liver disease. X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome, once considered a clinical variant of hypogammaglobulinemia, is a severe immunodeficiency with significant cellular involvement and a high mortality rate.",journal article
18160472,Kallmann's syndrome: a comparison of the reproductive phenotypes in men carrying KAL1 and FGFR1/KAL2 mutations.,"CONTEXT: Kallmann's syndrome (KS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder consisting of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) with anosmia or hyposmia. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the reproductive phenotypes of men harboring KAL1 and FGFR1/KAL2 mutations. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We studied the endocrine features reflecting gonadotropic-testicular axis function in 39 men; 21 had mutations in KAL1 and 18 in FGFR1/KAL2, but none had additional mutations in PROK-2 or PROKR-2 genes. RESULTS: Puberty failed to occur in the patients with KAL1 mutations, all of whom had complete CHH. Three patients with FGFR1/KAL2 mutations had normal puberty, were eugonadal, and had normal testosterone and gonadotropin levels. Cryptorchidism was more frequent (14 of 21 vs. 3 of 15; P<00.1) and testicular volume (2.4+/-1.1 vs. 5.4+/-2.4 ml; P<0.001) was smaller in CHH subjects with KAL1 mutations than in subjects with FGFR1/KAL2 mutations. The mean basal plasma FSH level (0.72+/-0.47 vs. 1.48+/-0.62 IU/liter; P<0.05), serum inhibin B level (19.3+/-10.6 vs. 39.5+/-19.3 pg/ml; P<0.005), basal LH plasma level (0.57+/-0.54 vs. 1.0+/-0.6 IU/liter; P<0.01), and GnRH-stimulated LH plasma level (1.2+/-1.0 vs. 4.1+/-3.5 IU/liter; P<0.01) were significantly lower in the subjects with KAL1 mutations. LH pulsatility was studied in 13 CHH subjects with KAL1 mutations and seven subjects with FGFR1/KAL2 mutations; LH secretion was nonpulsatile in all the subjects, but mean LH levels were lower in those with KAL1 mutations. CONCLUSION: KAL1 mutations result in a more severe reproductive phenotype than FGFR1/KAL2 mutations. The latter are associated with a broader spectrum of pubertal development and with less severe impairment of gonadotropin secretion.",research-article; journal article

22284829,X-linked megalocornea caused by mutations in CHRDL1 identifies an essential role for ventroptin in anterior segment development.,"X-linked megalocornea (MGC1) is an ocular anterior segment disorder characterized by an increased cornea diameter and deep anterior chamber evident at birth and later onset of mosaic corneal degeneration (shagreen), arcus juvenilis, and presenile cataracts. We identified copy-number variation, frameshift, missense, splice-site and nonsense mutations in the Chordin-like 1 gene (CHRDL1) on Xq23 as the cause of the condition in seven MGC1 families. CHRDL1 encodes ventroptin, a bone morphogenic protein antagonist with a proposed role in specification of topographic retinotectal projections. Electrophysiological evaluation revealed mild generalized cone system dysfunction and, in one patient, an interhemispheric asymmetry in visual evoked potentials. We show that CHRDL1 is expressed in the developing human cornea and anterior segment in addition to the retina. We explored the impact of loss of ventroptin function on brain function and morphology in vivo. CHRDL1 is differentially expressed in the human fetal brain, and there is high expression in cerebellum and neocortex. We show that MGC1 patients have a superior cognitive ability despite a striking focal loss of myelination of white matter. Our findings reveal an unexpected requirement for ventroptin during anterior segment development and the consequences of a lack of function in the retina and brain.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
25712132,Molecular mechanism of CHRDL1-mediated X-linked megalocornea in humans and in Xenopus model.,"Chordin-Like 1 (CHRDL1) mutations cause non-syndromic X-linked megalocornea (XMC) characterized by enlarged anterior eye segments. Mosaic corneal degeneration, presenile cataract and secondary glaucoma are associated with XMC. Beside that CHRDL1 encodes Ventroptin, a secreted bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist, the molecular mechanism of XMC is not well understood yet. In a family with broad phenotypic variability of XMC, we identified the novel CHRDL1 frameshift mutation c.807_808delTC [p.H270Wfs*22] presumably causing CHRDL1 loss of function. Using Xenopus laevis as model organism, we demonstrate that chrdl1 is specifically expressed in the ocular tissue at late developmental stages. The chrdl1 knockdown directly resembles the human XMC phenotype and confirms CHRDL1 deficiency to cause XMC. Interestingly, secondary to this bmp4 is down-regulated in the Xenopus eyes. Moreover, phospho-SMAD1/5 is altered and BMP receptor 1A is reduced in a XMC patient. Together, we classify these observations as negative-feedback regulation due to the deficient BMP antagonism in XMC. As CHRDL1 is preferentially expressed in the limbal stem cell niche of adult human cornea, we assume that CHRDL1 plays a key role in cornea homeostasis. In conclusion, we provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of XMC as well as into the specific role of CHRDL1 during cornea organogenesis, among others by the establishment of the first XMC in vivo model. We show that unravelling monogenic cornea disorders like XMC-with presumably disturbed cornea growth and differentiation-contribute to the identification of potential limbal stem cell niche factors that are promising targets for regenerative therapies of corneal injuries.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
15782410,Renpenning syndrome comes into focus.,"Renpenning syndrome represents a prototypic X-linked mental retardation condition with full expression of the phenotype in males and little or no expression in females. The predominant clinical findings are microcephaly, long narrow face, short stature with lean body build, and small testes. Mental retardation, usually of severe degree, occurs in 95% of cases. Less than 20% of cases have major malformations, the most common being cardiac defects and cleft palate. Subsequent to the description of mutations in the polyglutamine tract binding protein 1 (PQBP1) in Sutherland-Haan syndrome, Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome, MRX55, and two small XLMR families, a single nucleotide insertion has been found in the original family with Renpenning syndrome and an AGAG deletion in a second family with the Renpenning syndrome. Mutations have also been found in Golabi-Ito-Hall syndrome, Porteous syndrome, and an additional small family. It is now demonstrated that five named XLMR syndromes (Sutherland-Haan, Hamel cerebropalatocardiac, Golabi-Ito-Hall, Porteous, and Renpenning), one nonsyndromic family (MRX55), and three small XLMR families have PQBP1 mutations and are thus allelic XLMR entities. In acknowledgement of the historical importance of the original report of Renpenning syndrome [1962], we propose that the entities with PQBP1 mutations be combined under the name of Renpenning syndrome.",journal article; case reports

The clinical features in these and six other published families are reviewed. In general, the clinical picture is variable. Mental retardation ranges from mild to severe. Infantile spasms (West syndrome) occurred in 12.5% and other less severe forms of seizures in 37.5%. Characteristic dystonic movements of the hands were seen in 63% and dysarthria in 54%.

17701900,"Mutations in PRPS1, which encodes the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase enzyme critical for nucleotide biosynthesis, cause hereditary peripheral neuropathy with hearing loss and optic neuropathy (cmtx5).","We have identified missense mutations at conserved amino acids in the PRPS1 gene on Xq22.3 in two families with a syndromic form of inherited peripheral neuropathy, one of Asian and one of European descent. The disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, and the affected male patients invariably develop sensorineural hearing loss of prelingual type followed by gating disturbance and visual loss. The family of European descent was reported in 1967 as having Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome, and recently a Korean family with the same symptom triad was identified with a novel disease locus CMTX5 on the chromosome band Xq21.32-q24. PRPS1 (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1) is an isoform of the PRPS gene family and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, including cochlea. The enzyme mediates the biochemical step critical for purine metabolism and nucleotide biosynthesis. The mutations identified were E43D, in patients with Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome, and M115T, in the Korean patients with CMTX5. We also showed decreased enzyme activity in patients with M115T. PRPS1 is the first CMT gene that encodes a metabolic enzyme, shedding a new light on the understanding of peripheral nerve-specific metabolism and also suggesting the potential of PRPS1 as a target for drugs in prevention and treatment of peripheral neuropathy by antimetabolite therapy.",review-article; review; journal article

18485258,The molecular and cellular defects underlying Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.,"Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a recessive X-linked dysmyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). The most frequent cause of PMD is a genomic duplication of chromosome Xq22 including the region encoding the dosage-sensitive proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene. The PLP1 duplications are heterogeneous in size, unlike duplications causing many other genomic disorders, and arise by a distinct molecular mechanism. Other causes of PMD include PLP1 deletions, triplications and point mutations. Mutations in the PLP1 gene can also give rise to spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2), an allelic form of the disease. Thus, there is a spectrum of CNS disorder from mild SPG2 to severe connatal PMD. PLP1 encodes a major protein in CNS myelin and is abundantly expressed in oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS. Significant advances in our understanding of PMD have been achieved by investigating mutant PLP1 in PMD patients, animal models and in vitro studies. How the different PLP1 mutations and dosage effects give rise to PMD is being revealed. Interestingly, the underlying causes of pathogenesis are distinct for each of the different genetic abnormalities. This article reviews the genetics of PMD and summarises the current knowledge of causative molecular and cellular mechanisms.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
1598912,Point mutation in the DNA binding domain of the androgen receptor in two families with Reifenstein syndrome.,"Inadequate androgen action in genetic and gonadal males causes an intersex phenotype. We have analyzed the androgen receptor (AR) gene in male pseudohermaphrodites with normal specific binding of dihydrotestosterone in their genital skin fibroblasts. In five patients with Reifenstein syndrome we have detected a point mutation in the DNA binding domain. They are from two unrelated families and presented with perineoscrotal hypospadias and undescended testes. After puberty they showed small testes, no palpable prostate, micropenis, azoospermia, and gynecomastia. The mutation was discovered when cDNA fragments from three brothers were sequenced. For rapid detection of the mutation in heterozygous and hemizygous carriers, allele-specific PCRs and restriction-analysis techniques have been developed. Relatives of the patients, a group of normal blood donors, and other patients were screened with these methods. Among 41 intersex patients with incomplete virilization, another two brothers presenting with this mutation were identified. The mutation is a guanine-to-adenine transition at nucleotide 2314, which changes the alanine codon (GCC) immediately after the first cysteine of the second zinc finger motif of the AR into a threonine codon (ACC). The mutation was recreated in an AR expression vector, and wild-type as well as mutant ARs were expressed in COS-7 cells. Cotransfection experiments were made using a mouse mammary tumor virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. The ability of the mutant receptor to stimulate transcription of the reporter gene was reduced by about two-thirds, as compared with the wild-type receptor.",letter

The mutation spectrum is large and the phenotype variable.To determine whether there is a correlation between mutation type and disease severity.We identified the causative mutation in 86 affected patients and examined each of these patients in detail. Different categories of mutation were compared for each phenotypic characteristic.We found a reduction in visual acuity with increasing age and worsening macular pathology in patients over 30 years old (p < or = 0.001), but there was no correlation between mutation type and severity of disease. Furthermore, we found a wide variation in phenotype even within families.Identifying the causative mutation in patients with X-linked retinoschisis is helpful in confirming diagnosis and in counselling of family members but cannot be used to predict prognosis for an individual patient.","letter; research support, non-u.s. gov't"
11384589,Axial length and refractive error in X-linked retinoschisis.,"PURPOSE:To examine the relationship between axial length and refractive error in patients with X-linked retinoschisis. DESIGN:To determine whether the hypermetropia frequently found in patients with X-linked retinoschisis is axial hypermetropia. METHODS:The axial length and refractive error were measured in 29 right eyes of 29 patients. The patients were divided into two groups: a juvenile group with ages <13 years (12 eyes) and an adult group with ages > or =13 years (17 eyes). The axial length of the right eye of 30 adult men without eye diseases whose refractive error ranged from +/- 1.0 diopter served as controls. RESULTS:In the adult patient group, the refractive error was significantly more hypermetropic and the axial length was significantly shorter than was the normal adult group (P <.001). CONCLUSION:These results strongly suggest that the hypermetropia in patients with X-linked retinoschisis is axial hypermetropia.",journal article
10922205,Phenotypic expression of juvenile X-linked retinoschisis in Swedish families with different mutations in the XLRS1 gene.,"OBJECTIVE:To describe the clinical phenotype of juvenile X-linked retinoschisis in patients with different mutations in the XLRS1 gene. METHODS:Thirty patients with 7 different XLRS1 mutations were examined. The genotype was determined by molecular genetics, which identified 6 known and 1 novel mutation (exon 5, 489 G-->T). Ophthalmologic examination included full-field electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. RESULTS:The fundus appearance showed marked variations between, as well as within, families with different XLRS1 mutations. The ERG demonstrated typical reduction of B-wave amplitude, with relative A-wave preservation, causing a reduced B-A ratio in all affected males. The implicit time of the 30-Hz flicker ERG was prolonged in all patients examined. In a large family with a deletion of exon 1 and the promoter region, 12 affected males showed a phenotype ranging from moderate to severe vision impairment and a broad range of ERG abnormality, suggesting that additional factors may contribute to the disease severity. CONCLUSIONS:Juvenile retinoschisis shows a wide variability in the phenotype between, as well as within, families with different genotypes. The ERG findings show reduced B-A ratios of dark-adapted recordings and prolonged implicit times of 30-Hz flicker response, which provide a useful clinical marker to confirm the clinical diagnosis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:This study describes the wide variability in the phenotype in patients with juvenile retinoschisis and different mutations in the XLRS1 gene. The study emphasizes the importance of complementing the ophthalmologic examination with full-field ERG and molecular genetics in boys with visual failure of unknown etiology to determine the diagnosis early in the course of the disease.

8462096,Interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain mutation results in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency in humans.,"The interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor gamma chain (IL-2R gamma) is a component of high and intermediate affinity IL-2 receptors that is required to achieve full ligand binding affinity and internalization. We have localized the IL-2R gamma gene to human chromosome Xq13. Genetic linkage analysis indicates that the IL-2R gamma gene and the locus for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) appear to be at the same position. Moreover, we demonstrate that each of three unrelated patients with XSCID has a different mutation in his IL-2R gamma gene resulting in a different premature stop codon and predicted C-terminal truncation. These data establish that XSCID is associated with mutations of the IL-2R gamma gene product. Since XSCID is characterized by absent or markedly reduced numbers of T cells, our findings imply that IL-2R gamma plays a vital role in thymic maturation of T cells. These results also have important implications for prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, carrier female detection, and gene therapy for XSCID.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18657636,Novel EDA mutation resulting in X-linked non-syndromic hypodontia and the pattern of EDA-associated isolated tooth agenesis.,"Familial non-syndromic hypodontia shows a wide phenotypic heterogeneity and inherits in an autosomal-dominant, autosomal-recessive or X-linked mode. Mutations in genes PAX9, MSX1 and AXIN2 have been determined to be associated with autosomal-dominant tooth agenesis. Recent studies in two families showed that X-linked non-syndromic hypodontia resulted from EDA mutations. In this study, a novel EDA mutation (Thr338Met) that results in X-linked non-syndromic hypodontia in a Chinese family was identified. The patterns of tooth agenesis in these related subjects with defined EDA mutation were analyzed using comparative statistical analysis of tooth agenesis in EDA, MSX1 and PAX9. Statistically significant differences (p<0.001) were observed at eight positions. The resulting data of congenital absence of maxillary and mandibular central incisors, lateral incisors and canines, with the high possibility of persistence of maxillary and mandibular first permanent molars, appears as a pattern of tooth agenesis, suggesting the presence of an EDA mutation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16583127,A novel missense mutation of the EDA gene in a Mongolian family with congenital hypodontia.,"X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a rare disease characterized by the hypoplasia or absence of eccrine glands, dry skin, scant hair, and dental abnormalities. Here, we report a Mongolian family with congenital absence of teeth inherited in an X-linked fashion. The affected members of the family did not show other HED characteristics, except hypodontia. We successfully mapped the affected locus to chromosome Xq12-q13.1, and then found a novel missense mutation, c.193C>G, in the ectodysplasin A (EDA) gene in all affected males and carrier females. The mutation causes arginine to be replaced by glycine in codon 65 (R65G) in the juxtamembrane region of EDA. In addition, 33% (3/9) of female carriers have a skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern. Our result strongly suggests that the c.193C>G mutation is the disease-causing mutation in this family.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23623388,ZC4H2 mutations are associated with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and intellectual disability through impairment of central and peripheral synaptic plasticity.,"Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is caused by heterogeneous pathologies leading to multiple antenatal joint contractures through fetal akinesia. Understanding the pathophysiology of this disorder is important for clinical care of the affected individuals and genetic counseling of the families. We thus aimed to establish the genetic basis of an AMC subtype that is associated with multiple dysmorphic features and intellectual disability (ID). We used haplotype analysis, next-generation sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization, and chromosome breakpoint mapping to identify the pathogenic mutations in families and simplex cases. Suspected disease variants were verified by cosegregation analysis. We identified disease-causing mutations in the zinc-finger gene ZC4H2 in four families affected by X-linked AMC plus ID and one family affected by cerebral palsy. Several heterozygous females were also affected, but to a lesser degree. Furthermore, we found two ZC4H2 deletions and one rearrangement in two female and one male unrelated simplex cases, respectively. In mouse primary hippocampal neurons, transiently produced ZC4H2 localized to the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses, and the altered protein influenced dendritic spine density. In zebrafish, antisense-morpholino-mediated zc4h2 knockdown caused abnormal swimming and impaired α-motoneuron development. All missense mutations identified herein failed to rescue the swimming defect of zebrafish morphants. We conclude that ZC4H2 point mutations, rearrangements, and small deletions cause a clinically variable broad-spectrum neurodevelopmental disorder of the central and peripheral nervous systems in both familial and simplex cases of both sexes. Our results highlight the importance of ZC4H2 for genetic testing of individuals presenting with ID plus muscle weakness and minor or major forms of AMC.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
12793612,True hermaphroditism in an XY individual due to a familial point mutation of the SRY gene.,"A number of genes are known to control the development of the testis but the transcription factor SRY encoded on the Y-chromosome is considered to play the major role in initiating the first step in determining testicular differentiation. Mutations in this gene usually result in gonadal dysgenesis, but it is interesting to note that at least three of these mutations have been found to be familial. Furthermore, fewer than 10% of true hermaphrodites carry an XY karyotype, and so far only two patients have been documented to carry a mutation in the SRY gene. We have identified a familial mutation in the SRY gene involving a previously described locus. The index patient was born with severely ambiguous genitalia and on histological examination the gonads revealed true hermaphroditism, containing ovarian as well as testicular tissue. The father, his three brothers, and his first-born son carry the identical mutation. The severely feminized XY individual was diagnosed shortly after birth, gonadectomized and raised as female. SRY was determined by PCR and subsequently sequenced using cycle sequencing. A previously published point mutation was identified at nucleotide position 680 resulting in a non-conservative exchange of the amino acid iso-leucine at position 90 into methionine. This position represents a mutational 'hot spot', which seems to retain a certain amount of protein activity, enabling normal male development in some individuals. The patient is the third one reported in whom a mutation in the SRY gene results in ovarian-like development. Since ovarian development in XY individuals is extremely rare, its mechanism is of great interest. Further studies in this family might allow the identification of factors initiating and stimulating ovarian development. How far these infantile ovaries would have developed normally, however, is merely speculative.",journal article
30341416,TBL1Y: a new gene involved in syndromic hearing loss.,"Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is an extremely heterogeneous disorder with autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked forms. Here, we described an Italian pedigree affected by HHL but also prostate hyperplasia and increased ratio of the free/total PSA levels, with the unusual and extremely rare Y-linked pattern of inheritance. Using exome sequencing we found a missense variant (r.206A>T leading to p.Asp69Val) in the TBL1Y gene. TBL1Y is homologous of TBL1X, whose partial deletion has described to be involved in X-linked hearing loss. Here, we demonstrate that it has a restricted expression in adult human cochlea and prostate and the variant identified induces a lower protein stability caused by misfolded mutated protein that impairs its cellular function. These findings indicate that TBL1Y could be considered a novel candidate for HHL.",research-article; journal article; case reports
19720722,Molecular basis of infantile reversible cytochrome c oxidase deficiency myopathy.,"Childhood-onset mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are usually severe, relentlessly progressive conditions that have a fatal outcome. However, a puzzling infantile disorder, long known as 'benign cytochrome c oxidase deficiency myopathy' is an exception because it shows spontaneous recovery if infants survive the first months of life. Current investigations cannot distinguish those with a good prognosis from those with terminal disease, making it very difficult to decide when to continue intensive supportive care. Here we define the principal molecular basis of the disorder by identifying a maternally inherited, homoplasmic m.14674T>C mt-tRNA(Glu) mutation in 17 patients from 12 families. Our results provide functional evidence for the pathogenicity of the mutation and show that tissue-specific mechanisms downstream of tRNA(Glu) may explain the spontaneous recovery. This study provides the rationale for a simple genetic test to identify infants with mitochondrial myopathy and good prognosis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17620573,Novel compound heterozygous TULP1 mutations in a family with severe early-onset retinitis pigmentosa.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and determine the genetic defect in a Surinamese family with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. METHODS: Family members underwent blood sampling and ophthalmologic examinations. After exclusion of all known mutations in all genes involved in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, a genome-wide linkage scan was performed using 11,555 single-nucleotide polymorphisms spread throughout the genome. Mutation analysis of the TULP1 gene was performed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: All affected family members had a severe retinal dystrophy with a history of nystagmus, low visual acuity, and nyctalopia since infancy. The scotopic and photopic responses were nonrecordable on electroretinography. A genome-wide scan suggested linkage to the chromosomal region containing the TULP1 gene. Mutation analysis of TULP1 identified novel compound heterozygous mutations (p.Arg482Trp and p.Leu504fsX140) in all affected family members. CONCLUSIONS: The affected members of the Surinamese family have a severe early-onset form of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, which is caused by compound heterozygous mutations in the TULP1 gene. Clinical Relevance Clinical and molecular genetic characterization of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa may help to provide a more accurate prognosis in individual patients. This study confirms that TULP1 mutations cause a severe early-onset form of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the peripheral retina, leading to night blindness and loss of the peripheral visual field. PRPF31 is one of four pre-mRNA splicing factors identified as causing autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, with incomplete penetrance being the unique feature associated with mutations in this gene. The purpose of this study was to identify PRPF31 mutations in a cohort of 118 cases of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and determine the genotype-phenotype correlation emerging from the spectrum of mutations in this gene.Probands with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa underwent ophthalmic evaluation. Blood samples were obtained, genomic DNA was isolated, and PRPF31 exons along with adjacent splice junctions were amplified by PCR and screened by direct sequencing.In the 118 individuals with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, six mutations were identified, of which four were novel. One previously known splice site mutation was identified in two other apparently unrelated families.Mutations in PRPF31 causing adRP were present in nearly 5% of a mixed U.K. population. The age of onset and the severity of the disease varied with different mutations. In addition, individuals carrying the same mutation showed a range of phenotypic variation, suggesting the involvement of other modifying genes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20939871,Prevalence and novelty of PRPF31 mutations in French autosomal dominant rod-cone dystrophy patients and a review of published reports.,"BACKGROUND: Rod-cone dystrophies are heterogeneous group of inherited retinal disorders both clinically and genetically characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. The mode of inheritance can be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked. The purpose of this study was to identify mutations in one of the genes, PRPF31, in French patients with autosomal dominant RP, to perform genotype-phenotype correlations of those patients, to determine the prevalence of PRPF31 mutations in this cohort and to review previously identified PRPF31 mutations from other cohorts. METHODS: Detailed phenotypic characterization was performed including precise family history, best corrected visual acuity using the ETDRS chart, slit lamp examination, kinetic and static perimetry, full field and multifocal ERG, fundus autofluorescence imaging and optic coherence tomography. For genetic diagnosis, genomic DNA of ninety families was isolated by standard methods. The coding exons and flanking intronic regions of PRPF31 were PCR amplified, purified and sequenced in the index patient. RESULTS: We showed for the first time that 6.7% cases of a French adRP cohort have a PRPF31 mutation. We identified in total six mutations, which were all novel and not detected in ethnically matched controls. The mutation spectrum from our cohort comprises frameshift and splice site mutations. Co-segregation analysis in available family members revealed that each index patient and all affected family members showed a heterozygous mutation. In five families incomplete penetrance was observed. Most patients showed classical signs of RP with relatively preserved central vision and visual field. CONCLUSION: Our studies extended the mutation spectrum of PRPF31 and as previously reported in other populations, it is a major cause of adRP in France.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article"
23041261,A novel 7 bp deletion in PRPF31 associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa with incomplete penetrance in an Indian family.,"To localize and identify the gene linked with non-syndromic autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) with high but not complete penetrance in an Indian family. A detailed family history and clinical data were recorded. A genome-wide scan by 2-point linkage analysis using nearly 400 fluorescently labeled microsatellite markers in combination with multipoint lod score and haplotype analysis was carried out. Mutation screening was performed in the candidate gene by bidirectional sequence analysis of the amplified products. A maximum 2-point lod score of 3.553 at theta = 0.0 was obtained with marker D19S572. Haplotype analysis placed the RP locus distal to marker D19S572, in close proximity to the gene for pre-mRNA processing factor 31 (PRPF31) at 19q13.42. Mutation screening in all 14 exonic regions and adjacent flanking intronic sequences of PRPF31 revealed a novel 7 bp deletion, c.59_65del7 (p.Gly20AlafsX43), in the first coding exon of PRPF31. This leads to a premature termination codon (PTC) in the next exon, 43 amino acids downstream. The observed 7 bp deletion in PRPF31 was identified in all the tested 10 affected members and in an unaffected individual, consistent with a high, but not the complete penetrance of c.59_65del7 (p.Gly20AlafsX43). This deletion was not observed in other tested six unaffected family members or in 100 ethnically matched control subjects. The present study describes mapping of a locus for non-syndromic adRP at 19q13.42 (RP11 locus) in a family of Indian origin and identifies a novel deletion, c.59_65del7, in PRPF31 within the mapped interval. Since the mutant PRPF31 is truncated relatively close to the N-terminus of the protein, haploinsufficiency rather than aberrant protein formation is likely to be the underlying mechanism of the disease. The present findings further substantiate the role of PRPF31 that encodes a component of the spliceosome complex in relation to ADRP.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15258860,Comparative genomic analysis identifies an ADP-ribosylation factor-like gene as the cause of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS3).,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous, pleiotropic human disorder characterized by obesity, retinopathy, polydactyly, renal and cardiac malformations, learning disabilities, and hypogenitalism. Eight BBS loci have been mapped, and seven genes have been identified. BBS3 was previously mapped to chromosome 3 by linkage analysis in a large Israeli Bedouin kindred. The rarity of other families mapping to the BBS3 locus has made it difficult to narrow the disease interval sufficiently to identify the gene by positional cloning. We hypothesized that the genomes of model organisms that contained the orthologues to known BBS genes would also likely contain a BBS3 orthologue. Therefore, comparative genomic analysis was performed to prioritize BBS candidate genes for mutation screening. Known BBS proteins were compared with the translated genomes of model organisms to identify a subset of organisms in which these proteins were conserved. By including multiple organisms that have relatively small genome sizes in the analysis, the number of candidate genes was reduced, and a few genes mapping to the BBS3 interval emerged as the best candidates for this disorder. One of these genes, ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6 (ARL6), contains a homozygous stop mutation that segregates completely with the disease in the Bedouin kindred originally used to map the BBS3 locus, identifying this gene as the BBS3 gene. These data illustrate the power of comparative genomic analysis for the study of human disease and identifies a novel BBS gene.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
25574826,"CODAS syndrome is associated with mutations of LONP1, encoding mitochondrial AAA+ Lon protease.","CODAS syndrome is a multi-system developmental disorder characterized by cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular, and skeletal anomalies. Using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing, we identified four LONP1 mutations inherited as homozygous or compound-heterozygous combinations among ten individuals with CODAS syndrome. The individuals come from three different ancestral backgrounds (Amish-Swiss from United States, n = 8; Mennonite-German from Canada, n = 1; mixed European from Canada, n = 1). LONP1 encodes Lon protease, a homohexameric enzyme that mediates protein quality control, respiratory-complex assembly, gene expression, and stress responses in mitochondria. All four pathogenic amino acid substitutions cluster within the AAA(+) domain at residues near the ATP-binding pocket. In biochemical assays, pathogenic Lon proteins show substrate-specific defects in ATP-dependent proteolysis. When expressed recombinantly in cells, all altered Lon proteins localize to mitochondria. The Old Order Amish Lon variant (LONP1 c.2161C>G[p.Arg721Gly]) homo-oligomerizes poorly in vitro. Lymphoblastoid cell lines generated from affected children have (1) swollen mitochondria with electron-dense inclusions and abnormal inner-membrane morphology; (2) aggregated MT-CO2, the mtDNA-encoded subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase; and (3) reduced spare respiratory capacity, leading to impaired mitochondrial proteostasis and function. CODAS syndrome is a distinct, autosomal-recessive, developmental disorder associated with dysfunction of the mitochondrial Lon protease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
7895015,Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. A distinctive clinical disorder.,"The disorder of autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy has recently been identified, and is now delineated in detail. A phenotypically homogeneous group of five families from Australia, Britain and Canada, containing 47 affected individuals, was studied. The largest family contained 25 affected individuals spanning six generations. This disorder is characterized by clusters of brief nocturnal motor seizures, with hyperkinetic or tonic manifestations. Subjects often experienced an aura, and remained aware throughout the attacks. Seizures occurred in clusters (mean eight attacks/night) typically as the individual dozed, or shortly before awakening. The epilepsy usually began in childhood, and persisted through adult life, with considerable intra-family variation in severity. Seizures were often misdiagnosed as benign nocturnal parasomnias, psychiatric and medical disorders. Interictal EEG studies were unhelpful. Ictal video-EEG studies showed that the attacks were partial seizures with frontal lobe seizure semiology. Neuro-imaging was normal. Carbamazepine monotherapy was frequently effective. This disorder showed autosomal dominant inheritance. Recognition of this entity is clinically important for diagnosis, appropriate therapy and genetic counselling. Moreover, this disorder now offers an opportunity to identify a gene for partial epilepsy.",research-article; journal article
14623738,A Korean kindred with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and mental retardation.,"BACKGROUND: A Korean family had distinctive clinical and neuroimaging features and carried the same genetic mutation that was found in a previously described Japanese kindred with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: To describe the first Korean family with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: Members of a large family, including 9 affected individuals from 3 generations, underwent a comprehensive genetic, clinical, electroencephalographic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging evaluation. Affected members were tested for possible mutations in transmembrane regions 1 through 3 of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 subunit (CHRNA4) by direct sequencing and subsequent restriction analysis. RESULTS: Seizures began in childhood, presenting as nocturnal episodes of staring, confusion, shouting, perioral movements, unintelligible speech, and hand waving. Some patients had ictal or interictal epileptiform activity in the temporal and/or frontocentral areas. Neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging results showed no abnormalities, except that all patients available for testing had mild to moderate mental retardation. Fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 with positron emission tomography showed mild decreased glucose uptake in the superior and middle frontal regions, more so on the left than on the right. Patient response to carbamazepine was poor. All affected members were heterozygous for the CHRNA4 Ser252Leu mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Disorders associated with mutations in the transmembrane region 2 of CHRNA4 are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. Distinctive features of this kindred include (1) mental retardation in all affected members available for testing, (2) abnormal brain findings on fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 with positron emission tomography, (3) poor response to carbamazepine, and (4) full penetrance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

1999498,Infantile form of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency with hepatomuscular symptoms and sudden death. Physiopathological approach to carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiencies.,"Reported cases of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency are characterized only by a muscular symptomatology in young adults although the defect is expressed in extra-muscular tissues as well as in skeletal muscle. We describe here a CPT II deficiency associating hypoketotic hypoglycemia, high plasma creatine kinase level, heart beat disorders, and sudden death in a 3-mo-old boy. CPT II defect (-90%) diagnosed in fibroblasts is qualitatively similar to that (-75%) of two ""classical"" CPT II-deficient patients previously studied: It resulted from a decreased amount of CPT II probably arising from its reduced biosynthesis. Consequences of CPT II deficiency studied in fibroblasts differed in both sets of patients. An impaired oxidation of long-chain fatty acids was found in the proband but not in patients with the ""classical"" form of the deficiency. The metabolic and clinical consequences of CPT II deficiency might depend, in part, on the magnitude of residual CPT II activity. With 25% residual activity CPT II would become rate limiting in skeletal muscle but not in liver, heart, and fibroblasts. As observed in the patient described herein, CPT II activity ought to be more reduced to induce an impaired oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in these tissues.",editorial
15563508,Mutant carbonic anhydrase 4 impairs pH regulation and causes retinal photoreceptor degeneration.,"Retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) belong to the metabolically most active tissues in the human body. Efficient removal of acid load from retina and RPE is a critical function mediated by the choriocapillaris. However, the mechanism by which pH homeostasis is maintained is largely unknown. Here, we show that a functional complex of carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4) and Na+/bicarbonate co-transporter 1 (NBC1) is specifically expressed in the choriocapillaris and that missense mutations in CA4 linked to autosomal dominant rod-cone dystrophy disrupt NBC1-mediated HCO3- transport. Our results identify a novel pathogenic pathway in which a defect in a functional complex involved in maintaining pH balances, but not expressed in retina or RPE, leads to photoreceptor degeneration. The importance of a functional CA4 for survival of photoreceptors implies that CA inhibitors, which are widely used as medications, particularly in the treatment of glaucoma, may have long-term adverse effects on vision.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15280904,Clinical features and molecular analysis of seven British kindreds with hereditary hyperferritinaemia cataract syndrome.,"Hereditary hyperferritinaemia cataract syndrome (HHCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by early onset cataracts and increased serum L-ferritin concentration. Affected individuals show nucleotide substitutions in the region of the L-ferritin gene (FTL) that encodes a regulatory sequence within the (mRNA)FTL termed the iron responsive element (IRE). We report the clinical features of seven HHCS kindreds containing 49 individuals with premature cataract. All the probands received diagnoses of HHCS after the incidental discovery of increased serum L-ferritin concentration (median 1420 microg/l; normal range 15-360 microg/l), in most cases during investigation or screening for anaemia. All the probands developed characteristic 'sunflower' morphology cataracts in childhood (median age at diagnosis 5 years), but had no other phenotypic features. All the affected kindreds showed nucleotide substitutions in FTL that were predicted to disrupt function of the (mRNA)FTL IRE. The severity of the clinical phenotype of HHCS was variable both within and between kindreds and showed no clear relationship to FTL genotype. HHCS should be included in the differential diagnosis of hyperferritinaemia and should be carefully distinguished from hereditary haemochromatosis. Measurement of the serum L-ferritin concentration should be included in the investigation of all individuals with early onset cataracts.",journal article
7477289,A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality.,"Transsexuals have the strong feeling, often from childhood onwards, of having been born the wrong sex. The possible psychogenic or biological aetiology of transsexuality has been the subject of debate for many years. Here we show that the volume of the central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BSTc), a brain area that is essential for sexual behaviour, is larger in men than in women. A female-sized BSTc was found in male-to-female transsexuals. The size of the BSTc was not influenced by sex hormones in adulthood and was independent of sexual orientation. Our study is the first to show a female brain structure in genetically male transsexuals and supports the hypothesis that gender identity develops as a result of an interaction between the developing brain and sex hormones.",review-article; review; journal article
11850618,"Dominant and recessive deafness caused by mutations of a novel gene, TMC1, required for cochlear hair-cell function.","Positional cloning of hereditary deafness genes is a direct approach to identify molecules and mechanisms underlying auditory function. Here we report a locus for dominant deafness, DFNA36, which maps to human chromosome 9q13-21 in a region overlapping the DFNB7/B11 locus for recessive deafness. We identified eight mutations in a new gene, transmembrane cochlear-expressed gene 1 (TMC1), in a DFNA36 family and eleven DFNB7/B11 families. We detected a 1.6-kb genomic deletion encompassing exon 14 of Tmc1 in the recessive deafness (dn) mouse mutant, which lacks auditory responses and has hair-cell degeneration. TMC1 and TMC2 on chromosome 20p13 are members of a gene family predicted to encode transmembrane proteins. Tmc1 mRNA is expressed in hair cells of the postnatal mouse cochlea and vestibular end organs and is required for normal function of cochlear hair cells.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
17377520,Mutation in the PYK2-binding domain of PITPNM3 causes autosomal dominant cone dystrophy (CORD5) in two Swedish families.,"Autosomal dominant cone dystrophy (CORD5) (MIM 600977) is a rare disease predominantly affecting cone photoreceptors. Here we refine the CORD5 locus previously mapped to 17p13 from 27 to 14.3 cM and identified a missense mutation, Q626H in the phosphatidylinositol transfer (PIT) membrane-associated protein (PITPNM3) (MIM 608921) in two Swedish families. PITPNM3, known as a human homologue of the Drosophila retinal degeneration B (rdgB), lacks the N-terminal PIT domain needed for transport of phospholipids, renewal of photoreceptors membrane and providing the electroretinogram (ERG) response to light. In our study, the mutation causing CORD5 is located in the C-terminal region interacting with a member of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, PYK2. Our finding on the first mutation in the human homologue of Drosophila rdgB indicates novel pathways and a potential important role of the PITPNM3 in mammalian phototransduction.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

We have previously assigned the disease locus to chromosome 14q23-q24. Here we report on a novel variant of ARVD, which is transmitted associated to 1q42-q43 and is characterized by a concealed form, showing effort-induced polymorphic tachycardias. Since both loci ARVD1 and ARVD2 map in proximity of alpha-actinin genes, the possible implication of these myofibrillar proteins in the pathogenesis of ARVD is discussed. Two additional ARVD families, tested with markers of chromosomes 1q42-q43 and 14q23-q24, failed to show linkage, providing evidence of further genetic heterogeneity.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Symptoms include exercise-induced impairment of skeletal muscle relaxation, stiffness and cramps. Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ ATPase activities are reduced in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to the prediction that Brody disease results from defects in the ATP2A1 gene on chromosome 16p12.1-12.2, encoding SERCA1, the fast-twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase. A recent search, however, did not reveal any mutations in the ATP2A1 gene in three Brody patients. We have now associated Brody disease with the autosomal recessive inheritance of three ATP2A1 mutations in two families, suggesting that the disease is genetically heterogeneous. One mutation occurs at the splice donor site of intron 3, while the other two mutations lead to premature stop codons, truncating SERCA1, deleting essential functional domains and raising the intriguing question: how have these Brody patients partially compensated for the functional knockout of a gene product believed to be essential for fast-twitch skeletal muscle relaxation?","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
30160832,Further delineation of Aymé-Gripp syndrome and use of automated facial analysis tool.,"Aymé-Gripp syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by specific heterozygous variants in MAF. The resulting aberrant protein shows impaired GSK-mediated MAF phosphorylation. AGS is characterized by congenital cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, short stature, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features with brachycephaly. Cardiac and joint phenotypes are present in nearly half of patients. We review information on 10 published individuals with MAF mutations and clinical AGS and describe five additional patients, including three with novel mutations. Joint problems, typically including radioulnar synostosis and joint limitations, were present in 9/15 patients. Hip replacement in young adulthood was needed in four patients. Pericarditis occurred in 6/15 individuals. An automated facial analysis of 2D photos was used to compare the facial phenotype of 13 individuals from the literature or reported here, with facial photos of a control cohort of unaffected individuals and a cohort of Down syndrome patients. A multiclass approach yielded an accuracy of 86.86% and 89.05%, respectively, in two independent experiments compared to a random chance of 37.74%. In binary comparisons of AGS and Down syndrome, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.994 (P < .001) and 1.0 (P < .001), respectively. Binary comparisons of AGS and unaffected controls yielded AUC of 0.994 (P < .001) and 0.989 (P = .003), respectively, suggesting that the facial phenotype of AGS could clearly be distinguished from unaffected individuals and from Down syndrome patients. Automated facial analysis may be helpful in the identification and evaluation of individuals suspected to have AGS.",journal article; case reports

PPBs consist of mesenchymal cells that are susceptible to malignant transformation and cysts lined by epithelial cells. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the cysts by mesenchymal cells leads to sarcoma formation. Here, we show that 11 multiplex PPB families harbor heterozygous germline mutations in DICER1, a gene encoding an endoribonuclease critical to the generation of small noncoding regulatory RNAs. Expression of DICER1 protein was undetectable in the epithelial component of PPB tumors but was retained in the malignant mesenchyme (sarcoma).

Constitutional DICER1 mutations were identified in 19 families including 11/14 with PPB, 2/3 with cystic nephroma, 4/7 with ovarian Sertoli-Leydig-type tumours, 1/243 with Wilms tumour (this patient also had a Sertoli-Leydig tumour), 1/1 with intraocular medulloepithelioma (this patient also had PPB), 1/86 with medulloblastoma/infratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumour, and 1/172 with germ cell tumour. The inheritance was investigated in 17 families. DICER1 mutations were identified in 25 relatives: 17 were unaffected, one mother had ovarian Sertoli-Leydig tumour, one half-sibling had cystic nephroma, and six relatives had non-toxic thyroid cysts/goitre. Analysis of eight tumours from DICER1 mutation-positive patients showed universal retention of the wild-type allele. DICER1 truncating mutations were identified in 4/781 cancer cell lines; all were in microsatellite unstable lines and therefore unlikely to be driver mutations.Constitutional DICER1 haploinsufficiency predisposes to a broad range of tumours, making a substantial contribution to PPB, cystic nephroma and ovarian Sertoli-Leydig tumours, but a smaller contribution to other tumours. Most mutation carriers are unaffected, indicating that tumour risk is modest. The authors define the clinical contexts in which DICER1 mutation testing should be considered, the associated tumour risks, and the implications for at-risk individuals.

Multipoint analysis gave a maximum LOD score of 5.2 (theta max = 0.06) between these two markers. From haplotype analysis, the cataract locus lies in the 13 cM interval between markers D17S849 and D17S796.

BACKGROUND:Naxos disease is a recessively inherited ARVC caused by a mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin (cell adhesion protein) in which the cardiac phenotype is associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair. METHODS:Twelve families with Naxos disease underwent cardiac and molecular genetic investigation. Serial cardiac assessment with annual resting 12-lead and 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) and two-dimensional echocardiography was performed during 1 to 16 years, median 7 +/- 6 years in all 78 surviving members. RESULTS:Twenty-eight surviving members were homozygous and 40 were heterozygous for the mutation. All adults who were homozygous (n = 26) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ARVC, the youngest by the age of 13 years. In eight who were heterozygous, minor ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities were observed. Of the 26 subjects who were affected homozygotes, 92% showed ECG abnormalities, 92% ventricular arrhythmias, 100% right ventricular structural alterations and 27% left ventricular involvement. During follow-up (10 +/- 6 years), 16 (62%) developed structural progression, 12 (46%) arrhythmic events and 7 (27%) heart failure. The annual disease-related and sudden death mortality was 3% and 2.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:Autosomal recessive ARVC caused by a mutation in plakoglobin was 100% penetrant by adolescence. Affected subjects who were homozygous experienced progressive disease with adverse prognosis. A minority of subjects who were heterozygous showed minor ECG/echocardiographic changes, but clinically significant disease did not develop.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

15852040,Construction of a natural panel of 11p11.2 deletions and further delineation of the critical region involved in Potocki-Shaffer syndrome.,"Potocki-Shaffer syndrome (PSS) is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome that results from haploinsufficiency of at least two genes within the short arm of chromosome 11[del(11)(p11.2p12)]. The clinical features of PSS can include developmental delay, mental retardation, multiple exostoses, parietal foramina, enlarged anterior fontanel, minor craniofacial anomalies, ophthalmologic anomalies, and genital abnormalities in males. We constructed a natural panel of 11p11.2-p13 deletions using cell lines from 10 affected individuals, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), microsatellite analyses, and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). We then compared the deletion sizes and clinical features between affected individuals. The full spectrum of PSS manifests when deletions are at least 2.1 Mb in size, spanning from D11S1393 to D11S1385/D11S1319 (44.6-46.7 Mb from the 11p terminus) and encompassing EXT2, responsible for multiple exostoses, and ALX4, causing parietal foramina. Yet one subject with parietal foramina whose deletion does not include ALX4 indicates that ALX4 in this subject may be rendered functionally haploinsufficient by a position effect. Based on comparative deletion mapping of eight individuals with the full PSS syndrome including mental retardation and two PSS families with no mental retardation, at least one gene related to mental retardation is likely located between D11S554 and D11S1385/D11S1319, 45.6-46.7 Mb from the 11p terminus.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

16380919,NF1 gene mutations represent the major molecular event underlying neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) demonstrates phenotypic overlap with Noonan syndrome (NS) in some patients, which results in the so-called neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS). From a genetic point of view, NFNS is a poorly understood condition, and controversy remains as to whether it represents a variable manifestation of either NF1 or NS or is a distinct clinical entity. To answer this question, we screened a cohort with clinically well-characterized NFNS for mutations in the entire coding sequence of the NF1 and PTPN11 genes. Heterozygous NF1 defects were identified in 16 of the 17 unrelated subjects included in the study, which provides evidence that mutations in NF1 represent the major molecular event underlying this condition. Lesions included nonsense mutations, out-of-frame deletions, missense changes, small inframe deletions, and one large multiexon deletion. Remarkably, a high prevalence of inframe defects affecting exons 24 and 25, which encode a portion of the GAP-related domain of the protein, was observed. On the other hand, no defect in PTPN11 was observed, and no lesion affecting exons 11-27 of the NF1 gene was identified in 100 PTPN11 mutation-negative subjects with NS, which provides further evidence that NFNS and NS are genetically distinct disorders. These results support the view that NFNS represents a variant of NF1 and is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene, some of which have been demonstrated to cause classic NF1 in other individuals.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case-report"

We present an informative family with an unusual NF1 mutation with variable features of NF1 and Noonan syndrome. We hypothesize that an NF1 mutant allele can lead to diagnostic manifestations of Noonan syndrome, supporting the hypothesis that NF1 allelic heterogeneity causes NFNS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
20042462,Functional SNP of ARHGEF10 confers risk of atherothrombotic stroke.,"Although stroke is a common cause of death and a major cause of disability all over the world, genetic components of common forms of ischemic stroke are largely unknown. To identify susceptibility genes of atherothrombotic stroke, we performed a large case-control association study and a replication study in a total of 2775 cases with atherothrombotic stroke and 2839 controls. Through the analysis in 860 cases and 860 age- and sex-matched controls, we found that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2280887, in the ARHGEF10 gene was significantly associated with atherothrombotic stroke even after the adjustment of multiple testing by a permutation test [unadjusted P = 1.2 x 10(-6), odds ratio = 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.42-2.28]. This association was replicated in independent 1915 cases and 1979 controls. Subsequent fine mapping found another three SNPs which showed similar association due to strong linkage disequilibrium to rs2280887 (r(2) > 0.95). In the functional analyses of these four highly associated SNPs, using luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay we found that rs4376531 affected ARHGEF10 transcriptional activity due to the different Sp1-binding affinity. In small GTPase activity assay, we found that a gene product of ARHGEF10 specifically activated RhoA. A population-based cohort study revealed the subjects with rs4376531 CC or CG to increase the incidence of ischemic stroke (P = 0.033, hazard ratio = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.05-3.04). Our data suggest that the functional SNP of ARHGEF10 confers the susceptibility to atherothrombotic stroke.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
11830488,In vitro analyses of known and novel RUNX1/AML1 mutations in dominant familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia: implications for mechanisms of pathogenesis.,"Familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML) is an autosomal dominant familial platelet disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and a propensity to develop AML. Mutation analyses of RUNX1 in 3 families with FPD/AML showing linkage to chromosome 21q22.1 revealed 3 novel heterozygous point mutations (K83E, R135fsX177 (IVS4 + 3delA), and Y260X). Functional investigations of the 7 FPD/AML RUNX1 Runt domain point mutations described to date (2 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 3 missense mutations) were performed. Consistent with the position of the mutations in the Runt domain at the RUNX1-DNA interface, DNA binding of all mutant RUNX1 proteins was absent or significantly decreased. In general, missense and nonsense RUNX1 proteins retained the ability to heterodimerize with PEBP2beta/CBFbeta and inhibited transactivation of a reporter gene by wild-type RUNX1. Colocalization of mutant RUNX1 and PEBP2beta/CBFbeta in the cytoplasm was observed. These results suggest that the sequestration of PEBP2beta/CBFbeta by mutant RUNX1 may cause the inhibitory effects. While haploinsufficiency of RUNX1 causes FPD/AML in some families (deletions and frameshifts), mutant RUNX1 proteins (missense and nonsense) may also inhibit wild-type RUNX1, possibly creating a higher propensity to develop leukemia. This is consistent with the hypothesis that a second mutation has to occur, either in RUNX1 or another gene, to cause leukemia among individuals harboring RUNX1 FPD/AML mutations and that the propensity to acquire these additional mutations is determined, at least partially, by the initial RUNX1 mutation.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17221859,Conspicuous involvement of desmin tail mutations in diverse cardiac and skeletal myopathies.,"Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) encompasses a genetically heterogeneous group of human diseases caused by mutations in genes coding for structural proteins of muscle. Mutations in the intermediate filament (IF) protein desmin (DES), a major cytoskeletal component of myocytes, lead to severe forms of ""desminopathy,"" which affects cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle. Most mutations described reside in the central alpha-helical rod domain of desmin. Here we report three novel mutations--c.1325C>T (p.T442I), c.1360C>T (p.R454W), and c.1379G>T (p.S460I)--located in desmin's non-alpha-helical carboxy-terminal ""tail"" domain. We have investigated the impact of these and four--c.1237G>A (p.E413K), c.1346A>C (p.K449T), c.1353C>G (p.I451M), and c.1405G>A (p.V469M)--previously described ""tail"" mutations on in vitro filament formation and on the generation of ordered cytoskeletal arrays in transfected myoblasts. Although all but two mutants (p.E413K, p.R454W) assembled into IFs in vitro and all except p.E413K were incorporated into IF arrays in transfected C2C12 cells, filament properties differed significantly from wild-type desmin as revealed by viscometric assembly assays. Most notably, when coassembled with wild-type desmin, these mutants revealed a severe disturbance of filament-formation competence and filament-filament interactions, indicating an inherent incompatibility of mutant and wild-type protein to form mixed filaments. The various clinical phenotypes observed may reflect altered interactions of desmin's tail domain with different components of the myoblast cytoskeleton leading to diminished biomechanical properties and/or altered metabolism of the individual myocyte. Our in vitro assembly regimen proved to be a very sensible tool to detect if a particular desmin mutation is able to cause filament abnormalities.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
9697706,Missense mutations in desmin associated with familial cardiac and skeletal myopathy.,"Desmin-related myopathy (OMIM 601419) is a familial disorder characterized by skeletal muscle weakness associated with cardiac conduction blocks, arrhythmias and restrictive heart failure, and by intracytoplasmic accumulation of desmin-reactive deposits in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Involvement of the desmin gene (DES) has been excluded in three families diagnosed with desmin-related myopathy. We report two new families with desmin-related cardioskeletal myopathy associated with mutations in the highly conserved carboxy-terminal end of the desmin rod domain. A heterozygous A337P mutation was identified in a family with an adult-onset skeletal myopathy and mild cardiac involvement. Compound heterozygosity for two other mutations, A360P and N393I, was detected in a second family characterized by childhood-onset aggressive course of cardiac and skeletal myopathy.",journal article
10970245,Autosomal dominant myofibrillar myopathy with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy linked to chromosome 10q.,"Twenty-one members of a Swedish family suffering from myopathy and cardiomyopathy underwent neurological and cardiological investigations. Medical charts of 2 affected deceased patients were reviewed. Twelve patients had myopathy. The distribution of weakness was axial in mildly affected, axial and predominantly distal in moderately affected, and generalized in severely affected patients. The electromyogram showed signs of myopathy in 10 patients. Muscle biopsy specimens showed myopathic changes, rimmed vacuoles, and accumulation of desmin, dystrophin, and other proteins. Electron microscopy revealed granulofilamentous changes and disorganization of myofibrils. Several patients had episodes of chest pain or palpitations. Three men had arrhythmogenic right ventribular cardiomyopathy. Nonsustained ventribular tachycardia, atrial flutter, and dilatation of the ventricles mainly affecting the right ventricle were documented. Two of them had a pacemaker implanted because of atrioventricular block and sick sinus syndrome. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable onset and severity of skeletal muscle and cardiac involvement. Linkage analysis of candidate chromosomal regions showed a maximum 2-point LOD score of 2.76 for marker locus D10S1752 on chromosome 10q. A multipoint peak LOD score of 3.06 between markers D10S605 and D10S215 suggests linkage to chromosome 10q22.3, and this region may harbor a genetic defect for myofibrillar myopathy with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopahty.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
8872479,Localization of a gene for Möbius syndrome to chromosome 3q by linkage analysis in a Dutch family.,"Möbius syndrome (MIM no. 157900) consists of a congenital paresis or paralysis of the VIIth cranial nerve, frequently accompanied by paralysis of other cranial nerves, orofacial and limb malformations, defects of the musculoskeletal system and mental retardation. Although most patients are sporadic cases, familial recurrence is not rare. Different pedigrees suggest different modes of inheritance. We performed linkage analysis in a large family with autosomal dominantly inherited Möbius syndrome, consisting essentially of asymmetric bilateral facial pareses. After exclusion of the candidate region for Möbius syndrome on 13q12.2-q13, we localized the gene to chromosome 3q21-22, indicating genetic heterogeneity of Möbius syndrome. This heterogeneity is further proven by the exclusion of both loci in a second family with Möbius syndrome.",journal article
12445216,"A missense mutation in CDH3, encoding P-cadherin, causes hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy.","Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early hair loss heralding severe degenerative changes of the retinal macula and culminating in blindness during the second to third decade of life. Recently, we identified a frameshift mutation in the CDH3 gene encoding P-cadherin as the proximal cause of hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy in four families. We report here another consanguineous family in which four members were diagnosed with hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy. Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed in all patients morphologic hair shaft abnormalities consistent with pili torti. Ocular fundus examination disclosed marked degeneration of the macular pigment epithelium. Electrophysiologic studies were diagnostic for severe retinal dysfunction. DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding sequence of CDH3 revealed in all affected individuals a homozygous missense mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution at position 503 of P-cadherin sequence (R503H). The mutation completely segregated with the hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy phenotype in the family but was not detectable in 83 healthy, unrelated controls. The amino acid substitution affects a highly conserved residue and is predicted to alter a Ca2+ binding domain of P-cadherin. This is the first pathogenic missense mutation reported in CDH3 and the second mutation found to underlie hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy. Our data establish recessive mutations in CDH3 as the molecular cause of hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy and expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of this intriguing disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

We used homozygosity mapping in four consanguineous families to localize the gene defective in HJMD to 16q22.1. This region contains CDH3, encoding P-cadherin, which is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and hair follicles.

These results establish the molecular etiology of HJMD and implicate for the first time a cadherin molecule in the pathogenesis of a human hair and retinal disorder.",journal article
8874445,Autosomal-dominant anomalies of the iris pigment epithelium.,"PURPOSE:The authors document two families in which anomalies of the iris pigment epithelium occur as an autosomal dominant trait. METHODS:Eyes of members of two families were examined for the presence of anomalies of the iris pigment epithelium. RESULTS:In both families, anomalies characterized by iris pigment epithelial cysts and peripupillary ruffles were observed in successive generations. In one family, the proband was 3 months of age, and both cysts and ruffles were present in affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS:Anomalies of the iris pigment epithelium can be inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern. The cystic and ruffled phenotypes represent variable expressivity and may be evident in infancy.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
12872269,Polymorphisms in fatty acid-binding protein-3 (FABP3) - putative association with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) play key roles as transport vehicles of fatty compounds throughout the cytoplasm. Human FABP3, one of the FABPs, is present in a wide variety of tissues with highest concentration in cardiac and skeletal muscle. In an effort to identify polymorphic markers in potential candidate genes for type 2 diabetes, we have sequenced the full gene of FABP3, including the -1,500bp promoter region. Fourteen polymorphisms were identified in FABP3: two ins/dels, two STRs, and ten SNPs (two in promoter, nine in intron, two in 3'UTR, and one in the 3' end). Among identified polymorphisms, five common sites including c.-530_-532delCTC, c.-345T>C, c.348+429(CA)9-18, c.246+1806G>C, and c.634+483delT were genotyped in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal control (n=669). By logistic and multiple regression analysis, one insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 3' end (c.634+483delT) of FABP3 appeared to be weakly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (OR=1.78-1.94, P=0.03-0.04) and waist/hip ratio (WHR) (P=0.03).",journal article
9070931,A new locus for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP19) maps to 1p13-1p21.,"Autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) is characterized by considerable allelic and nonallelic heterogeneity. Mutations have been described in the rhodopsin gene (RHO), the genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits of rod phosphodiesterase (PDEA and PDEB), and the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the cGMP-gated channel (CNCG). In addition, linkage studies in single extended pedigrees have defined two new arRP loci, at 1q and 6p. To identify the disease gene in a Spanish consanguineous arRP family, a linkage analysis was undertaken. After testing 102 polymorphic markers, a significant positive lod score (Zmax = 3.64 at theta = 0) was obtained with marker D1S188 at 1p13-p21, the same region where the Stargardt and fundus flavimaculatus (FFM) loci were previously defined. Exhaustive ophthalmologic examination of the patients clearly distinguished the disease from the Stargardt and FFM phenotypes and revealed an atypical form of arRP with choroidal atrophy as a distinctive feature.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
21326233,Gipc3 mutations associated with audiogenic seizures and sensorineural hearing loss in mouse and human.,"Sensorineural hearing loss affects the quality of life and communication of millions of people, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identify mutations in Gipc3 underlying progressive sensorineural hearing loss (age-related hearing loss 5, ahl5) and audiogenic seizures (juvenile audiogenic monogenic seizure 1, jams1) in mice and autosomal recessive deafness DFNB15 and DFNB95 in humans. Gipc3 localizes to inner ear sensory hair cells and spiral ganglion. A missense mutation in the PDZ domain has an attenuating effect on mechanotransduction and the acquisition of mature inner hair cell potassium currents. Magnitude and temporal progression of wave I amplitude of afferent neurons correlate with susceptibility and resistance to audiogenic seizures. The Gipc3(343A) allele disrupts the structure of the stereocilia bundle and affects long-term function of auditory hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. Our study suggests a pivotal role of Gipc3 in acoustic signal acquisition and propagation in cochlear hair cells.",chapter-article; journal article
14764528,"Familial essential thrombocythemia associated with a dominant-positive activating mutation of the c-MPL gene, which encodes for the receptor for thrombopoietin.","One Japanese pedigree of familial essential thrombocythemia (FET) inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner is presented. A unique point mutation, serine 505 to asparagine 505 (Ser505Asn), was identified in the transmembrane domain of the c-MPL gene in all of the 8 members with thrombocythemia, but in none of the other 8 unaffected members in this FET family. The Ba/F3 cells expressing the mutant Asn505 acquired interleukin 3 (IL-3)-independent survival capacity, whereas those expressing wild-type Ser505 did not. The autonomous phosphorylation of Mek1/2 and Stat5b was observed in the mutant Ba/F3 cells in the absence of IL-3. The former was also found in platelets derived from the affected individual in the absence of thrombopoietin. These results show that the Asn505 is an activating mutation with respect to the intracellular signaling and survival of the cells. This is the first report of FET deriving from a dominant-positive activating mutation of the c-MPL gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16868251,MPL515 mutations in myeloproliferative and other myeloid disorders: a study of 1182 patients.,"Recently, a gain-of-function MPL mutation, MPLW515L, was described in patients with JAK2V617F-negative myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). To gain more information on mutational frequency, disease specificity, and clinical correlates, genomic DNA from 1182 patients with myeloproliferative and other myeloid disorders and 64 healthy controls was screened for MPL515 mutations, regardless of JAK2V617F mutational status: 290 with MMM, 242 with polycythemia vera, 318 with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 88 with myelodysplastic syndrome, 118 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and 126 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MPL515 mutations, either MPLW515L (n = 17) or a previously undescribed MPLW515K (n = 5), were detected in 20 patients. The diagnosis of patients with mutant MPL alleles at the time of molecular testing was de novo MMM in 12 patients, ET in 4, post-ET MMM in 1, and MMM in blast crisis in 3. Six patients carried the MPLW515L and JAK2V617F alleles concurrently. We conclude that MPLW515L or MPLW515K mutations are present in patients with MMM or ET at a frequency of approximately 5% and 1%, respectively, but are not observed in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) or other myeloid disorders. Furthermore, MPL mutations may occur concurrently with the JAK2V617F mutation, suggesting that these alleles may have functional complementation in myeloproliferative disease.",review-article; review; journal article
12107438,Nonsyndromic recessive deafness DFNB18 and Usher syndrome type IC are allelic mutations of USHIC.,"Human chromosome 11 harbors two Usher type I loci, USHIB and USHIC, which encode myosin VIIA and harmonin, respectively. The USHIC locus overlaps the reported critical interval for nonsyndromic deafness locus DFNB18. We found an IVS12+5G-->C mutation in the USHIC gene, which is associated with nonsyndromic recessive deafness ( DFNB18) segregating in the original family, S-11/12. No other disease-associated mutation was found in the other 27 exons or in the intron-exon boundaries, and the IVS12+5G-->C mutation was not present in 200 representative unaffected individuals ascertained from the same area of India. An exon-trapping assay with a construct harboring IVS12+5G-->C generated wildtype spliced mRNA having exons 11 and 12 and mRNA that skipped exon 12. We conclude that mutations of USHIC can cause both Usher syndrome type IC and nonsyndromic recessive deafness DFNB18.","comparative study; research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
26769062,A specific mutation in TBL1XR1 causes Pierpont syndrome.,"BACKGROUND:The combination of developmental delay, facial characteristics, hearing loss and abnormal fat distribution in the distal limbs is known as Pierpont syndrome. The aim of the present study was to detect and study the cause of Pierpont syndrome. METHODS:We used whole-exome sequencing to analyse four unrelated individuals with Pierpont syndrome, and Sanger sequencing in two other unrelated affected individuals. Expression of mRNA of the wild-type candidate gene was analysed in human postmortem brain specimens, adipose tissue, muscle and liver. Expression of RNA in lymphocytes in patients and controls was additionally analysed. The variant protein was expressed in, and purified from, HEK293 cells to assess its effect on protein folding and function. RESULTS:We identified a single heterozygous missense variant, c.1337A>G (p.Tyr446Cys), in transducin Î²-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1) as disease-causing in all patients. TBL1XR1 mRNA expression was demonstrated in pituitary, hypothalamus, white and brown adipose tissue, muscle and liver. mRNA expression is lower in lymphocytes of two patients compared with the four controls. The mutant TBL1XR1 protein assembled correctly into the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR)/ silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT) complex, suggesting a dominant-negative mechanism. This contrasts with loss-of-function germline TBL1XR1 deletions and other TBL1XR1 mutations that have been implicated in autism. However, autism is not present in individuals with Pierpont syndrome. CONCLUSIONS:This study identifies a specific TBL1XR1 mutation as the cause of Pierpont syndrome. Deletions and other mutations in TBL1XR1 can cause autism. The marked differences between Pierpont patients with the p.Tyr446Cys mutation and individuals with other mutations and whole gene deletions indicate a specific, but as yet unknown, disease mechanism of the TBL1XR1 p.Tyr446Cys mutation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

There are only three patients with Pierpont syndrome who have previously been published in the literature. Details of a series of patients with features of this condition were therefore obtained retrospectively to better characterize its key features. These patients were noted to have distinctive shared facial characteristics, in addition to plantar fat pads and other limb abnormalities. Further individuals with equally striking hand and foot findings were identified whose facies were less characteristic, and hence we considered them unlikely to be affected with the same condition. Despite several patients with possible Pierpont syndrome having had high-resolution array CGH or SNP array, the etiology of this phenotype remains unknown. Whilst it is as yet unclear whether it is a single entity, there appears to be a group of patients in whom Pierpont syndrome may be a recognizable condition, with typical facies, particularly when smiling, and characteristic hand and foot findings.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30365874,TBL1XR1 mutations in Pierpont syndrome are not restricted to the recurrent p.Tyr446Cys mutation.,"Pierpont syndrome is a rare and sporadic syndrome, including developmental delay, facial characteristics, and abnormal extremities. Recently, a recurrent de novo TBL1XR1 variant (c.1337A > G; p.Tyr446Cys) has been identified in eight patients by whole-exome sequencing. A dominant-negative effect of this mutation is strongly suspected, since patients with TBL1XR1 deletion and other variants predicting loss of function do not share the same phenotype. We report two patients with typical Pierpont-like syndrome features. Exome sequencing allowed identifying a de novo heterozygous missense TBL1XR1 variant in both patients, different from those already reported: p.Cys325Tyr and p.Tyr446His. The localization of these mutations and clinical features of Pierpont-like syndrome suggest that their functional consequences are comparable with the recurrent mutation previously described, and provided additional data to understand molecular mechanisms of TBL1XR1 anomalies.",review; journal article; case reports
23684011,FAM111A mutations result in hypoparathyroidism and impaired skeletal development.,"Kenny-Caffey syndrome (KCS) and the similar but more severe osteocraniostenosis (OCS) are genetic conditions characterized by impaired skeletal development with small and dense bones, short stature, and primary hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcemia. We studied five individuals with KCS and five with OCS and found that all of them had heterozygous mutations in FAM111A. One mutation was identified in four unrelated individuals with KCS, and another one was identified in two unrelated individuals with OCS; all occurred de novo. Thus, OCS and KCS are allelic disorders of different severity. FAM111A codes for a 611 amino acid protein with homology to trypsin-like peptidases. Although FAM111A has been found to bind to the large T-antigen of SV40 and restrict viral replication, its native function is unknown. Molecular modeling of FAM111A shows that residues affected by KCS and OCS mutations do not map close to the active site but are clustered on a segment of the protein and are at, or close to, its outer surface, suggesting that the pathogenesis involves the interaction with as yet unidentified partner proteins rather than impaired catalysis. FAM111A appears to be crucial to a pathway that governs parathyroid hormone production, calcium homeostasis, and skeletal development and growth.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

We sequenced this gene in members of 2 previously reported kinships that manifest typical juvenile hemochromatosis. In one kinship, 2 previously undescribed mutations of HJV were identified, c.238T>C (C80R) and c.302T>C (L101P). In the second kinship, 2 previously identified mutations, G320V and I222N, were found.

11519011,"Mutations in the 3beta-hydroxysterol Delta24-reductase gene cause desmosterolosis, an autosomal recessive disorder of cholesterol biosynthesis.","Desmosterolosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by multiple congenital anomalies. Patients with desmosterolosis have elevated levels of the cholesterol precursor desmosterol, in plasma, tissue, and cultured cells; this abnormality suggests a deficiency of the enzyme 3beta-hydroxysterol Delta24-reductase (DHCR24), which, in cholesterol biosynthesis, catalyzes the reduction of the Delta24 double bond of sterol intermediates. We identified the human DHCR24 cDNA, by the similarity between the encoded protein and a recently characterized plant enzyme--DWF1/DIM, from Arabidopsis thaliana--catalyzing a different but partially similar reaction in steroid/sterol biosynthesis in plants. Heterologous expression, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, of the DHCR24 cDNA, followed by enzyme-activity measurements, confirmed that it encodes DHCR24. The encoded DHCR24 protein has a calculated molecular weight of 60.1 kD, contains a potential N-terminal secretory-signal sequence as well as at least one putative transmembrane helix, and is a member of a recently defined family of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductases. Conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol by DHCR24 in vitro is strictly dependent on reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and is increased twofold by the addition of FAD to the assay. The corresponding gene, DHCR24, was identified by database searching, spans approximately 46.4 kb, is localized to chromosome 1p31.1-p33, and comprises nine exons and eight introns. Sequence analysis of DHCR24 in two patients with desmosterolosis revealed four different missense mutations, which were shown, by functional expression, in yeast, of the patient alleles, to be disease causing. Our data demonstrate that desmosterolosis is a cholesterol-biosynthesis disorder caused by mutations in DHCR24.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
12457401,Desmosterolosis presenting with multiple congenital anomalies and profound developmental delay.,"Desmosterol (cholesta-5,24-dien-3beta-ol) is a minor sterol that forms as an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway when the 24-unsaturated sterol bond is reduced as the last step rather than earlier in the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol. In 1998, FitzPatrick et al. reported a premature infant who died shortly after birth and had marked tissue elevations of desmosterol and a strikingly abnormal phenotype. We describe here the first living patient with desmosterolosis and show biochemical evidence in plasma and cultured lymphoblasts for an autosomal recessive deficiency of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24). The infant has severe microcephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, downslanting palpebral fissures, micrognathia, submucous cleft palate, clubfoot, and a persistent patent ductus arteriosus. Plasma sterol quantification in the patient at age 2 years demonstrated a normal cholesterol level, but a 100-fold increased level of desmosterol (60 mcg/ml; nl 0.5 +/- 0.3 mcg/ml (SD)) suggesting deficient activity of 24-dehydrocholesterol (desmosterol) reductase (DHCR24). Both parents had mildly increased levels of desmosterol in plasma (mother: 1.4 mcg/ml; father: 1.8 mcg/ml), consistent with heterozygosity for DHCR24 deficiency. Analysis of sterol metabolism in cultured transformed lymphoblasts showed a 100-fold increased level of desmosterol and a moderately decreased level of cholesterol in the patient's cells and a 10-fold elevation of desmosterol in the mother's cells. At the age of 3.5 years, the patient stands but does not walk, uses a 5-word vocabulary, and lacks any major medical problems.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated an abnormal accumulation of desmosterol in kidney, liver. and brain. Higher than normal levels of the same sterol were detected in plasma samples obtained from both parents. The biochemical phenotype in this infant is highly suggestive of a novel inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of 3betahydroxysterol-delta24-reductase. A phenotypic overlap of this case with Raine syndrome was noted; however, desmosterol accumulation was not found on postmortem tissue samples from a previously reported case of this disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
18445049,Autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis syndrome: further delineation of the phenotype.,"Autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis (ARIH) syndrome, which is characterized by congenital ichthyosis, abnormal hair and corneal involvement, has recently been shown in one consanguineous Israeli Arab family to be caused by a mutation in the ST14 gene, which encodes serine protease matriptase. No other families have so far been described since the original report. In this current report we describe a female patient from a second family with ARIH syndrome who carries a homozygous novel mutation, p.M1I. The patient has congenital ichthyosis, light brown, curly, sparse hair, improving with age, and sparse body hair, eyebrows and eyelashes. She does not suffer from photophobia, but has blepharitis. The phenotype of this patient closely resembles that of the affected individuals in the previously reported family, although she does not have tooth abnormalities and the ichthyosis is milder.",journal article; case reports
17273967,"Autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis caused by a mutation in ST14, encoding type II transmembrane serine protease matriptase.","In this article, we describe a novel autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis syndrome, characterized by congenital ichthyosis associated with abnormal hair. Using homozygosity mapping, we mapped the disease locus to 11q24.3-q25. We screened the ST14 gene, which encodes matriptase, since transplantation of skin from matriptase(-/-)-knockout mice onto adult athymic nude mice has been shown elsewhere to result in an ichthyosislike phenotype associated with almost complete absence of erupted pelage hairs. Mutation analysis revealed a missense mutation, G827R, in the highly conserved peptidase S1-S6 domain. Marked skin hyperkeratosis due to impaired degradation of the stratum corneum corneodesmosomes was observed in the affected individuals, which suggests that matriptase plays a significant role in epidermal desquamation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
16114046,Auriculo-condylar syndrome is associated with highly variable ear and mandibular defects in multiple kindreds.,"We report on 20 individuals in 4 kindreds with auriculo-condylar syndrome (ACS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by congenital auricular clefts, mandibular condyle hypoplasia, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) abnormalities, micrognathia, microstomia, and a round facial appearance with prominent cheeks. Affected individuals have varying degrees of glossoptosis, respiratory distress, masticatory abnormalities, and malocclusion. Data from these families and those previously described suggest that this is a unique disorder with widely variable expression, including lack of obvious external anomalies in some individuals and severe ear malformations, condyle agenesis, and characteristic facial features in others. Early recognition of this condition should permit appropriate counseling and anticipatory guidance, including evaluation for reconstructive surgery and orthodontia and intervention for upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea.",review; journal article; case reports
12414817,Novel ATP6V1B1 and ATP6V0A4 mutations in autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis with new evidence for hearing loss.,"Autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis (rdRTA) is characterised by severe hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis in childhood, hypokalaemia, decreased urinary calcium solubility, and impaired bone physiology and growth. Two types of rdRTA have been differentiated by the presence or absence of sensorineural hearing loss, but appear otherwise clinically similar. Recently, we identified mutations in genes encoding two different subunits of the renal alpha-intercalated cell's apical H(+)-ATPase that cause rdRTA. Defects in the B1 subunit gene ATP6V1B1, and the a4 subunit gene ATP6V0A4, cause rdRTA with deafness and with preserved hearing, respectively. We have investigated 26 new rdRTA kindreds, of which 23 are consanguineous. Linkage analysis of seven novel SNPs and five polymorphic markers in, and tightly linked to, ATP6V1B1 and ATP6V0A4 suggested that four families do not link to either locus, providing strong evidence for additional genetic heterogeneity. In ATP6V1B1, one novel and five previously reported mutations were found in 10 kindreds. In 12 ATP6V0A4 kindreds, seven of 10 mutations were novel. A further nine novel ATP6V0A4 mutations were found in ""sporadic"" cases. The previously reported association between ATP6V1B1 defects and severe hearing loss in childhood was maintained. However, several patients with ATP6V0A4 mutations have developed hearing loss, usually in young adulthood. We show here that ATP6V0A4 is expressed within the human inner ear. These findings provide further evidence for genetic heterogeneity in rdRTA, extend the spectrum of disease causing mutations in ATP6V1B1 and ATP6V0A4, and show ATP6V0A4 expression within the cochlea for the first time.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
18976725,Identification of a 2 Mb human ortholog of Drosophila eyes shut/spacemaker that is mutated in patients with retinitis pigmentosa.,"In patients with autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP), homozygosity mapping was performed for detection of regions harboring genes that might be causative for RP. In one affected sib pair, a shared homozygous region of 5.0 Mb was identified on chromosome 6, within the RP25 locus. One of the genes residing in this interval was the retina-expressed gene EGFL11. Several genes resembling EGFL11 were predicted just centromeric of EGFL11. Extensive long-range RT-PCR, combined with 5'- and 3'- RACE analysis, resulted in the identification of a 10-kb transcript, starting with the annotated exons of EGFL11 and spanning 44 exons and 2 Mb of genomic DNA. The transcript is predicted to encode a 3165-aa extracellular protein containing 28 EGF-like and five laminin A G-like domains. Interestingly, the second part of the protein was found to be the human ortholog of Drosophila eyes shut (eys), also known as spacemaker, a protein essential for photoreceptor morphology. Mutation analysis in the sib pair homozygous at RP25 revealed a nonsense mutation (p.Tyr3156X) segregating with RP. The same mutation was identified homozygously in three arRP siblings of an unrelated family. A frame-shift mutation (pPro2238ProfsX16) was found in an isolated RP patient. In conclusion, we identified a gene, coined eyes shut homolog (EYS), consisting of EGFL11 and the human ortholog of Drosophila eys, which is mutated in patients with arRP. With a size of 2 Mb, it is one of the largest human genes, and it is by far the largest retinal dystrophy gene. The discovery of EYS might shed light on a critical component of photoreceptor morphogenesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26740388,Muenke syndrome: An international multicenter natural history study.,"Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal, and calcaneal fusions, and behavioral differences. Reduced penetrance and variable expressivity contribute to the wide spectrum of clinical findings. Muenke syndrome constitutes the most common syndromic form of craniosynostosis, with an incidence of 1 in 30,000 births and is defined by the presence of the p.Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3. Participants were recruited from international craniofacial surgery and genetic clinics. Affected individuals, parents, and their siblings, if available, were enrolled in the study if they had a p.Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3. One hundred and six patients from 71 families participated in this study. In 51 informative probands, 33 cases (64.7%) were inherited. Eighty-five percent of the participants had craniosynostosis (16 of 103 did not have craniosynostosis), with 47.5% having bilateral and 28.2% with unilateral synostosis. Females and males were similarly affected with bicoronal craniosynostosis, 50% versus 44.4% (P = 0.84), respectively. Clefting was rare (1.1%). Hearing loss was identified in 70.8%, developmental delay in 66.3%, intellectual disability in 35.6%, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in 23.7%, and seizures in 20.2%. In patients with complete skeletal surveys (upper and lower extremity x-rays), 75% of individuals were found to have at least a single abnormal radiographical finding in addition to skull findings. This is the largest study of the natural history of Muenke syndrome, adding valuable clinical information to the care of these individuals including behavioral and cognitive impairment data, vision changes, and hearing loss.",multicenter study; journal article
20301588,Muenke Syndrome,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Muenke syndrome is defined by the presence of the specific FGFR3 pathogenic variant – c.749C>G – that results in the protein change p.Pro250Arg. Muenke syndrome is characterized by considerable phenotypic variability: features may include coronal synostosis (more often bilateral than unilateral); synostosis of other sutures, all sutures (pan synostosis), or no sutures; or macrocephaly. Bilateral coronal synostosis typically results in brachycephaly (reduced anteroposterior dimension of the skull), although turribrachycephaly (a ""tower-shaped"" skull) or a cloverleaf skull can be observed. Unilateral coronal synostosis results in anterior plagiocephaly (asymmetry of the skull and face). Other craniofacial findings typically include: temporal bossing; widely spaced eyes, ptosis or proptosis (usually mild); midface retrusion (usually mild); and highly arched palate or cleft lip and palate. Strabismus is common. Other findings can include: hearing loss (in 33%-100% of affected individuals); developmental delay (~33%); epilepsy; intracranial anomalies; intellectual disability; carpal bone and/or tarsal bone fusions; brachydactyly, broad toes, broad thumbs, and/or clinodactyly; and radiographic findings of thimble-like (short and broad) middle phalanges and/or cone-shaped epiphyses. Phenotypic variability is considerable even within the same family. Of note, some individuals who have the p.Pro250Arg pathogenic variant may have no signs of Muenke syndrome on physical or radiographic examination. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of Muenke syndrome is established by the identification of the FGFR3 pathogenic variant c.749C>G (p.Pro250Arg). MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Children with Muenke syndrome and craniosynostosis are best managed by a pediatric craniofacial clinic that typically includes a craniofacial surgeon and neurosurgeon, clinical geneticist, ophthalmologist, otolaryngologist, pediatrician, radiologist, psychologist, dentist, audiologist, speech therapist, and social worker. Depending on severity, the first craniosynostosis repair (fronto-orbital advancement and cranial vault remodeling) is typically performed between ages three and six months. An alternative approach is endoscopic strip craniectomy, which is a less invasive procedure and is typically performed prior to age three months. Postoperative increased intracranial pressure and/or the need for secondary or tertiary extracranial contouring may occur. The need for secondary revision procedures is inversely related to the age of the affected individual at the time of initial repair. The location of the fused/synostotic suture, type of fixation, and the use of bone grafting do not have a significant effect on the need for revision. Standard treatments for sensorineural hearing loss; early speech therapy and intervention programs for those with developmental delay, intellectual impairment, behavioral problems, and/or hearing loss; surgical correction for strabismus; lubrication for exposure keratopathy. Prevention of secondary complications: Early surgical reconstruction for craniosynostosis may reduce the risk for complications including sequelae related to increased intracranial pressure (e.g., behavioral changes). Surveillance: Affected individuals benefit from integrated multidisciplinary care and protocol-driven management from birth to maturity that includes: annual multidisciplinary reviews and periodic review by a social work team; regular developmental assessments; periodic repeat audiograms to screen for acquired or progressive hearing loss; periodic assessment for strabismus. GENETIC COUNSELING:Muenke syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. If the defining FGFR3 pathogenic variant cannot be detected in either parent of a proband, germline mosaicism in a parent or a de novo pathogenic variant in the proband are possible. Each child of an individual with Muenke syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. Prenatal ultrasound examination may be used as an adjunct to prenatal genetic testing.",book; review
15013873,The epidemiology of age-related macular degeneration.,"PURPOSE: To review the epidemiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Evidence from epidemiologic data regarding the natural history of AMD and its risk factors are presented. RESULTS: Large, soft drusen associated with pigmentary abnormalities increase the risk of progression to advanced AMD. Large soft drusen may fade over time. Advanced AMD is more likely to be present in whites than blacks, despite the similar prevalence of soft drusen in both groups. Neovascular AMD is more frequent than geographic atrophy in most population-based studies in whites in America, Australia, and the Netherlands than in similar population-based studies in Iceland and Norway. After age and family history, there are few consistent relationships of risk factors to AMD. Of these, the relationship of smoking, hypertension, and cataract surgery to advanced AMD have been most consistent. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term epidemiologic studies have provided information on the distribution and the natural history of AMD and its associated risk factors. It is not known what effect reduction of blood pressure and the cessation of smoking might have on the incidence and progression of AMD.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; review; journal article"

20512146,"Mutations in TMEM216 perturb ciliogenesis and cause Joubert, Meckel and related syndromes.","Joubert syndrome (JBTS), related disorders (JSRDs) and Meckel syndrome (MKS) are ciliopathies. We now report that MKS2 and CORS2 (JBTS2) loci are allelic and caused by mutations in TMEM216, which encodes an uncharacterized tetraspan transmembrane protein. Individuals with CORS2 frequently had nephronophthisis and polydactyly, and two affected individuals conformed to the oro-facio-digital type VI phenotype, whereas skeletal dysplasia was common in fetuses affected by MKS. A single G218T mutation (R73L in the protein) was identified in all cases of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (n=10). TMEM216 localized to the base of primary cilia, and loss of TMEM216 in mutant fibroblasts or after knockdown caused defective ciliogenesis and centrosomal docking, with concomitant hyperactivation of RhoA and Dishevelled. TMEM216 formed a complex with Meckelin, which is encoded by a gene also mutated in JSRDs and MKS. Disruption of tmem216 expression in zebrafish caused gastrulation defects similar to those in other ciliary morphants. These data implicate a new family of proteins in the ciliopathies and further support allelism between ciliopathy disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
12215968,"GRACILE syndrome, a lethal metabolic disorder with iron overload, is caused by a point mutation in BCS1L.","GRACILE (growth retardation, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, iron overload, lactacidosis, and early death) syndrome is a recessively inherited lethal disease characterized by fetal growth retardation, lactic acidosis, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, and abnormalities in iron metabolism. We previously localized the causative gene to a 1.5-cM region on chromosome 2q33-37. In the present study, we report the molecular defect causing this metabolic disorder, by identifying a homozygous missense mutation that results in an S78G amino acid change in the BCS1L gene in Finnish patients with GRACILE syndrome, as well as five different mutations in three British infants. BCS1L, a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, is a chaperone necessary for the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. Pulse-chase experiments performed in COS-1 cells indicated that the S78G amino acid change results in instability of the polypeptide, and yeast complementation studies revealed a functional defect in the mutated BCS1L protein. Four different mutations in the BCS1L gene have been reported elsewhere, in Turkish patients with a distinctly different phenotype. Interestingly, the British and Turkish patients had complex III deficiency, whereas in the Finnish patients with GRACILE syndrome complex III activity was within the normal range, implying that BCS1L has another cellular function that is uncharacterized but essential and is putatively involved in iron metabolism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
22156576,Variants in ASB10 are associated with open-angle glaucoma.,"The molecular events responsible for obstruction of aqueous humor outflow and the loss of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma, one of the main causes of blindness worldwide, remain poorly understood. We identified a synonymous variant, c.765C>T (Thr255Thr), in ankyrin repeats and suppressor of cytokine signaling box-containing protein 10 (ASB10) in a large family with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) mapping to the GLC1F locus. This variant affects an exon splice enhancer site and alters mRNA splicing in lymphoblasts of affected family members. Systematic sequence analysis in two POAG patient groups (195 US and 977 German) and their respective controls (85 and 376) lead to the identification of 26 amino acid changes in 70 patients (70 of 1172; 6.0%) compared with 9 in 13 controls (13 of 461; 2.8%; P = 0.008). Molecular modeling suggests that these missense variants change ASB10 net charge or destabilize ankyrin repeats. ASB10 mRNA and protein were found to be strongly expressed in trabecular meshwork, retinal ganglion cells and ciliary body. Silencing of ASB10 transcripts in perfused anterior segment organ culture reduced outflow facility by ∼50% compared with control-infected anterior segments (P = 0.02). In conclusion, genetic and molecular analyses provide evidence for ASB10 as a glaucoma-causing gene.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
10037570,"GLC1F, a new primary open-angle glaucoma locus, maps to 7q35-q36.","BACKGROUND:A large family with adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) was identified. OBJECTIVE:To initiate a genome-wide scan to map the POAG locus in this family. METHODS:Blood samples or buccal swabs were obtained from 25 members of a large family with POAG after informed consent was obtained. Members and their spouses were evaluated clinically for POAG on the basis of intraocular pressures, cupping of discs, and visual fields. DNA samples were used for a genome-wide screen using microsatellite markers. RESULTS:Ten affected family members in 4 generations showed evidence of POAG including intraocular pressures of 22 mm Hg or more, and/or optic cup-disc ratios of 0.6 or more, and/or visual field defects consistent with glaucomatous damage. Primary open-angle glaucoma segregated as an autosomal dominant trait, with the disease locus mapping to 7q35-q36 between markers D7S2442 and D7S483 with a multipoint lod score of 4.06. CONCLUSION:A sixth gene for POAG (GLC1F) has been mapped to 7q35-q36 in a family with at least 4 generations affected. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:The mapping of this locus further confirms that primary open-angle glaucoma is a heterogeneous group of diseases with at least 6 different loci resulting in a similar phenotype. The eventual ability to classify which major POAG gene an affected person carries could have ramifications for selecting the most effective treatment regimen for that person.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Up to know, different genes involved in the DNA repair pathway, mainly FANCA genes, have been identified to be affected in patients with FA. CASE PRESENTATION:Here, we report clinical, laboratory and genetic findings in a 3.5-year-old Iranian female patient, a product of a consanguineous marriage, who was suspicious of FA, observed with short stature, microcephaly, skin hyperpigmentation, anemia, thrombocytopenia and hypo cellular bone marrow. Therefore, Next Generation Sequencing was performed to identify the genetic cause of the disease in this patient. Results revealed a novel, private, homozygous frameshift mutation in the FANCF gene (NM_022725: c. 534delG, p. G178â€‰fs) which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the proband. CONCLUSION:Such studies may help uncover the exact pathomechanisms of this disorder and establish the genotype-phenotype correlations by identification of more mutations in this gene. It is the first report of a mutation in the FANCF gene in Iranian patients with Fanconi anemia.

27797808,Clinicopathological features of adult-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease.,"Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the central and peripheral nervous system, and also in the visceral organs. NIID has been considered to be a heterogeneous disease because of the highly variable clinical manifestations, and ante-mortem diagnosis has been difficult. However, since we reported the usefulness of skin biopsy for the diagnosis of NIID, the number of NIID diagnoses has increased, in particular adult-onset NIID. In this study, we studied 57 cases of adult-onset NIID and described their clinical and pathological features. We analysed both NIID cases diagnosed by post-mortem dissection and by ante-mortem skin biopsy based on the presence of characteristic eosinophilic, hyaline and ubiquitin-positive intanuclear inclusion: 38 sporadic cases and 19 familial cases, from six families. In the sporadic NIID cases with onset age from 51 to 76, dementia was the most prominent initial symptom (94.7%) as designated 'dementia dominant group', followed by miosis, ataxia and unconsciousness. Muscle weakness and sensory disturbance were also observed. It was observed that, in familial NIID cases with onset age less than 40 years, muscle weakness was seen most frequently (100%), as designated 'limb weakness group', followed by sensory disturbance, miosis, bladder dysfunction, and dementia. In familial cases with more than 40 years of onset age, dementia was most prominent (100%). Elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and abnormal nerve conduction were frequently observed in both sporadic and familial NIID cases. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed high intensity signal in corticomedullary junction in diffusion-weighted image in both sporadic and familial NIID cases, a strong clue to the diagnosis. All of the dementia dominant cases presented with this type of leukoencephalopathy on head magnetic resonance imaging. Both sporadic and familial NIID cases presented with a decline in Mini-Mental State Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery scores. Based on these clinicopathological features, we proposed a diagnosis flow chart of adult-onset NIID. Our study suggested that the prevalence rate of adult-onset NIID may be higher than previously thought, and that NIID may be underdiagnosed. We should take NIID into account for differential diagnosis of leukoencephalopathy and neuropathy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

METHODS: Mutational analysis of STX11 by direct sequencing was done in 28 FHL families that did not harbour perforin mutations, previously identified in some FHL patients. A detailed investigation of clinical features of these patients was also undertaken. RESULTS: Two different STX11 mutations were identified, one nonsense mutation and one deletion, affecting six of 34 children in four of 28 unrelated PRF1 negative families. Both mutations have been reported before. Three patients experienced long periods (> or = 1 year) in remission without specific treatment, which is very uncommon in this disease. Despite the milder phenotype, some children with STX11 mutations developed severe psychomotor retardation. Two of the six patients harbouring STX11 gene defects developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). CONCLUSIONS: STX11 gene mutations were found in 14% of the PRF1 negative FHL families included in the present cohort. These results suggest that STX11 gene mutations may be associated with secondary malignancies (MDS/AML), and that there is segregation of specific clinical features in FHL patients with an underlying genotype.","letter; research support, non-u.s. gov't; case-report"

His clinical course included repeated hemorrhagic incidents leading to death at age 37 months. Bone marrow ultrastructural analysis revealed numerous dystrophic megakaryocytes with giant membrane complexes. Although these features were similar to those described for megakaryocytes in mice lacking the gene for transcription factor p45-NF-E2, no abnormalities in the p45-NF-E2 gene could be documented. Platelet membrane analysis showed a reduction in glycoprotein (GP) Ib, but normal content of GPIIb and GPIIIa. Analysis of genes encoding for GPIb alpha and beta, GPV, and GPIX ruled out the possibility that the observed platelet abnormality is a variant of Bernard-Soulier syndrome. A moderate neutropenia was associated with a complete lack of expression of sialyl-Lewis-X on the surface of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. A common defect in posttranslational modification of glycoproteins could account for the diverse cellular abnormalities.",journal article; case reports
9949200,"An alpha-tectorin gene defect causes a newly identified autosomal recessive form of sensorineural pre-lingual non-syndromic deafness, DFNB21.","In our efforts to identify new loci responsible for non-syndromic autosomal recessive forms of deafness, DFNB loci, we have pursued the analysis of large consanguineous affected families living in geographically isolated areas. Here, we report on the study of a Lebanese family comprising nine members presenting with a pre-lingual severe to profound sensorineural isolated form of deafness. Linkage analysis led to the characterization of a new locus, DFNB21, which was assigned to chromosome 11q23-25. Already mapped to this chromosomal region was TECTA. This gene encodes alpha-tectorin, a 2155 amino acid protein which is a component of the tectorial membrane. This gene recently has been shown to be responsible for a dominant form of deafness, DFNA8/12. Sequence analysis of the TECTA gene in the DFNB21-affected family revealed a G to A transition in the donor splice site (GT) of intron 9, predicted to lead to a truncated protein of 971 amino acids. This establishes that alpha-tectorin mutations can be responsible for both dominant and recessive forms of deafness. Comparison of the phenotype of the DFNB21 heterozygous carriers with that of DFNA8/12-affected individuals supports the hypothesis that the TECTA mutations which cause the dominant form of deafness have a dominant-negative effect. The present results provide genetic evidence for alpha-tectorin forming homo- or heteromeric structures.",research-article; journal article

9887371,"Identification of a locus on chromosome 7q31, DFNB14, responsible for prelingual sensorineural non-syndromic deafness.","In our efforts to identify new loci responsible for non-syndromic autosomal recessive forms of deafness, DFNB loci, we have pursued the analysis of large consanguineous affected families living in geographically isolated areas. Here, we report on the study of a Lebanese family affected with a prelingual profound sensorineural isolated form of deafness. Segregation analysis resulted in a linkage with locus D7S554 to locus D7S2459 on 7q31, with a maximum lod score of 6.3. The causative gene was mapped to a 15 cM interval extending from D7S527 to D7S3074 (on the telomeric side). The distal limit of this interval could be located between D7S496 and D7S3074 which are the closest polymorphic loci flanking the gene underlying Pendred syndrome (PDS) on the centromeric and on the telomeric sides, respectively. To eliminate PDS as a candidate gene, its 21 exons were sequenced. No mutation was detected. This study therefore reports the identification of a novel locus, DFNB14, on chromosome 7q31, in a position proximal to PDS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
11687802,Mutations in a new gene encoding a protein of the hair bundle cause non-syndromic deafness at the DFNB16 locus.,"Hearing impairment affects about 1 in 1,000 children at birth. Approximately 70 loci implicated in non-syndromic forms of deafness have been reported in humans and 24 causative genes have been identified (see also http://www.uia.ac.be/dnalab/hhh). We report a mouse transcript, isolated by a candidate deafness gene approach, that is expressed almost exclusively in the inner ear. Genomic analysis shows that the human ortholog STRC (so called owing to the name we have given its protein-stereocilin), which is located on chromosome 15q15, contains 29 exons encompassing approximately 19 kb. STRC is tandemly duplicated, with the coding sequence of the second copy interrupted by a stop codon in exon 20. We have identified two frameshift mutations and a large deletion in the copy containing 29 coding exons in two families affected by autosomal recessive non-syndromal sensorineural deafness linked to the DFNB16 locus. Stereocilin is made up of 1,809 amino acids, and contains a putative signal petide and several hydrophobic segments. Using immunohistolabeling, we demonstrate that, in the mouse inner ear, stereocilin is expressed only in the sensory hair cells and is associated with the stereocilia, the stiff microvilli forming the structure for mechanoreception of sound stimulation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
12471200,Mutations of the UMOD gene are responsible for medullary cystic kidney disease 2 and familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy.,"INTRODUCTION:Medullary cystic kidney disease 2 (MCKD2) and familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy (FJHN) are both autosomal dominant renal diseases characterised by juvenile onset of hyperuricaemia, gout, and progressive renal failure. Clinical features of both conditions vary in presence and severity. Often definitive diagnosis is possible only after significant pathology has occurred. Genetic linkage studies have localised genes for both conditions to overlapping regions of chromosome 16p11-p13. These clinical and genetic findings suggest that these conditions may be allelic. AIM:To identify the gene and associated mutation(s) responsible for FJHN and MCKD2. METHODS:Two large, multigenerational families segregating FJHN were studied by genetic linkage and haplotype analyses to sublocalise the chromosome 16p FJHN gene locus. To permit refinement of the candidate interval and localisation of candidate genes, an integrated physical and genetic map of the candidate region was developed. DNA sequencing of candidate genes was performed to detect mutations in subjects affected with FJHN (three unrelated families) and MCKD2 (one family). RESULTS:We identified four novel uromodulin (UMOD) gene mutations that segregate with the disease phenotype in three families with FJHN and in one family with MCKD2. CONCLUSION:These data provide the first direct evidence that MCKD2 and FJHN arise from mutation of the UMOD gene and are allelic disorders. UMOD is a GPI anchored glycoprotein and the most abundant protein in normal urine. We postulate that mutation of UMOD disrupts the tertiary structure of UMOD and is responsible for the clinical changes of interstitial renal disease, polyuria, and hyperuricaemia found in MCKD2 and FJHN.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article"
14569098,A cluster of mutations in the UMOD gene causes familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy with abnormal expression of uromodulin.,"Familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy (FJHN [MIM 162000]) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by abnormal tubular handling of urate and late development of chronic interstitial nephritis leading to progressive renal failure. A locus for FJHN was previously identified on chromosome 16p12 close to the MCKD2 locus, which is responsible for a variety of autosomal-dominant medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD2). UMOD, the gene encoding the Tamm-Horsfall/uromodulin protein, maps within the FJHN/MCKD2 critical region. Mutations in UMOD were recently reported in nine families with FJHN/MCKD2 disease. A mutation in UMOD has been identified in 11 FJHN families (10 missense and one in-frame deletion)-10 of which are novel-clustering in the highly conserved exon 4. The consequences of UMOD mutations on uromodulin expression were investigated in urine samples and renal biopsies from nine patients in four families. There was a markedly increased expression of uromodulin in a cluster of tubule profiles, suggesting an accumulation of the protein in tubular cells. Consistent with this observation, urinary excretion of wild-type uromodulin was significantly decreased. The latter findings were not observed in patients with FJHN without UMOD mutations. In conclusion, this study points to a mutation clustering in exon 4 of UMOD as a major genetic defect in FJHN. Mutations in UMOD may critically affect the function of uromodulin, resulting in abnormal accumulation within tubular cells and reduced urinary excretion.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
9888879,Cellular cholesterol transport and efflux in fibroblasts are abnormal in subjects with familial HDL deficiency.,"Familial high density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency (FHD) is a genetic lipoprotein disorder characterized by a severe decrease in the plasma HDL cholesterol (-C) level (less than the fifth percentile). Unlike Tangier disease, FHD is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. FHD subjects have none of the clinical manifestations of Tangier disease (lymphoid tissue infiltration with cholesteryl esters and/or neurological manifestations). Plasmas from FHD subjects contain pre-beta-migrating HDLs but are deficient in alpha-migrating HDLs. We hypothesized that a reduced HDL-C level in FHD is due to abnormal transport of cellular cholesterol to the plasma membrane, resulting in reduced cholesterol efflux onto nascent HDL particles, leading to lipid-depleted HDL particles that are rapidly catabolized. Cellular cholesterol metabolism was investigated in skin fibroblasts from FHD and control subjects. HDL3- and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I-mediated cellular cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine efflux was examined by labeling cells with [3H]cholesterol and [3H]choline, respectively, during growth and cholesterol loading during growth arrest. FHD cells displayed an approximately 25% reduction in HDL3-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux and an approximately 50% to 80% reduction in apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine efflux compared with normal cells. Cellular cholesterol ester levels were decreased when cholesterol-labeled cells were incubated with HDL3 in normal cells, but cholesterol ester mobilization was significantly reduced in FHD cells. HDL3 binding to fibroblasts and the possible role of the HDL binding protein/vigilin in FHD were also investigated. No differences were observed in 125I-HDL3 binding to LDL-loaded cells between FHD and control cells. HDL binding protein/vigilin mRNA levels and its protein expression were constitutively expressed in FHD cells and could be modulated ( approximately 2-fold increase) by elevated cellular cholesterol in normal cells. In conclusion, FHD is characterized by reduced HDL3- and apoA-I-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux. It is not associated with abnormal cellular HDL3 binding or a defect in a putative HDL binding protein.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
10431236,Mutations in ABC1 in Tangier disease and familial high-density lipoprotein deficiency.,"Genes have a major role in the control of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Here we have identified two Tangier disease (TD) families, confirmed 9q31 linkage and refined the disease locus to a limited genomic region containing the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC1). Familial HDL deficiency (FHA) is a more frequent cause of low HDL levels. On the basis of independent linkage and meiotic recombinants, we localized the FHA locus to the same genomic region as the TD locus. Mutations in ABC1 were detected in both TD and FHA, indicating that TD and FHA are allelic. This indicates that the protein encoded by ABC1 is a key gatekeeper influencing intracellular cholesterol transport, hence we have named it cholesterol efflux regulatory protein (CERP).","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
7627690,"Severe familial HDL deficiency in French-Canadian kindreds. Clinical, biochemical, and molecular characterization.","A decreased level of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) is the most common lipoprotein abnormality seen in people with premature coronary artery disease (CAD). In many cases, HDL-C reduction in patients with CAD may be the result of increased apo B-containing lipoprotein production by the liver with secondary hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia is seen in approximately 4% of people with CAD. We report findings in four subjects with severe familial HDL deficiency (HDL-C << 5th percentile for age and sex; 0.08 to 0.38 mmol/L) in three French-Canadian kindreds with autosomal codominant inheritance. By inclusion criteria, all four subjects had normal fasting triglycerides and none were diabetic. HDL particle size by gradient gel electrophoresis revealed small HDL particles (estimated Stokes' diameter, 8.14 to 8.30 nm). Apo AI analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and use of isoelectrofocusing gels in affected subjects revealed normal molecular weight (28.3 kD) and normal isoelectrofocusing point but a relative increase in proapoliprotein AI, with near-normal levels of proapolipoprotein AI in plasma, suggesting normal secretion of apo AI. Quantitative Southern blot analysis of the apo AI-CIII-AIV gene cluster reveals no gene rearrangements or allele deletion. Haplotypes of the apo AI gene, determined by use of the restriction enzymes Pst I, Xmn I, and Sst I and of the apo AII gene by use of the enzyme Msp I, did not reveal segregation of the low HDL-C trait with either the apo AI or the AII gene. Sequence analysis of the promoter region of the apo AI gene reveals heterozygosity for guanine-to-adenine substitution at position 76 in two kindreds with no evidence of segregation with the low HDL trait. None of the patients had mutations of the lipoprotein lipase gene common in subjects of French-Canadian descent. Haplotype analysis of the lipoprotein lipase gene did not show segregation with the low HDL trait. Plasma lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity was found to be within normal levels in affected subjects and in nonaffected first-degree relatives. None of the affected subjects had clinical manifestations of Tangier disease. Two of the four cases examined, both men, had severe CAD and had undergone revascularization procedures. The third is a younger brother of one of these probands and the fourth is a 30-year-old woman, and both were free of clinical CAD. However, in none of the families did the low HDL trait unequivocally cosegregate with CAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
26142438,Whole exome sequencing identifies LRP1 as a pathogenic gene in autosomal recessive keratosis pilaris atrophicans.,"Keratosis pilaris atrophicans (KPA) is a group of rare genodermatoses characterised by perifollicular keratosis and inflammation that progresses to atrophy and scars of the facial skin. Keratosis pilaris of extensor areas of limbs is a common associated finding. Most cases with KPA are sporadic and no consistent inheritance pattern has been documented.A large consanguineous Pakistani pedigree segregating autosomal recessive KPA of a mixed type was subject to autozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing. Quantification of mRNA and protein levels was performed on fibroblasts from affected individuals. Cellular uptake of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) ligand α2-macroglobulin (α(2)M) was quantified using fluorescence confocal microscopy.Genetic analyses identified a unique homozygous missense variant (K1245R) in the LRP1 in all affected family members. LRP1 encodes the LRP1, a multifunctional cell surface receptor with endocytic functions that belongs to the LDL receptor family. The LRP1 mRNA and LRP1 protein levels in fibroblasts of affected individuals were markedly reduced when compared with controls. Similarly, the LRP1-mediated cellular uptake of α(2)M was reduced in patient fibroblasts.This is the first report on LRP1 as a pathogenic gene for autosomal recessive KPA and keratosis pilaris. The inflammatory characteristics of the KPA entity in our family suggest a link to the immune-regulatory functions of LRP1.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
12796258,ABCA4 gene sequence variations in patients with autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy.,"To identify sequence variations in the ABCA4 gene in a cohort of patients with autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy.The coding sequences of the ABCA4 gene were analyzed in 30 unrelated probands. In those patients with plausible disease-causing variations, correlations were made between genotype and fundus phenotype as well as with electrophysiological and visual field findings.Sixteen (53%) of 30 probands were found to harbor plausible disease-causing variations in the ABCA4 gene. Two distinctly different fundus phenotypes were observed in our cohort of patients. Twelve patients showed diffuse pigmentary degenerative changes, whereas 4 showed either no pigmentary changes or only a mild degree of peripheral pigment degeneration. An associa-tion between certain sequence variations and each of these 2 different phenotypes was observed.Our findings confirm that a substantial percentage of patients with autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy are likely to harbor a mutation in the ABCA4 gene as the cause of their disease. The fundus phenotype observed in such patients is quite variable, and certain fundus phenotypes may be more associated with certain genotypes. Clinical Relevance Identification of the molecular genetic basis for various inherited human retinal dystrophies, such as cone-rod dystrophy, facilitates a potentially better understanding of the mechanisms by which photoreceptor cells degenerate. This in turn provides guidance as to how to better proceed in identifying the most optimal future therapeutic strategies.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
12037008,Phenotypic spectrum of autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophies caused by mutations in the ABCA4 (ABCR) gene.,"To describe the phenotype of 12 patients with autosomal recessive or isolated cone-rod types of progressive retinal degeneration (CRD) caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene.The charts of patients who had originally received a diagnosis of isolated or autosomal recessive CRD were reviewed after molecular analysis revealed mutations in the ABCA4 gene.In two of the patients both the photopic and scotopic electroretinogram were nonrecordable. In the remainder, the photopic cone b-wave amplitudes appeared to be more seriously affected than the scotopic rod b-wave amplitudes. Although the clinical presentation was heterogeneous, all patients experienced visual loss early in life, impaired color vision, and a central scotoma. Fundoscopy revealed evidence of early-onset maculopathy, sometimes accompanied by involvement of the retinal periphery in the later stages of the disease.Mutations in the ABCA4 gene are the pathologic cause of the CRD-like dystrophy in these patients, and the resultant clinical pictures are complex and heterogeneous. Given this wide clinical spectrum of CRD-like phenotypes associated with ABCA4 mutations, detailed clinical subclassifications are difficult and may not be very useful.",research-article; journal article
11846417,Titin mutations as the molecular basis for dilated cardiomyopathy.,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heterogeneous cardiac disease characterized by ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction. Recent genetic studies have revealed that mutations in genes for cardiac sarcomere components lead to DCM. The cardiac sarcomere consists of thick and thin filaments and a giant protein, titin. Because one of the loci of familial DCM was mapped to the region of the titin gene, we searched for titin mutations in the patients and identified four possible disease-associated mutations. Two mutations, Val54Met and Ala743Val, were found in the Z-line region of titin and decreased binding affinities of titin to Z-line proteins T-cap/telethonin and alpha-actinin, respectively, in yeast two-hybrid assays. The other two mutations were found in the cardiac-specific N2-B region of titin and one of them was a nonsense mutation, Glu4053ter, presumably encoding for a truncated nonfunctional molecule. These observations suggest that titin mutations may cause DCM in a subset of the patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
22335739,Truncations of titin causing dilated cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND:Dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy arise from mutations in many genes. TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomere protein titin, has been insufficiently analyzed for cardiomyopathy mutations because of its enormous size. METHODS:We analyzed TTN in 312 subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy, 231 subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 249 controls by using next-generation or dideoxy sequencing. We evaluated deleterious variants for cosegregation in families and assessed clinical characteristics. RESULTS:We identified 72 unique mutations (25 nonsense, 23 frameshift, 23 splicing, and 1 large tandem insertion) that altered full-length titin. Among subjects studied by means of next-generation sequencing, the frequency of TTN mutations was significantly higher among subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy (54 of 203 [27%]) than among subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (3 of 231 [1%], P=3×10(-16)) or controls (7 of 249 [3%], P=9×10(-14)). TTN mutations cosegregated with dilated cardiomyopathy in families (combined lod score, 11.1) with high (>95%) observed penetrance after the age of 40 years. Mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy were overrepresented in the titin A-band but were absent from the Z-disk and M-band regions of titin (P≤0.01 for all comparisons). Overall, the rates of cardiac outcomes were similar in subjects with and those without TTN mutations, but adverse events occurred earlier in male mutation carriers than in female carriers (P=4×10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS:TTN truncating mutations are a common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, occurring in approximately 25% of familial cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and in 18% of sporadic cases. Incorporation of sequencing approaches that detect TTN truncations into genetic testing for dilated cardiomyopathy should substantially increase test sensitivity, thereby allowing earlier diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Defining the functional effects of TTN truncating mutations should improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy.

11238270,Novel gene mutations in patients with left ventricular noncompaction or Barth syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the gene G4.5 result in a wide spectrum of severe infantile cardiomyopathic phenotypes, including isolated left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), as well as Barth syndrome (BTHS) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The purpose of this study was to investigate patients with LVNC or BTHS for mutations in G4.5 or other novel genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA was isolated from 2 families and 3 individuals with isolated LVNC or LVNC with congenital heart disease (CHD), as well as 4 families with BTHS associated with LVNC or DCM, and screened for mutations by single-strand DNA conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. In 1 family with LVNC and CHD, a C-->T mutation was identified at nucleotide 362 of alpha-dystrobrevin, changing a proline to leucine (P121L). Mutations in G4.5 were identified in 2 families with isolated LVNC: a missense mutation in exon 4 (C118R) in 1 and a splice donor mutation (IVS10+2T-->A) in intron 10 in the other. In a family with cardiomyopathies ranging from BTHS or fatal infantile cardiomyopathy to asymptomatic DCM, a splice acceptor mutation in exon 2 of G4.5 (398-2 A-->G) was identified, and a 1-bp deletion in exon 2 of G4.5, resulting in a stop codon after amino acid 41, was identified in a sporadic case of BTHS. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate genetic heterogeneity in LVNC, with mutation of a novel gene, alpha-dystrobrevin, identified in LVNC associated with CHD. In addition, these results confirm that mutations in G4.5 result in a wide phenotypic spectrum of cardiomyopathies.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20004881,Targeted next-generation sequencing appoints c16orf57 as clericuzio-type poikiloderma with neutropenia gene.,"Next-generation sequencing is a straightforward tool for the identification of disease genes in extended genomic regions. Autozygosity mapping was performed on a five-generation inbred Italian family with three siblings affected with Clericuzio-type poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN [MIM %604173]), a rare autosomal-recessive genodermatosis characterised by poikiloderma, pachyonychia, and chronic neutropenia. The siblings were initially diagnosed as affected with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS [MIM #268400]), with which PN shows phenotypic overlap. Linkage analysis on all living subjects of the family identified a large 16q region inherited identically by descent (IBD) in all affected family members. Deep sequencing of this 3.4 Mb region previously enriched with array capture revealed a homozygous c.504-2 A>C mismatch in all affected siblings. The mutation destroys the invariant AG acceptor site of intron 4 of the evolutionarily conserved C16orf57 gene. Two distinct deleterious mutations (c.502A>G and c.666_676+1del12) identified in an unrelated PN patient confirmed that the C16orf57 gene is responsible for PN. The function of the predicted C16orf57 gene is unknown, but its product has been shown to be interconnected to RECQL4 protein via SMAD4 proteins. The unravelled clinical and genetic identity of PN allows patients to undergo genetic testing and follow-up.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
22578326,GPSM2 mutations cause the brain malformations and hearing loss in Chudley-McCullough syndrome.,"Autosomal-recessive inheritance, severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum are hallmarks of the clinically well-established Chudley-McCullough syndrome (CMS). Although not always reported in the literature, frontal polymicrogyria and gray matter heterotopia are uniformly present, whereas cerebellar dysplasia, ventriculomegaly, and arachnoid cysts are nearly invariant. Despite these striking brain malformations, individuals with CMS generally do not present with significant neurodevelopmental abnormalities, except for hearing loss. Homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing of DNA from affected individuals in eight families (including the family in the first report of CMS) revealed four molecular variations (two single-base deletions, a nonsense mutation, and a canonical splice-site mutation) in the G protein-signaling modulator 2 gene, GPSM2, that underlie CMS. Mutations in GPSM2 have been previously identified in people with profound congenital nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Subsequent brain imaging of these individuals revealed frontal polymicrogyria, abnormal corpus callosum, and gray matter heterotopia, consistent with a CMS diagnosis, but no ventriculomegaly. The gene product, GPSM2, is required for orienting the mitotic spindle during cell division in multiple tissues, suggesting that the sensorineural hearing loss and characteristic brain malformations of CMS are due to defects in asymmetric cell divisions during development.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
10441571,Missense mutation in the alternative splice region of the PAX6 gene in eye anomalies.,"The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis, and PAX6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies, including aniridia, Peters anomaly, corneal dystrophy, congenital cataract, and foveal hypoplasia. The gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired-type DNA-binding domain. The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA-binding subdomains, the N-terminal subdomain (NTS) and the C-terminal subdomain (CTS), which bind respective consensus DNA sequences. The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain. The insertion, into the NTS, of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA-binding ability of the CTS. Thus, exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes. We ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with Peters anomaly, congenital cataract, Axenfeldt anomaly, and/or foveal hypoplasia, which, to our knowledge, is the first mutation identified in the splice-variant region. A T-->A transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val-->Asp (GTC-->GAC) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region. Functional analyses demonstrated that the V54D mutation slightly increased NTS binding and decreased CTS transactivation activity to almost half.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
21310915,Screening of SPATA7 in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis and severe childhood-onset retinal dystrophy reveals disease-causing mutations.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence of sequence variants in the gene SPATA7 in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and autosomal recessive, severe, early-onset retinal dystrophy (EORD) and to delineate the ocular phenotype associated with SPATA7 mutations. METHODS: Patients underwent standard ophthalmic evaluation after providing informed consent. One hundred forty-one DNA samples from patients with LCA and EORD had been analyzed for mutations by using a microarray, with negative results. One additional patient underwent SPATA7 screening due to a region of autozygosity surrounding this gene. A further patient was screened who had a compatible ocular phenotype. The entire SPATA7 coding sequence was assayed, including the intron-exon junctions, by using a combination of direct DNA sequencing and high-resolution melting screening. RESULTS: Screening of SPATA7 identified several known and novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Affected individuals from five unrelated families were identified to have coding changes. Clinical features demonstrated a severe infantile onset retinal dystrophy, similar to Leber congenital amaurosis. The retina had widespread retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, with minimal pigment migration into the neurosensory retina. Fundus autofluorescence imaging showed a parafoveal annulus of increased autofluorescence. High-definition optical coherence tomography showed preservation of the inner segment/outer segment junction at the fovea. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in SPATA7 are a rare cause of childhood retinal dystrophy accounting for 1.7% of disease in this cohort. Affected patients present in infancy with severe visual loss, but may have some preservation of the photoreceptor structure in the central retina.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
11313241,New mutations inactivating transferrin receptor 2 in hemochromatosis type 3.,"Hereditary hemochromatosis usually results from C282Y homozygosity in the HFE gene on chromosome 6p. Recently, a new type of hemochromatosis (HFE3) has been characterized in 2 unrelated Italian families with a disorder linked to 7q. Patients with HFE3 have transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) inactivated by a homozygous nonsense mutation (Y250X). Here the identification of 2 new TFR2 mutations is reported. In a large inbred family from Campania, a frameshift mutation (84-88 insC) in exon 2 that causes a premature stop codon (E60X) is identified. In a single patient with nonfamilial hemochromatosis, a T-->A transversion (T515A), which causes a Methionine-->Lysine substitution at position 172 of the protein (M172K), has been characterized. TFR2 gene gives origin to 2 alternatively spliced transcripts-the alpha-transcript, which may encode a transmembrane protein, and the beta-transcript, a shorter, possibly intracellular variant. Based on their positions, the effects of the identified mutations on the 2 TFR2 forms are expected to differ. Y250X inactivates both transcripts, whereas E60X inactivates only the alpha-form. M172K has a complex effect: it causes a missense in the alpha-form, but it may also prevent the beta-form production because it affects its putative initiation codon. Analysis of the clinical phenotype of 13 HFE3 homozygotes characterized at the molecular level has shown a variable severity, from nonexpressing patients to severe clinical complications. The identification of new mutations of TFR2 confirms that this gene is associated with iron overload and offers a tool for molecular diagnosis in patients without HFE mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
12130528,Transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) and HFE mutational analysis in non-C282Y iron overload: identification of a novel TfR2 mutation.,"Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is classically associated with a Cys282Tyr (C282Y) mutation of the HFE gene. Non-C282Y HH is a heterogeneous group accounting for 15% of HH in Northern Europe. Pathogenic mutations of the transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) gene have been identified in 4 Italian pedigrees with the latter syndrome. The goal of this study was to perform a mutational analysis of the TfR2 and HFE genes in a cohort of non-C282Y iron overload patients of mixed ethnic backgrounds. Several sequence variants were identified within the TfR2 gene, including a homozygous missense change in exon 17, c2069 A-->C, which changes a glutamine to a proline residue at position 690. This putative mutation was found in a severely affected Portuguese man and 2 family members with the same genotype. In summary, pathologic TfR2 mutations are present outside of Italy, accounting for a small proportion of non-C282Y HH.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
10470086,Familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome: A short-period circadian rhythm variant in humans.,"Biological circadian clocks oscillate with an approximately 24-hour period, are ubiquitous, and presumably confer a selective advantage by anticipating the transitions between day and night. The circadian rhythms of sleep, melatonin secretion and body core temperature are thought to be generated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, the anatomic locus of the mammalian circadian clock. Autosomal semi-dominant mutations in rodents with fast or slow biological clocks (that is, short or long endogenous period lengths; tau) are associated with phase-advanced or delayed sleep-wake rhythms, respectively. These models predict the existence of familial human circadian rhythm variants but none of the human circadian rhythm disorders are known to have a familial tendency. Although a slight 'morning lark' tendency is common, individuals with a large and disabling sleep phase-advance are rare. This disorder, advanced sleep-phase syndrome, is characterized by very early sleep onset and offset; only two cases are reported in young adults. Here we describe three kindreds with a profound phase advance of the sleep-wake, melatonin and temperature rhythms associated with a very short tau. The trait segregates as an autosomal dominant with high penetrance. These kindreds represent a well-characterized familial circadian rhythm variant in humans and provide a unique opportunity for genetic analysis of human circadian physiology.",historical article; review-article; review; journal article
18653847,Human CHN1 mutations hyperactivate alpha2-chimaerin and cause Duane's retraction syndrome.,"Duane's retraction syndrome (DRS) is a complex congenital eye movement disorder caused by aberrant innervation of the extraocular muscles by axons of brainstem motor neurons. Studying families with a variant form of the disorder (DURS2-DRS), we have identified causative heterozygous missense mutations in CHN1, a gene on chromosome 2q31 that encodes alpha2-chimaerin, a Rac guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (RacGAP) signaling protein previously implicated in the pathfinding of corticospinal axons in mice. We found that these are gain-of-function mutations that increase alpha2-chimaerin RacGAP activity in vitro. Several of the mutations appeared to enhance alpha2-chimaerin translocation to the cell membrane or enhance its ability to self-associate. Expression of mutant alpha2-chimaerin constructs in chick embryos resulted in failure of oculomotor axons to innervate their target extraocular muscles. We conclude that alpha2-chimaerin has a critical developmental function in ocular motor axon pathfinding.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25623524,Familial focal epilepsy with focal cortical dysplasia due to DEPDC5 mutations.,"OBJECTIVE: The DEPDC5 (DEP domain-containing protein 5) gene, encoding a repressor of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, has recently emerged as a major gene mutated in familial focal epilepsies. We aimed to further extend the role of DEPDC5 to focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs). METHODS: Seven patients from 4 families with DEPDC5 mutations and focal epilepsy associated with FCD were recruited and investigated at the clinical, neuroimaging, and histopathological levels. The DEPDC5 gene was sequenced from genomic blood and brain DNA. RESULTS: All patients had drug-resistant focal epilepsy, 5 of them underwent surgery, and 1 had a brain biopsy. Electroclinical phenotypes were compatible with FCD II, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was typical in only 4 cases. Histopathology confirmed FCD IIa in 2 patients (including 1 MRI-negative case) and showed FCD I in 2 other patients, and remained inconclusive in the last 2 patients. Three patients were seizure-free postsurgically, and 1 had a worthwhile improvement. Sequencing of blood DNA revealed truncating DEPDC5 mutations in all 4 families; 1 mutation was found to be mosaic in an asymptomatic father. A brain somatic DEPDC5 mutation was identified in 1 patient in addition to the germline mutation. INTERPRETATION: Germline, germline mosaic, and brain somatic DEPDC5 mutations may cause epilepsy associated with FCD, reinforcing the link between mTORC1 pathway and FCDs. Similarly to other mTORopathies, a ""2-hit"" mutational model could be responsible for cortical lesions. Our study also indicates that epilepsy surgery is a valuable alternative in the treatment of drug-resistant DEPDC5-positive focal epilepsies, even if the MRI is unremarkable.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
7545954,A strong candidate for the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1.,"A strong candidate for the 17q-linked BRCA1 gene, which influences susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer, has been identified by positional cloning methods. Probable predisposing mutations have been detected in five of eight kindreds presumed to segregate BRCA1 susceptibility alleles. The mutations include an 11-base pair deletion, a 1-base pair insertion, a stop codon, a missense substitution, and an inferred regulatory mutation. The BRCA1 gene is expressed in numerous tissues, including breast and ovary, and encodes a predicted protein of 1863 amino acids. This protein contains a zinc finger domain in its amino-terminal region, but is otherwise unrelated to previously described proteins. Identification of BRCA1 should facilitate early diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility in some individuals as well as a better understanding of breast cancer biology.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
11179017,Prevalence and penetrance of germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a population series of 649 women with ovarian cancer.,"A population-based series of 649 unselected incident cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in Ontario, Canada, during 1995-96 was screened for germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. We specifically tested for 11 of the most commonly reported mutations in the two genes. Then, cases were assessed with the protein-truncation test (PTT) for exon 11 of BRCA1, with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for the remainder of BRCA1, and with PTT for exons 10 and 11 of BRCA2. No mutations were found in all 134 women with tumors of borderline histology. Among the 515 women with invasive cancers, we identified 60 mutations, 39 in BRCA1 and 21 in BRCA2. The total mutation frequency among women with invasive cancers, 11.7% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 9.2%-14.8%), is higher than previous estimates. Hereditary ovarian cancers diagnosed at age <50 years were mostly (83%) due to BRCA1, whereas the majority (60%) of those diagnosed at age >60 years were due to BRCA2. Mutations were found in 19% of women reporting first-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer and in 6.5% of women with no affected first-degree relatives. Risks of ovarian, breast, and stomach cancers and leukemias/lymphomas were increased nine-, five-, six- and threefold, respectively, among first-degree relatives of cases carrying BRCA1 mutations, compared with relatives of noncarriers, and risk of colorectal cancer was increased threefold for relatives of cases carrying BRCA2 mutations. For carriers of BRCA1 mutations, the estimated penetrance by age 80 years was 36% for ovarian cancer and 68% for breast cancer. In breast-cancer risk for first-degree relatives, there was a strong trend according to mutation location along the coding sequence of BRCA1, with little evidence of increased risk for mutations in the 5' fifth, but 8.8-fold increased risk for mutations in the 3' fifth (95%CI 3.6-22.0), corresponding to a carrier penetrance of essentially 100%. Ovarian, colorectal, stomach, pancreatic, and prostate cancer occurred among first-degree relatives of carriers of BRCA2 mutations only when mutations were in the ovarian cancer-cluster region (OCCR) of exon 11, whereas an excess of breast cancer was seen when mutations were outside the OCCR. For cancers of all sites combined, the estimated penetrance of BRCA2 mutations was greater for males than for females, 53% versus 38%. Past studies may have underestimated the contribution of BRCA2 to ovarian cancer, because mutations in this gene cause predominantly late-onset cancer, and previous work has focused more on early-onset disease. If confirmed in future studies, the trend in breast-cancer penetrance, according to mutation location along the BRCA1 coding sequence, may have significant impact on treatment decisions for carriers of BRCA1-mutations. As well, BRCA2 mutations may prove to be a greater cause of cancer in male carriers than previously has been thought.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research-article; journal article"
18313022,"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 5 is a fully penetrant, lethal arrhythmic disorder caused by a missense mutation in the TMEM43 gene.","Autosomal-dominant arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) causes sudden cardiac death and is characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Fifteen unrelated ARVC families with a disease-associated haplotype on chromosome 3p (ARVD5) were ascertained from a genetically isolated population. Identification of key recombination events reduced the disease region to a 2.36 Mb interval containing 20 annotated genes. Bidirectional resequencing showed one rare variant in transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43 1073C-->T, S358L), was carried on all recombinant ARVD5 ancestral haplotypes from affected subjects and not found in population controls. The mutation occurs in a highly conserved transmembrane domain of TMEM43 and is predicted to be deleterious. Clinical outcomes in 257 affected and 151 unaffected subjects were compared, and penetrance was determined. We concluded that ARVC at locus ARVD5 is a lethal, fully penetrant, sex-influenced morbid disorder. Median life expectancy was 41 years in affected males compared to 71 years in affected females (relative risk 6.8, 95% CI 1.3-10.9). Heart failure was a late manifestation in survivors. Although little is known about the function of the TMEM43 gene, it contains a response element for PPAR gamma (an adipogenic transcription factor), which may explain the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, a characteristic pathological finding in ARVC.",review-article; review; journal article
10631146,The locus of a novel gene responsible for arrhythmogenic right-ventricular dysplasia characterized by early onset and high penetrance maps to chromosome 10p12-p14.,"Arrhythmogenic right-ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), a cardiomyopathy inherited as an autosomal-dominant disease, is characterized by fibro-fatty infiltration of the right-ventricular myocardium. Four loci for ARVD have been mapped in the Italian population, and recently the first locus was mapped in inhabitants of North America. None of the genes have been identified. We have now identified another North American family with early onset of ARVD and high penetrance. All of the children with the disease haplotype had pathological or clinical evidence of the disease at age <10 years. The family spans five generations, having 10 living and 2 dead affected individuals, with ARVD segregating as an autosomal-dominant disorder. Genetic linkage analysis excluded known loci, and a novel locus was identified on chromosome 10p12-p14. A peak two-point LOD score of 3.92 was obtained with marker D10S1664, at a recombination fraction of 0. Additional genotyping and haplotype analysis identified a shared region of 10.6 cM between marker D10S547 and D10S1653. Thus, a novel gene responsible for ARVD resides on the short arm of chromosome 10. This disease is intriguing, since it initiates exclusively in the right ventricle and exhibits pathological features of apoptosis. Chromosomal localization of the ARVD gene is the first step in identification of the genetic defect and the unraveling of the molecular basis responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
10233227,Skin fragility and hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia resulting from ablation of plakophilin 1.,"We report a 2-year-old boy with an unusual autosomal recessively inherited skin disease comprising trauma-induced skin fragility and congenital ectodermal dysplasia affecting hair, nails and sweat glands. Skin biopsy showed widening of intercellular spaces between keratinocytes and ultrastructural findings of small, poorly formed desmosomes with reduced connections to the keratin filament cytoskeleton. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a complete absence of staining for the accessory desmosomal plaque protein plakophilin 1 (PKP1; band 6 protein). The affected individual was a compound heterozygote for null mutations on both alleles of the PKP1 gene. Both mutations occurred within the amino terminus of PKP1, the domain which normally binds the cytoskeletal keratin filament network to the cell membrane. Apart from its localization within desmosomal plaques, PKP1 may also be present within the cytoplasm and nucleus and has putative roles in signal transduction and regulation of gene activity. The clinicopathological observations in this patient demonstrate the relevance of PKP1 to desmosome formation, cutaneous cell-cell adhesion and epidermal development and demonstrate the specific manifestations of human functional knockout mutations in this gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
17546029,"Mutations in LCA5, encoding the ciliary protein lebercilin, cause Leber congenital amaurosis.","Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) causes blindness or severe visual impairment at or within a few months of birth. Here we show, using homozygosity mapping, that the LCA5 gene on chromosome 6q14, which encodes the previously unknown ciliary protein lebercilin, is associated with this disease. We detected homozygous nonsense and frameshift mutations in LCA5 in five families affected with LCA. In a sixth family, the LCA5 transcript was completely absent. LCA5 is expressed widely throughout development, although the phenotype in affected individuals is limited to the eye. Lebercilin localizes to the connecting cilia of photoreceptors and to the microtubules, centrioles and primary cilia of cultured mammalian cells. Using tandem affinity purification, we identified 24 proteins that link lebercilin to centrosomal and ciliary functions. Members of this interactome represent candidate genes for LCA and other ciliopathies. Our findings emphasize the emerging role of disrupted ciliary processes in the molecular pathogenesis of LCA.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
10684912,Orthostatic intolerance and tachycardia associated with norepinephrine-transporter deficiency.,"Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome characterized by lightheadedness, fatigue, altered mentation, and syncope and associated with postural tachycardia and plasma norepinephrine concentrations that are disproportionately high in relation to sympathetic outflow. We tested the hypothesis that impaired functioning of the norepinephrine transporter contributes to the pathophysiologic mechanism of orthostatic intolerance.In a patient with orthostatic intolerance and her relatives, we measured postural blood pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamines, and systemic norepinephrine spillover and clearance, and we sequenced the norepinephrine-transporter gene and evaluated its function.The patient had a high mean plasma norepinephrine concentration while standing, as compared with the mean (+/-SD) concentration in normal subjects (923 vs. 439+/-129 pg per milliliter [5.46 vs. 2.59+/-0.76 nmol per liter]), reduced systemic norepinephrine clearance (1.56 vs. 2.42+/-0.71 liters per minute), impairment in the increase in the plasma norepinephrine concentration after the administration of tyramine (12 vs. 56+/-63 pg per milliliter [0.07 vs. 0.33+/-0.37 pmol per liter]), and a disproportionate increase in the concentration of plasma norepinephrine relative to that of dihydroxyphenylglycol. Analysis of the norepinephrine-transporter gene revealed that the proband was heterozygous for a mutation in exon 9 (encoding a change from guanine to cytosine at position 237) that resulted in more than a 98 percent loss of function as compared with that of the wild-type gene. Impairment of synaptic norepinephrine clearance may result in a syndrome characterized by excessive sympathetic activation in response to physiologic stimuli. The mutant allele in the proband's family segregated with the postural heart rate and abnormal plasma catecholamine homeostasis.Genetic or acquired deficits in norepinephrine inactivation may underlie hyperadrenergic states that lead to orthostatic intolerance.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; case reports"
10430757,Desmin mutation responsible for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, of which approximately 20% of cases are familial (FDCM), is a primary myocardial disorder characterized by ventricular dilatation and impaired systolic function. It is a common cause of heart failure and the need for cardiac transplantation. Although 6 chromosomal loci responsible for autosomal dominant FDCM have been mapped by linkage analysis, none of these genes have been identified. By use of the candidate-gene approach, actin was identified recently as being responsible for dilated cardiomyopathy. Considerable evidence suggests desmin, a muscle-specific intermediate filament, plays a significant role in cardiac growth and development. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine whether a defect of desmin induces dilated cardiomyopathy, 44 probands with FDCM underwent clinical evaluation and DNA analysis. Diagnostic criteria, detected by echocardiography, consisted of ventricular dimension of >/=2.7 cm/m(2) with an ejection fraction </=50% in the absence of other potential causes. After amplification by polymerase chain reaction, the exons of the desmin gene were sequenced. A missense desmin mutation, Ile451Met, which cosegregates with FDCM without clinically evident skeletal muscle abnormalities, was identified in a 4-generation family but was not detected in 460 unrelated healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: A novel missense mutation of desmin, Ile451Met, was identified as the genetic cause of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This finding is of particular significance because this is the first mutation detected in the desmin tail domain, and the function of the desmin tail remains unknown. Because this mutation leads to a restricted cardiac phenotype in the family studied in the present report, it suggests that the tail of desmin plays an important functional role in cardiac tissue.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
10677302,Assignment of a form of congenital muscular dystrophy with secondary merosin deficiency to chromosome 1q42.,"We have previously reported an autosomal recessive form of congenital muscular dystrophy, characterized by proximal girdle weakness, generalized muscle hypertrophy, rigidity of the spine, and contractures of the tendo Achilles, in a consanguineous family from the United Arab Emirates. Early respiratory failure resulting from severe diaphragmatic involvement was present. Intellect and the results of brain imaging were normal. Serum creatine kinase levels were grossly elevated, and muscle-biopsy samples showed dystrophic changes. The expression of the laminin-alpha2 chain of merosin was reduced on several fibers, but linkage analysis excluded the LAMA2 locus on chromosome 6q22-23. Here, we report the results of genomewide linkage analysis of this family, by use of homozygosity mapping. In all four affected children, an identical homozygous region was identified on chromosome 1q42, spanning 6-15 cM between flanking markers D1S2860 and D1S2800. We have identified a second German family with two affected children having similar clinical and histopathological features; they are consistent with linkage to the same locus. The cumulative LOD score was 3.57 (straight theta=.00) at marker D1S213. This represents a novel locus for congenital muscular dystrophy. We suggest calling this disorder ""CMD1B."" The expression of three functional candidate genes in the CMD1B critical region was investigated, and no detectable changes in their level of expression were observed. The secondary reduction in laminin-alpha2 chain in these families suggests that the primary genetic defect resides in a gene coding for a protein involved in basal lamina assembly.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
12417987,A missense mutation (R565W) in cirhin (FLJ14728) in North American Indian childhood cirrhosis.,"North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (CIRH1A, or NAIC), a severe autosomal recessive intrahepatic cholestasis described in Ojibway-Cree children from northwestern Quebec, is one of several familial cholestases with unknown molecular etiology. It typically presents with transient neonatal jaundice, in a child who is otherwise healthy, and progresses to biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Clinical and physiological investigations have not revealed the underlying cause of the disease. Currently, liver transplantation is the only effective therapy for patients with advanced disease. We previously identified the NAIC locus by homozygosity mapping to chromosome 16q22. Here we report that an exon 15 mutation in gene FLJ14728 (alias Cirhin) causes NAIC: c.1741C-->T in GenBank cDNA sequence NM_032830, found in all NAIC chromosomes, changes the conserved arginine 565 codon to a tryptophan, altering the predicted secondary structure of the protein. Cirhin is preferentially expressed in embryonic liver, is predicted to localize to mitochondria, and contains WD repeats, which are structural motifs frequently associated with molecular scaffolds.",journal article; case-report
26564089,Epidermal nevus syndromes.,"The term epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) has been used to describe the association of epidermal hamartomas and extracutaneous abnormalities. Although many continue to use the term ""ENS,"" it is now understood that this is not one disease, but rather a heterogeneous group with distinct genetic profiles defined by a common cutaneous phenotype: the presence of epidermal and adnexal hamartomas that are associated with other organ system involvement. One commonality is that epidermal nevi often follow the lines of Blaschko and it appears the more widespread the cutaneous manifestations, the greater the risk for extracutaneous manifestations. The majority of the extracutaneous manifestations involve the brain, eye, and skeletal systems. The CNS involvement is wide ranging and involves both clinical manifestations such as intellectual disability and seizures, as well as structural anomalies. Several subsets of ENS with characteristic features have been delineated including the nevus sebaceus syndrome, Proteus syndrome, CHILD syndrome, Becker's nevus syndrome, nevus comedonicus syndrome, and phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica. Advances in molecular biology have revealed that the manifestations of ENS are due to genomic mosaicism. It is likely that the varied clinical manifestations of ENS are due in great part to the functional effects of specific genetic defects. Optimal management of the patient with ENS involves an interdisciplinary approach given the potential for multisystem involvement. Of note, epidermal nevi have been associated with both benign and malignant neoplasms, and thus ongoing clinical follow-up is required.",review; journal article

10739754,Homozygosity mapping identifies an additional locus for Wolfram syndrome on chromosome 4q.,"Wolfram syndrome, which is sometimes referred to as ""DIDMOAD"" (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness), is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder for which only insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy are necessary to make the diagnosis. Researchers have mapped Wolfram syndrome to chromosome 4p16.1, and, recently, a gene encoding a putative transmembrane protein has been cloned and mutations have been identified in patients. To pursue the possibility of locus heterogeneity, 16 patients from four different families were recruited. These patients, who have the Wolfram syndrome phenotype, also have additional features that have not previously been reported. There is an absence of diabetes insipidus in all affected family members. In addition, several patients have profound upper gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. With the use of three microsatellite markers (D4S432, D4S3023, and D4S2366) reported to be linked to the chromosome 4p16.1 locus, we significantly excluded linkage in three of the four families. The two affected individuals in one family showed homozygosity for all three markers from the region of linkage on chromosome 4p16.1. For the other three families, genetic heterogeneity for Wolfram syndrome was verified by demonstration of linkage to chromosome 4q22-24. In conclusion, we report the unique clinical findings and linkage-analysis results of 16 patients with Wolfram syndrome and provide further evidence for the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder. We also provide data on a new locus that plays a role in the etiology of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
11317648,Bleeding tendency in Wolfram syndrome: a newly identified feature with phenotype genotype correlation.,"Wolfram syndrome (WS) is a recessively inherited disorder associated with recognised clinical features. Bleeding tendency was noticed in some of our patients, although this has not been reported before. We therefore studied this problem in all our WS patients and tried to postulate a possible pathogenesis. At the same time, a genetic linkage study provided evidence of locus heterogeneity of this syndrome and showed that the majority of our patients belong to the second WS locus identified in that study. Our study group consisted of 13 WS patients, belonging to WSF2 locus (group I). Controls consisted of 4 healthy siblings of WS patients (group II) and 7 diabetics who do not have WS (group III). Relevant clinical data were obtained, and a coagulation screen was carried out for all groups. All individuals in the three study groups have normal platelet count, thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), clot retraction, Factor VIII activity (FVIIIc) and von Willebrand factor antigen (vWAg). Eleven of the WS patients have prolonged template bleeding time (BT) compared with both control groups. Patients with WS have a longer BT (mean 9.6 min, 95% CL 8.61-10.53 min) than the siblings group (mean 6.75 min, 95% CL 5.52-7.98 min) and the diabetic group (mean 5.49 min, 95% CL 4.56-6.42 min). The differences between the study group and controls are statistically significant, p = 0.02 and 0.0002, respectively. In the three groups, platelet aggregation studies were normal using adenosine diphosphate (ADP), ristocetin and epinephrine. Aggregation with collagen was either absent or impaired, with failure of secondary wave being noticed in 11 of the WS patients (85%) and normal in the control groups. The pathogenesis of this problem is not known, but could be due to an inhibitory effect of vWAgII, deficiency of thrombospondin or a defect in the platelet membrane GPIa/IIa. Bleeding diathesis is a new additional feature to the clinical spectrum of WS, which is probably a feature of the disorder WFS2 and not WFS1, as bleeding has never been reported in the latter. This provides further evidence for the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of this complex disorder and may provide clues to the search for the second gene responsible for this phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

9140397,Germline and somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET proto-oncogene in papillary renal carcinomas.,"Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is a recently recognized form of inherited kidney cancer characterized by a predisposition to develop multiple, bilateral papillary renal tumours. The pattern of inheritance of HPRC is consistent with autosomal dominant transmission with reduced penetrance. HPRC is histologically and genetically distinct from two other causes of inherited renal carcinoma, von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and the chromosome translocation (3;8). Malignant papillary renal carcinomas are characterized by trisomy of chromosomes 7, 16 and 17, and in men, by loss of the Y chromosome. Inherited and sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas are characterized by inactivation of both copies of the VHL gene by mutation, and/or by hypermethylation. We found that the HPRC gene was located at chromosome 7q31.1-34 in a 27-centimorgan (cM) interval between D7S496 and D7S1837. We identified missense mutations located in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene in the germline of affected members of HPRC families and in a subset of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas. Three mutations in the MET gene are located in codons that are homologous to those in c-kit and RET, proto-oncogenes that are targets of naturally-occurring mutations. The results suggest that missense mutations located in the MET proto-oncogene lead to constitutive activation of the MET protein and papillary renal carcinomas.",other; journal article
10884226,Activating mineralocorticoid receptor mutation in hypertension exacerbated by pregnancy.,"Hypertension and pregnancy-related hypertension are major public health problems of largely unknown causes. We describe a mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), S810L, that causes early-onset hypertension that is markedly exacerbated in pregnancy. This mutation results in constitutive MR activity and alters receptor specificity, with progesterone and other steroids lacking 21-hydroxyl groups, normally MR antagonists, becoming potent agonists. Structural and biochemical studies indicate that the mutation results in the gain of a van der Waals interaction between helix 5 and helix 3 that substitutes for interaction of the steroid 21-hydroxyl group with helix 3 in the wild-type receptor. This helix 5-helix 3 interaction is highly conserved among diverse nuclear hormone receptors, suggesting its general role in receptor activation.","comment; research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
10777717,A novel locus (DFNA23) for prelingual autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss maps to 14q21-q22 in a Swiss German kindred.,"DFNA23, a novel locus for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, was identified in a Swiss German kindred. DNA samples were obtained from 22 family members in three generations: 10 with hearing impairment caused by the DFNA23 locus, 8 unaffected offspring, and 4 spouses of hearing-impaired pedigree members. In this kindred, the hearing-impaired family members have prelingual bilateral symmetrical hearing loss. All audiograms from hearing-impaired individuals displayed sloping curves, with hearing ability ranging from normal hearing to mild hearing loss in low frequencies, normal hearing to profound hearing loss in mid frequencies, and moderate to profound hearing loss in high frequencies. A conductive component existed for 50% of the hearing-impaired family members. The majority of the hearing-impaired family members did not display progression of hearing loss. The DFNA23 locus maps to 14q21-q22. Linkage analysis was carried out under a fully penetrant autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with no phenocopies. A maximum multipoint LOD score of 5.1 occurred at Marker D14S290.

21129728,"Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in chondroitin synthase 1, a potential target of BMP signaling.","Altered Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling leads to multiple developmental defects, including brachydactyly and deafness. Here we identify chondroitin synthase 1 (CHSY1) as a potential mediator of BMP effects. We show that loss of human CHSY1 function causes autosomal-recessive Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly syndrome (TPBS), mainly characterized by limb malformations, short stature, and hearing loss. After mapping the TPBS locus to chromosome 15q26-qterm, we identified causative mutations in five consanguineous TPBS families. In zebrafish, antisense-mediated chsy1 knockdown causes defects in multiple developmental processes, some of which are likely to also be causative in the etiology of TPBS. In the inner ears of zebrafish larvae, chsy1 is expressed similarly to the BMP inhibitor dan and in a complementary fashion to bmp2b. Furthermore, unrestricted Bmp2b signaling or loss of Dan activity leads to reduced chsy1 expression and, during epithelial morphogenesis, defects similar to those that occur upon Chsy1 inactivation, indicating that Bmp signaling affects inner-ear development by repressing chsy1. In addition, we obtained strikingly similar zebrafish phenotypes after chsy1 overexpression, which might explain why, in humans, brachydactyly can be caused by mutations leading either to loss or to gain of BMP signaling.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
10839977,Split-hand/split-foot malformation is caused by mutations in the p63 gene on 3q27.,"Split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM), a limb malformation involving the central rays of the autopod and presenting with syndactyly, median clefts of the hands and feet, and aplasia and/or hypoplasia of the phalanges, metacarpals, and metatarsals, is phenotypically analogous to the naturally occurring murine Dactylaplasia mutant (Dac). Results of recent studies have shown that, in heterozygous Dac embryos, the central segment of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) degenerates, leaving the anterior and posterior segments intact; this finding suggests that localized failure of ridge maintenance activity is the fundamental developmental defect in Dac and, by inference, in SHFM. Results of gene-targeting studies have demonstrated that p63, a homologue of the cell-cycle regulator TP53, plays a critically important role in regulation of the formation and differentiation of the AER. Two missense mutations, 724A-->G, which predicts amino acid substitution K194E, and 982T-->C, which predicts amino acid substitution R280C, were identified in exons 5 and 7, respectively, of the p63 gene in two families with SHFM. Two additional mutations (279R-->H and 304R-->Q) were identified in families with EEC (ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial cleft) syndrome. All four mutations are found in exons that fall within the DNA-binding domain of p63. The two amino acids mutated in the families with SHFM appear to be primarily involved in maintenance of the overall structure of the domain, in contrast to the p63 mutations responsible for EEC syndrome, which reside in amino acid residues that directly interact with the DNA.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
10769282,Dilated cardiomyopathy and sensorineural hearing loss: a heritable syndrome that maps to 6q23-24.,"BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) are prevalent disorders that occur alone or as components of complex multisystem syndromes. Multiple genetic loci have been identified that, when mutated, cause DCM or SNHL. However, the isolated coinheritance of these phenotypes has not been previously recognized. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical evaluations of 2 kindreds demonstrated autosomal-dominant transmission and age-related penetrance of both SNHL and DCM in the absence of other disorders. Moderate-to-severe hearing loss was evident by late adolescence, whereas ventricular dysfunction produced progressive congestive heart failure after the fourth decade. DNA samples from the larger kindred (29 individuals) were used to perform a genome-wide linkage study. Polymorphic loci on chromosome 6q23 to 24 were coinherited with the disease (maximum logarithm of odds score, 4.88 at locus D6S2411). The disease locus must lie within a 2.8 cM interval between loci D6S975 and D6S292, a location that overlaps an SNHL disease locus (DFNA10). However, DFNA10 does not cause cardiomyopathy. The epicardin gene, which encodes a transcription factor expressed in the myocardium and cochlea, was assessed as a candidate gene by nucleotide sequence analysis; no mutations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: A syndrome of juvenile-onset SNHL and adult-onset DCM is caused by a mutation at 6q23 to 24 (locus designated CMD1J). Recognition of this cardioauditory disorder allows for the identification of young adults at risk for serious heart disease, thereby enabling early intervention. Definition of the molecular cause of this syndrome may provide new information about important cell physiology common to both the ear and heart.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
11104662,CHRNB2 is the second acetylcholine receptor subunit associated with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.,"Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is an uncommon, idiopathic partial epilepsy characterized by clusters of motor seizures occurring in sleep. We describe a mutation of the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, effecting a V287M substitution within the M2 domain. The mutation, in an evolutionary conserved region of CHRNB2, is associated with ADNFLE in a Scottish family. Functional receptors with the V287M mutation are highly expressed in Xenopus oocytes and characterized by an approximately 10-fold increase in acetylcholine sensitivity. CHRNB2 is a new gene for idiopathic epilepsy, the second acetylcholine receptor subunit implicated in ADNFLE.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; case-report"

Here we report linkage of autosomal dominant ""progressive childhood posterior subcapsular"" cataracts segregating in a white family to short tandem repeat (STR) markers D20S847 (LOD score [Z] 5.50 at recombination fraction [theta] 0.0) and D20S195 (Z=3.65 at theta =0.0) on 20q, and identify a refined disease interval (rs2057262-(3.8 Mb)-rs1291139) by use of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Mutation profiling of positional-candidate genes detected a heterozygous transversion (c.386A-->T) in exon 3 of the gene for chromatin modifying protein-4B (CHMP4B) that was predicted to result in the nonconservative substitution of a valine residue for a phylogenetically conserved aspartic acid residue at codon 129 (p.D129V). In addition, we have detected a heterozygous transition (c.481G-->A) in exon 3 of CHMP4B cosegregating with autosomal dominant posterior polar cataracts in a Japanese family that was predicted to result in the missense substitution of lysine for a conserved glutamic acid residue at codon 161 (p.E161K). Transfection studies of cultured cells revealed that a truncated form of recombinant D129V-CHMP4B had a different subcellular distribution than wild type and an increased capacity to inhibit release of virus-like particles from the cell surface, consistent with deleterious gain-of-function effects. These data provide the first evidence that CHMP4B, which encodes a key component of the endosome sorting complex required for the transport-III (ESCRT-III) system of mammalian cells, plays a vital role in the maintenance of lens transparency.",research-article; review; journal article
8817341,Recessively inherited L-DOPA-responsive parkinsonism in infancy caused by a point mutation (L205P) in the tyrosine hydroxylase gene.,"Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of dopamine. This report describes a missense point mutation in the human TH (hTH) gene in a girl presenting parkinsonian symptoms in early infancy and a very low level of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid in the CSF. DNA sequencing revealed a T614-to-C transition in exon 5 (L205P). Both parents and the patient's brother are heterozygous for the mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression in different systems revealed that the recombinant mutant enzyme had a low homospecific activity, i.e. approximately 1.5% of wt-hTH in E. coli and approximately 16% in a cell-free in vitro transcription-translation system. When transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (A293) cells a very low specific activity (approximately 0.3% of wt-hTH) and immunoreactive hTH (< 2%) was obtained. The expression studies are compatible with the severe clinical phenotype of the L205P homozygous patient carrying this recessively inherited mutation. Treatment with L-DOPA resulted in normalisation of the CSF homovanillic acid concentration and a sustained improvement in parkinsonian symptoms.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
9738775,Epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma with woolly hair and dilated cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND:A new cardiocutaneous syndrome has been noted, characterized by an epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair, and associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. OBJECTIVE:This describes the clinical and histopathologic characteristics of this new syndrome. METHODS:Eighteen patients were examined clinically and histologically from 1970 to 1997. Cardiologic examinations were performed in 12 patients. The cutaneous lesions were classified according to the presence of obligatory and facultative elements of the syndrome. RESULTS:Patients were born with woolly hair. Around the first year palmoplantar keratoderma and the other keratotic elements appeared. The first cardiac abnormalities are exclusively electrocardiographic and occur in asymptomatic patients. In these patients, dilation of the left ventricle together with alterations in muscle contractility are observed. The dilated cardiomyopathy can lead to congestive heart failure and death. CONCLUSION:The association of woolly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma with a histopathologic pattern of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis has not been previously described. Their frequent association with dilated cardiomyopathy defines a cardiocutaneous syndrome. Whenever woolly hair is associated with any kind of palmoplantar keratoderma, a search for possible cardiac abnormalities is recommended.",journal article

Here we expand the clinical implications of this discovery. Notably, we identified 6 children in 5 kindreds exhibiting the co-occurrence of BRCA2 mutations, FA, and early onset acute leukemia. Leukemia occurred at a median of 2.2 years of age in the BRCA2 patients in contrast to a median onset of 13.4 years in all other FA patients in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR; P <.0001). Breast cancer was noted in 4 of the 5 kindreds. Of the 6 children with leukemia, 4 were treated with bone marrow transplantation and 2 are alive at 3 and 9 months after treatment. Our results suggest that BRCA2 testing should be considered in all patients with FA in whom the complementation group cannot be defined or in whom leukemia is diagnosed at or before 5 years of age.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
10896989,[Birdshot retinochoroidopathy],"Birdshot retinochoriodopathy is a bilateral posterior uveitis seen in adults over 45 years of age. The uveitis is associated with moderate vitreal inflammation, vasculides of large vessels, chronic papillitis and the yellow birdshot spots typical of the disease. The disease shows tight linkages with HLA A29 carried by more than 90% of the patients. The visual prognosis depends on the development of complications of the chronic ocular inflammation, particularly crystoid macular edema. These complications lead to lowered visual acuity which becomes a major handicap. Long-term local or general corticosteroid therapy is required and leads to cortico-dependence. An immunosuppressor (cyclosporinA) may be associated. As these treatments cause major morbidity, intravenous immunoglobulins offer a less toxic therapeutic approach. Intravenous immunoglobulins can reduce inflammatory phenomena, providing an interesting alternative for the treatment of birdshot retinochoroidopathy.",journal article; english abstract
18378316,Fundus autofluorescence in birdshot chorioretinopathy.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the characteristics of fundus autofluorescence in birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR). DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen eyes of 8 consecutive patients with BSCR (3 men, 5 women). METHODS: Color and autofluorescence photography and optical coherence tomograms of patients with BSCR seen in a referral practice were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Autofluorescent characteristics in BSCR. RESULTS: The 8 patients ranged in age from 35 to 73 years (mean, 56.9 years). Of the 16 eyes, 11 eyes (69%) of 6 patients had retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy as evidenced by hypoautofluorescent regions. Some of the hypoautofluorescent areas corresponded to the hypopigmented birdshot lesions, but the others did not necessarily show a correspondence. Eight eyes (50%) of 4 patients showed linear hypoautofluorescent streaks along the retinal vessels, most of which corresponded to visible changes at the level of the RPE. Placoid hypoautofluorescence in the macula was seen in 6 eyes (38%) of 3 patients and was correlated significantly with best-corrected visual acuity of 20/50 or less (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Autofluorescence photography demonstrated the RPE atrophy, which was hard to see by other means of investigation. The areas of RPE atrophy did not necessarily correspond to the hypopigmented lesions, which suggested that both the choroid and the RPE can be affected independently. Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in the macula may be an important cause of poor central visual acuity in eyes with BSCR.",journal article

10102904,"Defect in dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, a new inborn error of metabolism: NMR spectroscopy study.","BACKGROUND:A38-year-old man presented with a history of fish odor (since age 5) and unusual muscle fatigue with increased serum creatine kinase. Our aim was to identify the metabolic error in this new condition. METHODS:We used 1H NMR spectroscopy to study serum and urine from the patient. RESULTS:The concentration of N, N-dimethylglycine (DMG) was increased approximately 100-fold in the serum and approximately 20-fold in the urine. The presence of DMG as a storage product was confirmed by use of 13C NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The high concentration of DMG was caused by a deficiency of the enzyme dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH). A homozygous missense mutation was found in the DMGDH gene of the patient. CONCLUSIONS:DMGDH deficiency must be added to the differential diagnosis of patients complaining of a fish odor. This deficiency is the first inborn error of metabolism discovered by use of in vitro 1H NMR spectroscopy of body fluids.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

Recessive mutations in SETX have been described in AOA2 patients.To describe the clinical features of AOA2 and to identify the SETX mutations in 10 patients from four Italian families.The patients underwent clinical examination, routine laboratory tests, nerve conduction studies, sural nerve biopsy, and brain MRI. All were screened for SETX mutations.All the patients had cerebellar features, including limb and truncal ataxia, and slurred speech. OMA was observed in two patients, extrapyramidal symptoms in two, and mental impairment in three. High serum AFP levels, motor and sensory axonal neuropathy, and marked cerebellar atrophy on MRI were detected in all the patients who underwent these examinations. Sural nerve biopsy revealed a severe depletion of large myelinated fibers in one patient, and both large and small myelinated fibers in another. Postmortem findings are also reported in one of the patients. Four different homozygous SETX mutations were found (a large-scale deletion, a missense change, a single-base deletion, and a splice-site mutation).The clinical phenotype of oculomotor apraxia type 2 is fairly homogeneous, showing only subtle intrafamilial variability. OMA is an inconstant finding. The identification of new mutations expands the array of SETX variants, and the finding of a missense change outside the helicase domain suggests the existence of at least one more functional region in the N-terminus of senataxin.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
14736755,Frequency and phenotypic spectrum of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 2: a clinical and genetic study in 18 patients.,"Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) is a newly described autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA) defined by genetic location to 9q34 of three families sharing gait ataxia, oculomotor apraxia and/or elevated alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) levels. We have evaluated 77 families with progressive non-Friedreich ARCA and have identified six families with a phenotype suggestive of AOA2. Linkage was confirmed in all six families, with a maximal lod score of 5.91 at D9S1830. We report the first detailed phenotypic study, including neuropsychological, oculographic and brain imaging investigations, in the largest series of AOA2 patients yet recruited. The mean age at onset was 15.1 +/- 3.8 years. Sensory motor neuropathy (92%) and choreic or dystonic movements (44%) were frequent. Oculomotor apraxia was observed in 56% of patients and characterized by increased horizontal saccade latencies and hypometria. AFP levels were elevated in 100% of the families, making it a useful biological marker. This study shows for the first time that AOA2 can be found in Europe, North Africa and the West Indies, and its relative frequency represents approximately 8% of non-Friedreich ARCA, which is more frequent than ataxia telangiectasia and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1), in our series of adult patients. In adults, AOA2 may be, therefore, the most frequent cause of ARCA identified so far, after Friedreich's ataxia.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
11283793,Transaldolase deficiency: liver cirrhosis associated with a new inborn error in the pentose phosphate pathway.,"This article describes the first patient with a deficiency of transaldolase (TALDO1 [E.C.2.2.1.2]). Clinically, the patient presented with liver cirrhosis and hepatosplenomegaly during early infancy. In urine and plasma, elevated concentrations of ribitol, D-arabitol, and erythritol were found. By incubating the patient's lymphoblasts and erythrocytes with ribose-5-phosphate and subsequently analyzing phosphate sugar metabolites, we discovered a deficiency of transaldolase. Sequence analysis of the transaldolase gene from this patient showed a homozygous deletion of 3 bp. This deletion results in absence of serine at position 171 of the transaldolase protein. This amino acid is invariable between species and is located in a conserved region, indicating its importance for enzyme activity. The detection of this new inborn error of pentose metabolism has implications for the diagnostic workup of liver problems of unknown etiology.",research-article; journal article
30268909,Mutations in TBR1 gene leads to cortical malformations and intellectual disability.,"The advent of next generation sequencing has improved gene discovery in neurodevelopmental disorders. A greater understanding of the genetic basis of these disorders has expanded the spectrum of pathogenic genes, thus enhancing diagnosis and therapeutic management. Genetic overlap between distinct neurodevelopmental disorders has also been revealed, which can make determining a strict genotype-phenotype correlation more difficult. Intellectual disability and cortical malformations are two neurodevelopmental disorders particularly confronted by this difficulty. Indeed, for a given pathogenic gene, intellectual disability can be associated, or not, with cortical malformations. Here, we report for the first time, two individuals with the same de novo mutation in TBR1, leading to a frameshift starting at codon Thr532, and resulting in a premature stop codon 143 amino acids downstream (c.1588_1594dup, p.(Thr532Argfs*144)). These individuals presented with a developmental encephalopathy characterized by frontal pachygyria and severe intellectual disability. Remarkably, 11 TBR1 gene mutations were previously reported in intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Our study supports the observation that TBR1-related disorders range from intellectual disability to frontal pachygyria. We also highlight the need for first-line, good quality neuroimaging for patients with intellectual disability.",journal article
20705278,Nonsense mutations in FAM161A cause RP28-associated recessive retinitis pigmentosa.,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a degenerative disease of the retina leading to progressive loss of vision and, in many instances, to legal blindness at the end stage. The RP28 locus was assigned in 1999 to the short arm of chromosome 2 by homozygosity mapping in a large Indian family segregating autosomal-recessive RP (arRP). Following a combined approach of chromatin immunoprecipitation and parallel sequencing of genomic DNA, we identified a gene, FAM161A, which was shown to carry a homozygous nonsense mutation (p.Arg229X) in patients from the original RP28 pedigree. Another homozygous FAM161A stop mutation (p.Arg437X) was detected in three subjects from a cohort of 118 apparently unrelated German RP patients. Age at disease onset in these patients was in the second to third decade, with severe visual handicap in the fifth decade and legal blindness in the sixth to seventh decades. FAM161A is a phylogenetically conserved gene, expressed in the retina at relatively high levels and encoding a putative 76 kDa protein of unknown function. In the mouse retina, Fam161a mRNA is developmentally regulated and controlled by the transcription factor Crx, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and organotypic reporter assays on explanted retinas. Fam161a protein localizes to photoreceptor cells during development, and in adult animals it is present in the inner segment as well as the outer plexiform layer of the retina, the synaptic interface between photoreceptors and their efferent neurons. Taken together, our data indicate that null mutations in FAM161A are responsible for the RP28-associated arRP.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

14578306,Permanent neonatal diabetes caused by glucokinase deficiency: inborn error of the glucose-insulin signaling pathway.,"Neonatal diabetes can be either permanent or transient. We have recently shown that permanent neonatal diabetes can result from complete deficiency of glucokinase activity. Here we report three new cases of glucokinase-related permanent neonatal diabetes. The probands had intrauterine growth retardation (birth weight <1,900 g) and insulin-treated diabetes from birth (diagnosis within the first week of life). One of the subjects was homozygous for the missense mutation Ala378Val (A378V), which is an inactivating mutation with an activity index of only 0.2% of wild-type glucokinase activity. The second subject was homozygous for a mutation in the splice donor site of exon 8 (intervening sequence 8 [IVS8] + 2T-->G), which is predicted to lead to the synthesis of an inactive protein. The third subject (second cousin of subject 2) was a compound heterozygote with one allele having the splice-site mutation IVS8 + 2T-->G and the other the missense mutation Gly264Ser (G264S), a mutation with an activity index of 86% of normal activity. The five subjects with permanent neonatal diabetes due to glucokinase deficiency identified to date are characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, permanent insulin-requiring diabetes from the first day of life, and hyperglycemia in both parents. Autosomal recessive inheritance and enzyme deficiency are features typical for an inborn error of metabolism, which occurred in the glucose-insulin signaling pathway in these subjects.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
23758760,Prospective investigation of autism and genotype-phenotype correlations in 22q13 deletion syndrome and SHANK3 deficiency.,"22q13 deletion syndrome, also known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, delayed or absent speech, and autistic features. SHANK3 has been identified as the critical gene in the neurological and behavioral aspects of this syndrome. The phenotype of SHANK3 deficiency has been described primarily from case studies, with limited evaluation of behavioral and cognitive deficits. The present study used a prospective design and inter-disciplinary clinical evaluations to assess patients with SHANK3 deficiency, with the goal of providing a comprehensive picture of the medical and behavioral profile of the syndrome.A serially ascertained sample of patients with SHANK3 deficiency (n = 32) was evaluated by a team of child psychiatrists, neurologists, clinical geneticists, molecular geneticists and psychologists. Patients were evaluated for autism spectrum disorder using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-G.Thirty participants with 22q13.3 deletions ranging in size from 101 kb to 8.45 Mb and two participants with de novo SHANK3 mutations were included. The sample was characterized by high rates of autism spectrum disorder: 27 (84%) met criteria for autism spectrum disorder and 24 (75%) for autistic disorder. Most patients (77%) exhibited severe to profound intellectual disability and only five (19%) used some words spontaneously to communicate. Dysmorphic features, hypotonia, gait disturbance, recurring upper respiratory tract infections, gastroesophageal reflux and seizures were also common. Analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations indicated that larger deletions were associated with increased levels of dysmorphic features, medical comorbidities and social communication impairments related to autism. Analyses of individuals with small deletions or point mutations identified features related to SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, including ASD, seizures and abnormal EEG, hypotonia, sleep disturbances, abnormal brain MRI, gastroesophageal reflux, and certain dysmorphic features.This study supports findings from previous research on the severity of intellectual, motor, and speech impairments seen in SHANK3 deficiency, and highlights the prominence of autism spectrum disorder in the syndrome. Limitations of existing evaluation tools are discussed, along with the need for natural history studies to inform clinical monitoring and treatment development in SHANK3 deficiency.",research-article; journal article
20301377,Phelan-McDermid Syndrome,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Phelan-McDermid syndrome is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, absent to severely delayed speech, developmental delay, and minor dysmorphic facial features. Most affected individuals have moderate to profound intellectual disability. Other features include large fleshy hands, dysplastic toenails, and decreased perspiration that results in a tendency to overheat. Normal stature and normal head size distinguishes Phelan-McDermid syndrome from other autosomal chromosome disorders. Behavior characteristics include mouthing or chewing non-food items, decreased perception of pain, and autism spectrum disorder or autistic-like affect and behavior. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of Phelan-McDermid syndrome is established in a proband with typical clinical findings and detection of a heterozygous deletion of chromosome 22q13.3 with involvement of at least part of SHANK3, or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SHANK3 on molecular genetic testing. Individuals diagnosed by chromosomal microarray should have a karyotype to evaluate for the presence of a ring chromosome 22. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Early referral for developmental support / special education; assistive technology for communication, oral-motor therapy to alleviate chewing and swallowing problems; standard treatment of seizures, hearing loss, recurrent ear infection, visual problems, and other identified medical needs. Regular professional dental hygiene, routine brushing, and fluoride treatment are important as enamel may be damaged from persistent chewing. Surveillance: Evaluation by a neurologist for epilepsy or if changes in behavior or regression of skills become evident; monitoring for lymphedema, which may appear in adolescence or adulthood; monitoring for symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) in individuals with ring chromosome 22. Agents/circumstances toavoid: Exposure to high temperatures and extended periods in the sun because of decreased perspiration; exposure to dangers such as sources of excessive heat or cold, sharp objects, or clothes/shoes that are too tight, due to decreased perception of pain. GENETIC COUNSELING:Phelan-McDermid syndrome, caused by a deletion of 22q13.3 that includes at least a part of SHANK3 or a pathogenic variant in SHANK3, is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The deletion may be de novo or the result of a balanced translocation in one of the parents; pathogenic variants in SHANK3 are almost always de novo. Prenatal testing and preimplantation diagnosis for Phelan-McDermid syndrome are possible for pregnancies at increased risk.",book; review
20186804,22q13.3 deletion syndrome: clinical and molecular analysis using array CGH.,"The 22q13.3 deletion syndrome results from loss of terminal segments of varying sizes at 22qter. Few genotype-phenotype correlations have been found but all patients have mental retardation and severe delay, or absence of, expressive speech. We carried out clinical and molecular characterization of 13 patients. Developmental delay and speech abnormalities were common to all and comparable in frequency and severity to previously reported cases. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization showed the deletions to vary from 95 kb to 8.5 Mb. We also carried out high-resolution 244K array comparative genomic hybridization in 10 of 13 patients, that defined the proximal and distal breakpoints of each deletion and helped determine the size, extent, and gene content within the deletion. Two patients had a smaller 95 kb terminal deletion with breakpoints within the SHANK3 gene while three other patients had a similar 5.5 Mb deletion implying the recurrent nature of these deletions. The two largest deletions were found in patients with ring chromosome 22. No correlation could be made with deletion size and phenotype although complete/partial SHANK3 was deleted in all patients. There are very few reports on array comparative genomic hybridization analysis on patients with the 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, and we aim to accurately characterize these patients both clinically and at the molecular level, to pave the way for further genotype-phenotype correlations.

18505557,Deletion 22q13.3 syndrome.,"The deletion 22q13.3 syndrome (deletion 22q13 syndrome or Phelan-McDermid syndrome) is a chromosome microdeletion syndrome characterized by neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, normal to accelerated growth, absent to severely delayed speech, and minor dysmorphic features. The deletion occurs with equal frequency in males and females and has been reported in mosaic and non-mosaic forms. Due to lack of clinical recognition and often insufficient laboratory testing, the syndrome is under-diagnosed and its true incidence remains unknown. Common physical traits include long eye lashes, large or unusual ears, relatively large hands, dysplastic toenails, full brow, dolicocephaly, full cheeks, bulbous nose, and pointed chin. Behavior is autistic-like with decreased perception of pain and habitual chewing or mouthing. The loss of 22q13.3 can result from simple deletion, translocation, ring chromosome formation and less common structural changes affecting the long arm of chromosome 22, specifically the region containing the SHANK3 gene. The diagnosis of deletion 22q13 syndrome should be considered in all cases of hypotonia of unknown etiology and in individuals with absent speech. Although the deletion can sometimes be detected by high resolution chromosome analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is recommended for confirmation. Differential diagnosis includes syndromes associated with hypotonia, developmental delay, speech delay and/or autistic-like affect (Prader-Willi, Angelman, Williams, Smith-Magenis, Fragile X, Sotos, FG, trichorhinophalangeal and velocardiofacial syndromes, autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy). Genetic counseling is recommended and parental laboratory studies should be considered to identify cryptic rearrangements and detect parental mosaicism. Prenatal diagnosis should be offered for future pregnancies in those families with inherited rearrangements. Individuals with deletion 22q13 should have routine examinations by the primary care physician as well as genetic evaluations with referral to specialists if neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, or other systemic problems are suspected. Affected individuals benefit from early intervention programs, intense occupational and communication therapies, adaptive exercise and sport programs, and other therapies to strengthen their muscles and increase their communication skills. No apparent life-threatening organic abnormalities accompany the diagnosis of deletion 22q13.",review-article; journal article
11462174,"Park7, a novel locus for autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism, on chromosome 1p36.","Although the role of genetic factors in the origin of Parkinson disease has long been disputed, several genes involved in autosomal dominant and recessive forms of the disease have been localized. Mutations associated with early-onset autosomal recessive parkinsonism have been identified in the Parkin gene, and recently a second gene, PARK6, involved in early-onset recessive parkinsonism was localized on chromosome 1p35-36. We identified a family segregating early-onset parkinsonism with multiple consanguinity loops in a genetically isolated population. Homozygosity mapping resulted in significant evidence for linkage on chromosome 1p36. Multipoint linkage analysis using MAPMAKER-HOMOZ generated a maximum LOD-score of 4.3, with nine markers spanning a disease haplotype of 16 cM. On the basis of several recombination events, the region defining the disease haplotype can be clearly separated, by > or =25 cM, from the more centromeric PARK6 locus on chromosome 1p35-36. Therefore, we conclude that we have identified on chromosome 1 a second locus, PARK7, involved in autosomal recessive, early-onset parkinsonism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case-report"
12953260,The role of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations in Parkinson's disease.,"Mutations in DJ-1 (PARK7) have been reported in two consanguineous families with young-onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD). This study aims to confirm the presence of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations and determine their contribution in young-onset and more typical later onset Parkinson's disease (PD). The entire open reading frame of the DJ-1 gene was screened by direct sequencing in 185 unrelated YOPD patients and a separate cohort of 190 pathologically proven cases of PD. Ethnically matched controls were screened for all mutations identified. We report a low frequency of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations in our cohort of patients. One homozygous missense mutation and one heterozygous mutation were found in two YOPD samples. In addition, several variants were found in the coding sequence of the gene, which are likely to represent polymorphisms. In one case, the polymorphism was population specific. The reported 14Kbp deletion was not found in any of our samples or controls. We confirm the presence of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations in YOPD and estimate their frequency at approximately 1%. No mutations were found in our cohort of later onset sporadic pathologically confirmed cases, suggesting that DJ-1 mutations may only rarely contribute to the cause of this more typical sporadic form of the disease.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
9096364,Human immune disorder arising from mutation of the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor.,"Profound cellular immunodeficiency occurs as the result of mutations in proteins involved in both the differentiation and function of mature lymphoid cells. We describe here a novel human immune aberration arising from a truncation mutation of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), a subunit of the tripartite high-affinity receptor for interleukin 2. This immunodeficiency is characterized by decreased numbers of peripheral T cells displaying abnormal proliferation but normal B cell development. Extensive lymphocytic infiltration of tissues, including lung, liver, gut, and bone, is observed, accompanied by tissue atrophy and inflammation. Although mature T cells are present, the absence of CD25 does affect the differentiation of thymocytes. While displaying normal development of CD2, CD3, CD4, and CD8 expression, CD25-deficient cortical thymocytes do not express CD1, and furthermore they fail to normally down-regulate levels of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2.",research-article; journal article; case reports
10545951,Mutations in NEUROD1 are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein NEUROD1 (also known as BETA2) functions as a regulatory switch for endocrine pancreatic development. In mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of Neurod, pancreatic islet morphogenesis is abnormal and overt diabetes develops due in part to inadequate expression of the insulin gene (Ins2). NEUROD1, following its heterodimerization with the ubiquitous HLH protein E47, regulates insulin gene (INS) expression by binding to a critical E-box motif on the INS promoter. Here we describe two mutations in NEUROD1, which are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes in the heterozygous state. The first, a missense mutation at Arg 111 in the DNA-binding domain, abolishes E-box binding activity of NEUROD1. The second mutation gives rise to a truncated polypeptide lacking the carboxy-terminal trans-activation domain, a region that associates with the co-activators CBP and p300 (refs 3,4). The clinical profile of patients with the truncated NEUROD1 polypeptide is more severe than that of patients with the Arg 111 mutation. Our findings suggest that deficient binding of NEUROD1 or binding of a transcriptionally inactive NEUROD1 polypeptide to target promoters in pancreatic islets leads to the development of type 2 diabetes in humans.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
11571554,Mapping of a new autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss locus (DFNA30) to chromosome 15q25-26.,Hearing impairment is the most common inherited human sensory defect. Nonsyndromic Hearing Impairment (NSHI) is the most genetically heterogeneous trait known. Over 70 loci have been mapped and a total of 19 genes have been identified. We report here a novel locus (DFNA 30) for autosomal dominant NSHI that we mapped to chromosome 15q25-26 in an Italian four-generation family. The haplotype analysis has identified a critical interval of 18 cM between markers D15S151 and D15S130. This region does not overlap with DFNB16 locus but partially coincides with the otosclerosis (OTS) locus. Localisation of the locus DFNA30 is a first step towards the identification of the gene.,journal article
11574907,"Mutations in the human orthologue of the mouse underwhite gene (uw) underlie a new form of oculocutaneous albinism, OCA4.","Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) affects approximately 1/20,000 people worldwide. All forms of OCA exhibit generalized hypopigmentation. Reduced pigmentation during eye development results in misrouting of the optic nerves, nystagmus, alternating strabismus, and reduced visual acuity. Loss of pigmentation in the skin leads to an increased risk for skin cancer. Two common forms and one infrequent form of OCA have been described. OCA1 (MIM 203100) is associated with mutations of the TYR gene encoding tyrosinase (the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of melanin pigment) and accounts for approximately 40% of OCA worldwide. OCA2 (MIM 203200), the most common form of OCA, is associated with mutations of the P gene and accounts for approximately 50% of OCA worldwide. OCA3 (MIM 203290), a rare form of OCA and also known as ""rufous/red albinism,"" is associated with mutations in TYRP1 (encoding tyrosinase-related protein 1). Analysis of the TYR and P genes in patients with OCA suggests that other genes may be associated with OCA. We have identified the mouse underwhite gene (uw) and its human orthologue, which underlies a new form of human OCA, termed ""OCA4."" The encoded protein, MATP (for ""membrane-associated transporter protein"") is predicted to span the membrane 12 times and likely functions as a transporter.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research-article; journal article"
14722913,Mutations in the MATP gene in five German patients affected by oculocutaneous albinism type 4.,"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is caused by a deficiency of melanin synthesis and characterized by generalized hypopigmentation of skin, hair, and eyes. Due to the hypopigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium, OCA is usually associated with congenital visual impairment, in addition to an increased risk of skin cancer. OCA is a genetically heterogeneous disease with distinct types resulting from mutations in different genes involved in the pathway which results in pigmentation. OCA1 is associated with mutations in the TYR gene encoding tyrosinase. OCA2 results from mutations in the P gene encoding the P protein and is the most common form of OCA. OCA3, also known as rufous/red albinism, is caused by mutations in the TYRP1 gene, which encodes the tyrosinase-related protein 1. Recently, OCA4 was described as a new form of OCA in a single patient with a splice site mutation in the MATP gene (or AIM1), the human ortholog of the murine underwhite gene. The similarity of MATP to transporter proteins suggests its involvement in transport functions, although its actual substrate is still unclear. We screened 176 German patients with albinism for mutations within the MATP gene and identified five individuals with OCA4. In this first report on West European patients, we describe 10 so far unpublished mutations, as well as two intronic variations, in addition to two known polymorphisms.",journal article
14961451,Oculocutaneous albinism type 4 is one of the most common types of albinism in Japan.,"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a complex genetic disease with great clinical heterogeneity. Four different types of OCA have been reported to date (OCA1, OCA2, OCA3, and OCA4). MATP was recently reported in a single Turkish OCA patient as the fourth pathological gene, but no other patients with OCA4 have been reported. Here, we report the mutational profile of OCA4, determined by genetic analysis of the MATP gene in a large Japanese population with OCA. Of 75 unrelated patients that were screened, 18 individuals (24%) were identified as having OCA4; they harbored seven novel mutations, including four missense mutations (P58S, D157N, G188V, and V507L) and three frameshift mutations (S90CGGCCA-->GC, V144insAAGT, and V469delG), showing that MATP is the most frequent locus for tyrosinase-positive OCA in Japanese patients. We discuss the functional melanogenic activity of each mutant allele, judging from the relationship between the phenotypes and genotypes of the patients. This is the first report on a large group of patients with OCA4.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
11807860,Camurati-Engelmann disease type II: progressive diaphyseal dysplasia with striations of the bones.,"We recently found mutations of the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) gene (TGFB1) in 9 families, in which progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease) is segregating [Kinoshita et al., 2000: Nat Genetics 26:19-20]. During the study, we encountered two unrelated girls, aged 17 and 11 years, who had clinical manifestations of the disorder, such as marfanoid habitus, waddling gait, muscular weakness, intense leg pain, flexion contracture of the hip and knee joints, delayed sexual development, increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Radiographic studies in the two girls demonstrated not only diaphyseal dysplasia (cortical thickening of the diaphyses) resembling that of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia but also metaphyseal expansion of the long bones, coarse and thick trabeculae of the long and short tubular bones, striations in the spinal, pelvic, and long bones, and cranial sclerosis restricted to the petromastoid regions. These radiographic changes were overall identical with those seen in hyperostosis generalisata with striations of the bones rather than those in progressive diaphyseal dysplasia. Polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing of all exons and their flanking regions of TGFB1 did not detect any mutations. PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the TGF-beta type 1 receptor gene (TGFBR1) did not demonstrate any aberrant DNA fragments. We concluded from these findings that the two girls we described belong to a unique entity distinct from either of the two disorders.",journal article; case reports
11706389,"A novel locus for familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, on chromosome 18q.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset degenerative disorder characterized by the death of motor neurons in the cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. Despite intensive research the basic pathophysiology of ALS remains unclear. Although most cases are sporadic, approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial (FALS). Mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene cause approximately 20% of FALS. The gene(s) responsible for the remaining 80% of FALS remain to be found. Using a large European kindred without SOD1 mutation and with classic autosomal dominant adult-onset ALS, we have identified a novel locus by performing a genome scan and linkage analysis. The maximum LOD score is 4.5 at recombination fraction 0.0, for polymorphism D18S39. Haplotype analysis has identified a 7.5-cM, 8-Mb region of chromosome 18q21, flanked by markers D18S846 and D18S1109, as a novel FALS locus.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case-report"
10974018,Mutations in the human delta-sarcoglycan gene in familial and sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy.,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Two genes have been identified for the X-linked forms (dystrophin and tafazzin), whereas three other genes (actin, lamin A/C, and desmin) cause autosomal dominant DCM; seven other loci for autosomal dominant DCM have been mapped but the genes have not been identified. Hypothesizing that DCM is a disease of the cytoskeleton and sarcolemma, we have focused on candidate genes whose products are found in these structures. Here we report the screening of the human delta-sarcoglycan gene, a member of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, by single-stranded DNA conformation polymorphism analysis and by DNA sequencing in patients with DCM. Mutations affecting the secondary structure were identified in one family and two sporadic cases, whereas immunofluorescence analysis of myocardium from one of these patients demonstrated significant reduction in delta-sarcoglycan staining. No skeletal muscle disease occurred in any of these patients. These data suggest that delta-sarcoglycan is a disease-causing gene responsible for familial and idiopathic DCM and lend support to our ""final common pathway"" hypothesis that DCM is a cytoskeletalopathy.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
11781404,Familial lipodystrophy associated with neurodegeneration and congenital cataracts.,"BACKGROUND:The lipodystrophies are characterized by loss of body fat and metabolic disturbances, but the CNS is seldom affected. METHODS:An investigation of a family with partial lipodystrophy and neurologic abnormalities included lipid analysis, dual-energy x-ray absorbtiometry (DEXA) for adiposity, insulin resistance, karyotype and other genetic analyses, peroxisomal function, glycosylation pattern of transferrin and thyroglobulin, and muscle biopsy. RESULTS:The propositus, a 28-year-old woman with congenital partial lipodystrophy and cataracts, presented with a spastic-ataxic gait and lower extremity paresthesiae at age 18. Laboratory investigation revealed a type V hyperlipidemia pattern, insulin resistance, and high alpha-tocopherol levels. A similar syndrome in other family members suggested an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. DISCUSSION:The progressive neurologic degenerative condition associated with this autosomal dominant, partial lipodystrophy may be misdiagnosed as MS or spinocerebellar degeneration. Search for a few relevant candidate genes was unrevealing. A genome-wide search to determine the molecular etiology can be undertaken if other similar cases are identified.",journal article

By homozygosity mapping a new locus for the syndrome was assigned to a approximately 30 cM interval between markers D18S78 and D18S866 with a maximum multipoint lod score of 3.1, corresponding to a trans-centromeric region on chromosome 18p11.31-q11.2.

22387996,Mutations in axonemal dynein assembly factor DNAAF3 cause primary ciliary dyskinesia.,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia most often arises from loss of the dynein motors that power ciliary beating. Here we show that DNAAF3 (also known as PF22), a previously uncharacterized protein, is essential for the preassembly of dyneins into complexes before their transport into cilia. We identified loss-of-function mutations in the human DNAAF3 gene in individuals from families with situs inversus and defects in the assembly of inner and outer dynein arms. Knockdown of dnaaf3 in zebrafish likewise disrupts dynein arm assembly and ciliary motility, causing primary ciliary dyskinesia phenotypes that include hydrocephalus and laterality malformations. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii PF22 is exclusively cytoplasmic, and a PF22-null mutant cannot assemble any outer and some inner dynein arms. Altered abundance of dynein subunits in mutant cytoplasm suggests that DNAAF3 (PF22) acts at a similar stage as other preassembly proteins, for example, DNAAF2 (also known as PF13 or KTU) and DNAAF1 (also known as ODA7 or LRRC50), in the dynein preassembly pathway. These results support the existence of a conserved, multistep pathway for the cytoplasmic formation of assembly competent ciliary dynein complexes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
11845408,An autosomal recessive form of bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria maps to chromosome 16q12.2-21.,"Polymicrogyria is a cerebral cortical malformation that is grossly characterized by excessive cortical folding and microscopically characterized by abnormal cortical layering. Although polymicrogyria appears to have one or more genetic causes, no polymicrogyria loci have been identified. Here we describe the clinical and radiographic features of a new genetic form of polymicrogyria and localize the responsible gene. We studied two consanguineous Palestinian pedigrees with an autosomal recessive form of bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP), using linkage analysis. Five affected children had moderate-to-severe mental retardation, developmental delay, and esotropia, and four of the five affected children developed seizures. Brain magnetic-resonance imaging revealed polymicrogyria that was most prominent in the frontal and parietal lobes but involved other cortical areas as well. A genomewide linkage screen revealed a single locus that was identical by descent in affected children in both families and showed a single disease-associated haplotype, suggesting a common founder mutation. The locus for BFPP maps to chromosome 16q12.2-21, with a minimal interval of 17 cM. For D16S514, the maximal pooled two-point LOD score was 3.98, and the maximal multipoint LOD score was 4.57. This study provides the first genetic evidence that BFPP is an autosomal recessive disorder and serves as a starting point for the identification of the responsible gene.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; case-report"
17194196,Palladin mutation causes familial pancreatic cancer and suggests a new cancer mechanism.,"Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease. Discovery of the mutated genes that cause the inherited form(s) of the disease may shed light on the mechanism(s) of oncogenesis. Previously we isolated a susceptibility locus for familial pancreatic cancer to chromosome location 4q32-34. In this study, our goal was to discover the identity of the familial pancreatic cancer gene on 4q32 and determine the function of that gene.A customized microarray of the candidate chromosomal region affecting pancreatic cancer susceptibility revealed the greatest expression change in palladin (PALLD), a gene that encodes a component of the cytoskeleton that controls cell shape and motility. A mutation causing a proline (hydrophobic) to serine (hydrophilic) amino acid change (P239S) in a highly conserved region tracked with all affected family members and was absent in the non-affected members. The mutational change is not a known single nucleotide polymorphism. Palladin RNA, measured by quantitative RT-PCR, was overexpressed in the tissues from precancerous dysplasia and pancreatic adenocarcinoma in both familial and sporadic disease. Transfection of wild-type and P239S mutant palladin gene constructs into HeLa cells revealed a clear phenotypic effect: cells expressing P239S palladin exhibited cytoskeletal changes, abnormal actin bundle assembly, and an increased ability to migrate.These observations suggest that the presence of an abnormal palladin gene in familial pancreatic cancer and the overexpression of palladin protein in sporadic pancreatic cancer cause cytoskeletal changes in pancreatic cancer and may be responsible for or contribute to the tumor's strong invasive and migratory abilities.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
9007102,Wide range in age of onset for chromosome 1--related familial Alzheimer's disease.,"Mutations in three different genes on chromosomes 1, 14, and 21 cause autosomal dominant forms of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Most result in an early-onset phenotype. However, several kindreds of Volga German ancestry have the same chromosome 1 gene mutation and demonstrate a relatively older mean age of onset and include individuals with late age of onset. In these families, the mean age of onset is 54.9 +/- 8.4 years (range, 40-75 years), mean age at death is 65.9 +/- 10.2 years (range, 43-88 years), and mean disease duration is 11.3 +/- 4.6 years (range, 5-23 years). This contrasts with a group of 7 families with chromosome 14 mutations in which the mean age of onset is 44.8 +/- 4.8 years (range, 30-55 years), mean age at death is 52.6 +/- 5.7 years (range, 39-65 years), and mean disease duration is 7.6 +/- 3.2 years (range, 2-17 years). (All means are significantly different in the 2 groups of families, p < 0.005.) In the chromosome 1 families, 7 persons (16%) had an age of onset at or older than 65 years and 22 (54%) survived to age 65 or older versus none in the chromosome 14 families. An example of probable nonpenetrance of disease at age 89 was also found in a chromosome 1 kindred. It is concluded that, unlike the chromosome 14 gene, mutations in the chromosome 1 FAD gene may result in individuals with a late age of onset overlapping with the more common sporadic form of the disease occurring in the general population. In light of the great variability in age of onset in persons with identical mutations, study of the genetic and environmental factors contributing to delayed onset of disease in chromosomal 1 FAD kindreds will be an important area for further investigation. Apolipoprotein E genotype may be one such factor that plays a partial role in this variability.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article"
9450781,Amyloid angiopathy in a Volga German family with Alzheimer's disease and a presenilin-2 mutation (N141I).,"We report the neuropathological features in 6 members of a Volga German family with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease linked to chromosome 1 who had a presenilin-2 mutation (N141I). The most significant feature in this family was the presence of severe or moderately severe amyloid angiopathy in five family members with clinical dementia. The index case with the presenilin-2 mutation had late-onset dementia at age 73 years, died of an acute intracerebral hemorrhage, and pathologically showed severe amyloid angiopathy but only rare neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. That she was apolipoprotein E epsilon2/3 heterozygous suggests that the epsilon2 allele may have exerted a selective protective effect resulting in late onset relatively mild Alzheimer's disease despite severe amyloid angiopathy. This family emphasizes the need for more investigation into the role of presenilin mutations in amyloid deposition, especially in the cerebral vasculature, and the role of these changes in clinical dementia.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; case reports"

Most cases are due to mutations in the PSEN1 gene, whereas mutations in the APP and PSEN2 genes are rare. Mutation analysis of the APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes was performed. We herein report the case of a German EOAD patient with a family history of dementia and a missense mutation at codon 141 (N141I) of the PSEN2 gene. To our knowledge, this is the first German EOAD patient without a Volga-German ancestry and a positive family history for dementia carries the mutation PSEN-2 N141I. The patient came to our clinic for the first time when she was 47 years old. During the following 3 years, her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score dropped from 28 to 0. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was an early symptom that was already present during the first consultation. The concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of tau-protein (1151 pg/ml) was increased, whereas the concentration of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta1-42) was decreased (335 pg/ml). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed only slight changes in the early stage of the disease and positron emission tomography with (18F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG PET) demonstrated glucose reduction left parietal and in the precuneus region.

12032315,From flies' eyes to our ears: mutations in a human class III myosin cause progressive nonsyndromic hearing loss DFNB30.,"Normal vision in Drosophila requires NINAC, a class III myosin. Class III myosins are hybrid motor-signaling molecules, with an N-terminal kinase domain, highly conserved head and neck domains, and a class III-specific tail domain. In Drosophila rhabdomeres, NINAC interacts with actin filaments and with a PDZ scaffolding protein to organize the phototransduction machinery into a signaling complex. Recessive null mutations in Drosophila NINAC delay termination of the photoreceptor response and lead to progressive retinal degeneration. Here, we show that normal hearing in humans requires myosin IIIA, the human homolog of NINAC. In an extended Israeli family, nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss is caused by three different recessive, loss-of-function mutations in myosin IIIA. Of 18 affected relatives in Family N, 7 are homozygous and 11 are compound heterozygous for pairs of mutant alleles. Expression of mammalian myosin IIIA is highly restricted, with the strongest expression in retina and cochlea. The involvement of homologous class III myosins in both Drosophila vision and human hearing is an evolutionary link between these sensory systems.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
11983712,Congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ig is defined by a deficiency in dolichyl-P-mannose:Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl mannosyltransferase.,"Type I congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG I) are diseases presenting multisystemic lesions including central and peripheral nervous system deficits. The disease is characterized by under-glycosylated serum glycoproteins and is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the stepwise assembly of dolichol-oligosaccharide used for protein N-glycosylation. We report that fibroblasts from a type I CDG patient, born of consanguineous parents, are deficient in their capacity to add the eighth mannose residue onto the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. We have characterized cDNA corresponding to the human ortholog of the yeast gene ALG12 that encodes the dolichyl-P-Man:Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichyl alpha6-mannosyltransferase that is thought to accomplish this reaction, and we show that the patient is homozygous for a point mutation (T571G) that causes an amino acid substitution (F142V) in a conserved region of the protein. As the pathological phenotype of the fibroblasts of the patient was largely normalized upon transduction with the wild type gene, we demonstrate that the F142V substitution is the underlying cause of this new CDG, which we suggest be called CDG Ig. Finally, we show that the fibroblasts of the patient are capable of the direct transfer of Man(7)GlcNAc(2) from dolichol onto protein and that this N-linked structure can be glucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

The patient 1 presented with a multisystemic disorder with microcephaly, developmental retardation, convulsions and dysmorphic signs. The isoelectric focusing pattern of the patient's serum transferrin showed the partial loss of complete N-glycan side chains. In skin fibroblasts from the patient, the activity of Dol-P-Man:Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol mannosyltransferase was severely reduced leading to the accumulation of Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol, which was transferred to newly synthesized glycoproteins. Sequencing of the Dol-P-Man:Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol mannosyltransferase cDNA revealed a compound heterozygosity for two point mutations, leading to the exchange of leucine(158) for a proline residue and a premature translation stop with loss of the C-terminal 74 amino acids. The parents were heterozygous for one of the two mutations. Retroviral expression of the wild-type Dol-P-Man:Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol mannosyltransferase cDNA in patient's fibroblasts normalized the mannosyltransferase activity.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

To explore the phenotypic variability associated with SCN1A mutations, 188 patients with a range of epileptic encephalopathies were examined for SCN1A sequence variations by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and sequencing. All patients had seizure onset within the first 2 years of life. A higher proportion of mutations were identified in patients with SMEI (52/66; 79%) compared to patients with SMEB (25/36; 69%). By studying a broader spectrum of infantile epileptic encephalopathies, we identified mutations in other syndromes including cryptogenic generalized epilepsy (24%) and cryptogenic focal epilepsy (22%). Within the latter group, a distinctive subgroup designated as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy had SCN1A mutations in three of five cases. This phenotype is characterized by early onset multifocal seizures and later cognitive decline. Knowledge of an expanded spectrum of epileptic encephalopathies associated with SCN1A mutations allows earlier diagnostic confirmation for children with these devastating disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

PPR-positive patients tended to be younger at first (p=0.072) and second seizure (p=0.049), showed severe intellectual disability (p=0.042), and had more often spontaneous occipital epileptiform abnormalities (p<0.001). Clinical sensitivity was reported in medical files in 22% of patients and by parents in 43% (self-induction 24%). Clinical or EEG proven visual sensitivity was detected in 65% of cases.Sensitivity to visual stimuli is very common in DS and more often noticed by parents than confirmed by EEG. Detection of PPR improves with repetitive tests using accurate IPS protocols.Photosensitivity is an important feature in DS and seems to be a marker of the severity of the disorder. Therefore repeated standardized IPS should be encouraged.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23234485,Ocular manifestations (strabismus: duane syndrome; and retinal nerve fiber hypoplasia) in okihiro syndrome (duane radial ray syndrome).,"Two siblings diagnosed with Okihiro Syndrome (also named Duane Radial Ray Syndrome) associated with ophthalmic manifestation including Duane Syndrome and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) hypoplasia were presented.The first patient (15-years old female) was diagnosed of Duane Syndrome presenting reduction of visual acuity and pale optic discs. She showed a diffuse decrease in the RNFL thickness, mainly in her left eye, retaining the typical RNFL morphology as double hump, demonstrated by OCT and scanning laser polarimetry. Neurophysiology evaluation found a decrease in visual evoked potentials and pattern electroretinogram amplitudes, and an increase of the latency of P100 component. The second patient (12 year-old female) presented with Duane malformation. Both patients underwent a complete ophthalmic evaluation with best corrected visual acuity, visual field examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT), scanning laser polarimetry, visual evoked potentials, pattern electroretinogram, and genetic study.The neuro-ophthalmic evaluation showed a subclinical reduction of RNFL average thickness provided by OCT and an increase of P50 and N95 latency by pattern electroretinogram. RNFL average thickness presented a score reduction in both patients, without typical glaucomatous morphology.Our analyses suggest that Okihiro Syndrome may affect retinal nerve fiber layer development and visual acuity.",research-article; journal article
12843316,"Mutations at the SALL4 locus on chromosome 20 result in a range of clinically overlapping phenotypes, including Okihiro syndrome, Holt-Oram syndrome, acro-renal-ocular syndrome, and patients previously reported to represent thalidomide embryopathy.","We have recently shown that Okihiro syndrome results from mutation in the putative zinc finger transcription factor gene SALL4 on chromosome 20q13.13-13.2. There is considerable overlap of clinical features of Okihiro syndrome with other conditions, most notably Holt-Oram syndrome, a condition in part resulting from mutation of the TBX5 locus, as well as acro-renal-ocular syndrome. We analysed further families/patients with the clinical diagnosis of Holt-Oram syndrome and acro-renal-ocular syndrome for SALL4 mutations. We identified a novel SALL4 mutation in one family where the father was originally thought to have thalidomide embryopathy and had a daughter with a similar phenotype. We also found two novel mutations in two German families originally diagnosed as Holt-Oram syndrome and a further mutation in one out of two families carrying the diagnosis acro-renal-ocular syndrome. Our results show that some cases of ""thalidomide embryopathy"" might be the result of SALL4 mutations, resulting in an increased risk for similarly affected offspring. Furthermore we confirm the overlap of acro-renal-ocular syndrome with Okihiro syndrome at the molecular level and expand the phenotype of SALL4 mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
12812989,Lathosterolosis: an inborn error of human and murine cholesterol synthesis due to lathosterol 5-desaturase deficiency.,"Lathosterol 5-desaturase catalyzes the conversion of lathosterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol in the next to last step of cholesterol synthesis. Inborn errors of cholesterol synthesis underlie a group of human malformation syndromes including Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, desmosterolosis, CHILD syndrome, CDPX2 and lathosterolosis. We disrupted the lathosterol 5-desaturase gene (Sc5d ) in order to further our understanding of the pathophysiological processes underlying these disorders and to gain insight into the corresponding human disorder. Sc5d (-/-) pups were stillborn, had elevated lathosterol and decreased cholesterol levels, had craniofacial defects including cleft palate and micrognathia, and limb patterning defects. Many of the malformations found in Sc5d (-/-) mice are consistent with impaired hedgehog signaling, and appear to be a result of decreased cholesterol rather than increased lathosterol. A patient initially described as atypical SLOS with mucolipidosis was shown to have lathosterolosis by biochemical and molecular analysis. We identified a homozygous mutation of SC5D (137A>C, Y46S) in this patient. An unique aspect of the lathosterolosis phenotype is the combination of a malformation syndrome with an intracellular storage defect.",journal article; case reports
17853487,Clinical phenotype of lathosterolosis.,"Lathosterolosis (LS) is a defect of cholesterol biosynthesis due to the deficiency of the enzyme sterol-C5-desaturase. Only two patients have been described to date, both presenting with multiple malformations, mental retardation, and liver involvement. In addition in one of them pathological examination revealed mucolipidosis-like inclusions on optic microscopy analysis, and peculiar lysosomal lamellar bodies on electron microscopy analysis. This study is focused on a better characterization of the clinical phenotype of LS. We describe a further case in a fetus, sibling of the first patient reported, presenting with neural tube defect, craniofacial and limb anomalies, and prenatal liver involvement. The fetal phenotype suggests the possible occurrence of significant intrafamilial variability in LS, and expands the phenotypic spectrum of the disease. Histological examination of autopsy samples from the fetus and skin fibroblasts from the living sibling suggested that the mucolipidosis-like picture previously reported is not a constant feature of LS, being possibly associated with the most severe biochemical defects, but confirmed the ultrastructural finding of lamellar inclusions. The LS phenotype appears to be characterized by the distinctive association of a recognizable pattern of congenital anomalies, involving axial and appendicular skeleton, liver, central nervous and urogenital systems, and lysosomal storage. This condition partially overlaps with other defects of sterol metabolism, suggesting intriguing pathogenic links among these conditions.",comparative study; journal article; case reports
2309789,Apparent Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome in a child with a previously undescribed form of mucolipidosis not involving the neurons.,"A diagnosis of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome was made shortly after birth in a small-for-dates infant, on the basis of a characteristic face, penoscrotal hypospadias, bilateral postaxial hexadactyly, and bilateral syndactyly of toes 2-3. The clinical course was marked by failure to thrive, severe delay, refractory myoclonic jerks beginning at age 2 months, and increasing hepatosplenomegaly. He developed corneal clouding and increased gingival hypertrophy and died at age 18 weeks. Autopsy disclosed widespread storage of mucopolysaccharides and lipids within the macrophages and, to a lesser extent, parenchymal cells, of all organ systems. There was extensive demyelination of the cerebral white matter, and dystrophic calcification in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. There was no evidence of primary neuronal involvement in the storage. Although the chance concurrence of 2 uncommon diseases is rare, a causal link between the clinical anomalies and the storage disorder cannot be argued convincingly on the basis of one case. Careful pathologic studies of other children who die with clinical signs compatible with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome are indicated.",journal article

This patient presented with a complex phenotype, including multiple congenital anomalies, mental retardation, and liver disease. In the patient's plasma and cells, we found increased levels of lathosterol. The biosynthesis of cholesterol in the patient's fibroblasts was defective, showing a block in the conversion of lathosterol into 7-dehydrocholesterol. The activity of 3beta-hydroxysteroid-Delta(5)-desaturase (SC5D), the enzyme involved in this reaction, was deficient in the patient's fibroblasts.

15580635,Characterization of liver involvement in defects of cholesterol biosynthesis: long-term follow-up and review.,"Inborn defects of cholesterol biosynthesis are a group of metabolic disorders presenting with mental retardation and multiple congenital anomalies (MCA/MR syndromes). Functional and structural liver involvement has been reported as a rare (2.5-6%) complication of the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and it has not been fully characterized. Here, we report on a long-term follow-up study of four patients with SLOS, and one case with lathosterolosis who presented with liver disease and underwent an extensive diagnostic work-up. Reports of liver involvement in cholesterol biosynthesis defects are reviewed. Two main different patterns of liver involvement emerged: progressive cholestasis, and stable isolated hypertransaminasemia. In our series, the first pattern was found in two patients with SLOS and one with lathosterolosis, and the second in two SLOS cases. Cholestasis was associated with early lethality and normal serum gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) levels in SLOS, while possible prolonged survival and high GGT levels were seen in lathosterolosis. Hepatic fibrosis was present in both conditions. Liver biopsy performed in one of our SLOS patients with isolated hypertransaminasemia, showed only mild hydropic degeneration of the hepatocytes. The presence of liver involvement in 16% of the SLOS patients diagnosed at our Center suggests that this complication might have been underestimated in previously reported cases, possibly overshadowed by the severity of multiple malformations. Fetal hepatopathy, cholestasis, and isolated hypertransaminasemia can occur also in other disorders of cholesterol biosynthesis, such as mevalonic aciduria, desmosterolosis, Conradi-Hunermann syndrome, Greenberg dysplasia, and Pelger-Huet homozygosity syndrome. This group of inherited disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with liver disease associated with developmental delay and/or multiple malformations. Periodic liver function evaluations are recommended in these patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article; case reports"
25799227,Brain somatic mutations in MTOR cause focal cortical dysplasia type II leading to intractable epilepsy.,"Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) is a sporadic developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex characterized by dysmorphic neurons, dyslamination and medically refractory epilepsy. It has been hypothesized that FCD is caused by somatic mutations in affected regions. Here, we used deep whole-exome sequencing (read depth, 412-668×) validated by site-specific amplicon sequencing (100-347,499×) in paired brain-blood DNA from four subjects with FCDII and uncovered a de novo brain somatic mutation, mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) c.7280T>C (p.Leu2427Pro) in two subjects. Deep sequencing of the MTOR gene in an additional 73 subjects with FCDII using hybrid capture and PCR amplicon sequencing identified eight different somatic missense mutations found in multiple brain tissue samples of ten subjects. The identified mutations accounted for 15.6% of all subjects with FCDII studied (12 of 77). The identified mutations induced the hyperactivation of mTOR kinase. Focal cortical expression of mutant MTOR by in utero electroporation in mice was sufficient to disrupt neuronal migration and cause spontaneous seizures and cytomegalic neurons. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin suppressed cytomegalic neurons and epileptic seizures. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that brain somatic activating mutations in MTOR cause FCD and identifies mTOR as a treatment target for intractable epilepsy in FCD.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17503326,"A mutation in CCDC50, a gene encoding an effector of epidermal growth factor-mediated cell signaling, causes progressive hearing loss.","We previously mapped a novel autosomal dominant deafness locus, DFNA44, by studying a family with postlingual, progressive, nonsyndromic hearing loss. We report here on the identification of a mutation in CCDC50 as the cause of hearing loss in the family. CCDC50 encodes Ymer, an effector of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated cell signaling that is ubiquitously expressed in different organs and has been suggested to inhibit down-regulation of the EGF receptor. We have examined its expression pattern in mouse inner ear. Western blotting and cell transfection results indicate that Ymer is a soluble, cytoplasmic protein, and immunostaining shows that Ymer is expressed in a complex spatiotemporal pattern during inner ear development. In adult inner ear, the expression of Ymer is restricted to the pillar cells of the cochlea, the stria vascularis, and the vestibular sensory epithelia, where it shows spatial overlap with the microtubule-based cytoskeleton. In dividing cells, Ymer colocalizes with microtubules of the mitotic apparatus. We suggest that DFNA44 hearing loss may result from a time-dependent disorganization of the microtubule-based cytoskeleton in the pillar cells and stria vascularis of the adult auditory system.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
12565911,Recessive POLG mutations presenting with sensory and ataxic neuropathy in compound heterozygote patients with progressive external ophthalmoplegia.,"Autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a mitochondrial disease characterized by accumulation of multiple large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA. We previously reported missense mutations in POLG, the gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma in two nuclear families compatible with autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Here, we report a novel POLG missense mutation (R627W) in a sporadic patient and we provide genetic support that all these POLG mutations are actually causal and recessive. The novel patient presented with sensory ataxic neuropathy and has the clinical triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO). This is the first finding of a genetic cause of Sensory Ataxic Neuropathy, Dysarthria and Ophthalmoparesis and it implies that this disorder may actually be a variant of autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Sensory neuropathy is the initial feature in Belgian compound heterozygote autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia patients, all carrying the POLG A467T mutation, which occurs at a frequency of 0.6% in the Belgian population.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
11154138,Congenital deficiency of vitamin K dependent coagulation factors in two families presents as a genetic defect of the vitamin K-epoxide-reductase-complex.,"Hereditary combined deficiency of the vitamin K dependent coagulation factors is a rare bleeding disorder. To date, only eleven families have been reported in the literature. The phenotype varies considerably with respect to bleeding tendency, response to vitamin K substitution and the presence of skeletal abnormalities, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. In only two of the reported families the cause of the disease has been elucidated as either a defect in the gamma-carboxylase enzyme (1) or in a protein of the vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR) complex (2). Here we present a detailed phenotypic description of two new families with an autosomal recessive deficiency of all vitamin K dependent coagulation factors. In both families offspring had experienced severe or even fatal perinatal intracerebral haemorrhage. The affected children exhibit a mild deficiency of the vitamin K dependent coagulation factors that could be completely corrected by oral substitution of vitamin K. Sequencing and haplotype analysis excluded a defect within the gamma-carboxylase gene. The finding of highly increased amounts of vitamin K epoxide in all affected members of both families indicated a defect in a protein of the VKOR-multienzyme-complex. Further genetic analysis of such families will provide the basis for a more detailed understanding of the structure-function relation of the enzymes involved in vitamin K metabolism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
11868161,"Newfoundland rod-cone dystrophy, an early-onset retinal dystrophy, is caused by splice-junction mutations in RLBP1.","Some isolated populations exhibit an increased prevalence of rare recessive diseases. The island of Newfoundland is a characteristic geographic isolate, settled by a small number of families primarily during the late 1700s and early 1800s. During our studies of this population, we identified a group of families exhibiting a retinal dystrophy reminiscent of retinitis punctata albescens but with a substantially lower age at onset and more-rapid and distinctive progression, a disorder that we termed ""Newfoundland rod-cone dystrophy"" (NFRCD). The size of one of these families was sufficient to allow us to perform a genomewide screen to map the NFRCD locus. We detected significant linkage to markers on the long arm of chromosome 15, in a region encompassing RLBP1, the gene encoding the cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein. Previously, mutations in RLBP1 have been associated with other retinal dystrophies, leading us to hypothesize that RLBP1 mutations might also cause NFRCD. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced all coding exons and splice junctions of RLBP1. We detected two sequence alterations, each of which is likely to be pathogenic, since each segregates with the disease and is predicted to interfere with mRNA splicing. In contrast to some previously reported RLBP1 mutations, which yield a protein that may retain some residual activity, each NFRCD mutation is likely to give rise to a null allele. This difference may account for the severe phenotype in these families and exemplifies the molecular continuum that underlies clinically distinct but genetically related entities.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
12507422,The cardiac mechanical stretch sensor machinery involves a Z disc complex that is defective in a subset of human dilated cardiomyopathy.,"Muscle cells respond to mechanical stretch stimuli by triggering downstream signals for myocyte growth and survival. The molecular components of the muscle stretch sensor are unknown, and their role in muscle disease is unclear. Here, we present biophysical/biochemical studies in muscle LIM protein (MLP) deficient cardiac muscle that support a selective role for this Z disc protein in mechanical stretch sensing. MLP interacts with and colocalizes with telethonin (T-cap), a titin interacting protein. Further, a human MLP mutation (W4R) associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) results in a marked defect in T-cap interaction/localization. We propose that a Z disc MLP/T-cap complex is a key component of the in vivo cardiomyocyte stretch sensor machinery, and that defects in the complex can lead to human DCM and associated heart failure.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
14567970,Mutations in the muscle LIM protein and alpha-actinin-2 genes in dilated cardiomyopathy and endocardial fibroelastosis.,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Two genes have been identified for the X-linked forms (dystrophin and tafazzin), while mutations in multiple genes cause autosomal dominant DCM. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a member of the cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family and has been implicated in both myogenesis and sarcomere assembly. In the latter role, it binds zyxin and alpha-actinin, both of which are involved in actin organization. An MLP-deficient mouse has been described; these mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Based upon these data, and the recent descriptions of mutations in MLP in patients with DCM or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we screened patients for mutations in the MLP and alpha-actinin-2 genes. We identified a patient with DCM and EFE, having a mutation in MLP with the residue lysine 69 substituted by arginine (K69R). This is within a highly conserved region adjacent to the first LIM domain involved in alpha-actinin binding. Analysis in cell culture systems demonstrated that the mutation abolishes the interaction between MLP and alpha-actinin-2 and the cellular localization of MLP was altered. In another individual with DCM, a W4R mutation was identified. However, this mutation did not segregate with disease in this family. In another patient with DCM, a Q9R mutation was identified in alpha-actinin-2. This mutation also disrupted the interaction with MLP and appeared to inhibit alpha-actinin function in cultured cells, in respect to the nuclear localization of actinin and the initiation of cellular differentiation.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
11982762,Frameshift mutation in the V2 domain of human keratin 1 results in striate palmoplantar keratoderma.,"The striate form of palmoplantar keratoderma is a rare autosomal dominant disorder affecting palm and sole skin. Genetic heterogeneity of striate palmoplantar keratoderma has been demonstrated with pathogenic mutations in the desmosomal proteins desmoplakin and desmoglein 1. We have studied a four-generation family of British descent with striate palmoplantar keratoderma. Ultrastructural studies show that intermediate filaments of suprabasal keratinocytes are finer than those of the basal layer. In addition, desmosome numbers are normal, but their inner plaques and midline structures are attenuated. Microsatellite markers were used to screen candidate loci including the epidermal differentiation complex on 1q, the desmoplakin locus on 6p, the type I and II keratin gene clusters on chromosomes 12q and 17q, and the desmosomal cadherin gene cluster on chromosome 18q. Significant genetic linkage to chromosome 12q was observed using marker D12S368, with a maximum two-point lod score of 3.496 at a recombination fraction of 0. Direct sequencing of the keratin 1 gene revealed a frameshift mutation in exon 9 that leads to the partial loss of the glycine loop motif in the V2 domain and the gain of a novel 70 amino acid peptide. Using expression studies we show that the V2 domain is essential for normal function of keratin intermediate filaments.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
12637671,Pyogenic bacterial infections in humans with IRAK-4 deficiency.,"Members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) superfamily share an intracytoplasmic Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which mediates recruitment of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) complex via TIR-containing adapter molecules. We describe three unrelated children with inherited IRAK-4 deficiency. Their blood and fibroblast cells did not activate nuclear factor kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and failed to induce downstream cytokines in response to any of the known ligands of TIR-bearing receptors. The otherwise healthy children developed infections caused by pyogenic bacteria. These findings suggest that, in humans, the TIR-IRAK signaling pathway is crucial for protective immunity against specific bacteria but is redundant against most other microorganisms.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18358451,Mutations in the GIGYF2 (TNRC15) gene at the PARK11 locus in familial Parkinson disease.,"The genetic basis for association of the PARK11 region of chromosome 2 with familial Parkinson disease (PD) is unknown. This study examined the GIGYF2 (Grb10-Interacting GYF Protein-2) (TNRC15) gene, which contains the PARK11 microsatellite marker with the highest linkage score (D2S206, LOD 5.14). The 27 coding exons of the GIGYF2 gene were sequenced in 123 Italian and 126 French patients with familial PD, plus 131 Italian and 96 French controls. A total of seven different GIGYF2 missense mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions were present in 12 unrelated PD index patients (4.8%) and not in controls. Three amino acid insertions or deletions were found in four other index patients and absent in controls. Specific exon sequencing showed that these ten sequence changes were absent from a further 91 controls. In four families with amino acid substitutions in which at least one other PD case was available, the GIGYF2 mutations (Asn56Ser, Thr112Ala, and Asp606Glu) segregated with PD. There were, however, two unaffected carriers in one family, suggesting age-dependent or incomplete penetrance. One index case (PD onset age 33) inherited a GIGYF2 mutation (Ile278Val) from her affected father (PD onset age 66) and a previously described PD-linked mutation in the LRRK2 gene (Ile1371Val) from her affected mother (PD onset age 61). The earlier onset and severe clinical course in the index patient suggest additive effects of the GIGYF2 and LRRK2 mutations. These data strongly support GIGYF2 as a PARK11 gene with a causal role in familial PD.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17713465,Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in a patient homozygous for a CD2AP mutation.,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histologic diagnosis in several kidney diseases characterized by proteinuria and a severe decrease in kidney function. Mutations in several genes were found in patients with primary FSGS, one of which is a CD2-associated protein CD2AP (originally referred to as CMS). This gene encodes an adaptor protein that plays a role in endocytosis, cell motility, and cell survival. Mice deficient in Cd2ap (the mouse homolog) die due to kidney failure, while heterozygous mice develop lesions similar to those of FSGS patients. In the kidney, CD2AP regulates the actin cytoskeleton. The only previously described patient with CD2AP mutation had a severely truncated protein. In this study, we describe a patient with a novel mutation resulting in a premature stop codon yielding a protein truncated by only 4%. This shortened CD2AP protein displays a significantly decreased F-actin binding efficiency in vitro with no expression of the mutated allele in the patient's lymphocytes. Heterozygous expression of the CD2AP mutation in both parents did not lead to any kidney pathology, as both have normal glomerular filtration rates and no proteinuria.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

22152683,Disruption of teashirt zinc finger homeobox 1 is associated with congenital aural atresia in humans.,"Congenital aural atresia (CAA) can occur as an isolated congenital malformation or in the context of a number of monogenic and chromosomal syndromes. CAA is frequently seen in individuals with an 18q deletion, which is characterized by intellectual disability, reduced white-matter myelination, foot deformities, and distinctive facial features. Previous work has indicated that a critical region for CAA is located in 18q22.3. We studied four individuals (from two families) with CAA and other features suggestive of an 18q deletion, and we detected overlapping microdeletions in 18q22.3 in both families. The minimal region of deletion overlap (72.9-73.4 Mb) contained only one known gene, TSHZ1, which was recently shown to be important for murine middle-ear development. Sequence analysis of the coding exons in TSHZ1 in a cohort of 11 individuals with isolated, nonsyndromic bilateral CAA revealed two mutations, c.723G>A (p.Trp241X) and c.946_947delinsA (p.Pro316ThrfsX16), and both mutations predicted a loss of function. Together, these results demonstrate that hemizygosity of TSHZ1 leads to congenital aural atresia as a result of haploinsufficiency.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
18245432,Further delineation of deletion 1p36 syndrome in 60 patients: a recognizable phenotype and common cause of developmental delay and mental retardation.,"OBJECTIVES: Deletion 1p36 syndrome is a recently delineated disorder, considered to be the most common subtelomeric microdeletion syndrome (1 in 5000 newborns). 1p36.3 deletions account for 0.5% to 1.2% of idiopathic mental retardation; thus, knowledge about the condition is important for pediatricians caring for such patients. Despite 100 reported cases, little is known about its natural history. Our aim was to delineate the natural history of deletion 1p36 and develop complete and accurate information with which to answer families' questions in the clinical setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 60 patients with the 1p36 deletion syndrome (41 female, 19 male). All underwent physical and neurologic assessments, and most received a psychological evaluation. Standard cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization of the subtelomeric regions, or array comparative genomic hybridization were used for diagnosis. RESULTS: Fourteen cases were detected by standard cytogenetics, and 46 were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization of the subtelomeric regions or array comparative genomic hybridization. Occipitofrontal circumference was at < or = 2nd centile in 95%, and height and weight ranged between the < 3rd and 90th centiles. All patients had straight eyebrows, deep-set eyes, midface hypoplasia, broad nasal root/bridge, long philtrum, and pointed chin. Other features included microbrachycephaly (65%), epicanthus (50%), large, late-closing anterior fontanel (77%), and posteriorly rotated, low-set, abnormal ears (40%). Brachy/camptodactyly and short feet were prominent. Seventy-one percent exhibited heart defects, including 23% with a ""noncompaction cardiomyopathy."" Fifty-two percent had eye/visual abnormalities, and 64% had visual inattentiveness. Twenty-eight percent had sensorineural deafness, 41% had skeletal anomalies, 25% had abnormal genitalia, and 22% had renal abnormalities. Eighty-eight percent had central nervous system anomalies, and 44% had seizures. All patients demonstrated developmental delay with poor/absent speech; 95% had hypotonia. Twenty-six percent were able to walk alone, and 47% had a behavior disorder. Constant developmental progress was observed in all cases over time. Noncompaction cardiomyopathy and most seizures were controlled by pharmacotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These 60 patients with deletion 1p36 represent the largest clinical series to date and provide new information on several aspects of this disorder, which is characterized by neurodevelopmental disability and a recognizable pattern of malformation.",journal article

This contiguous gene deletion syndrome is presumably caused by haploinsufficiency of a number of genes. We have constructed a contig of overlapping large-insert clones for the most distal 10.5 Mb of 1p36, evaluated the deletion sizes in 61 subjects with monosomy 1p36 from 60 families, and created a natural deletion panel. We found pure terminal deletions, interstitial deletions, derivative chromosomes, and more complex rearrangements. Breakpoints were ""binned"" into 0.5-Mb regions. Analyses revealed some clustering of breakpoints but no single common breakpoint. Determination of the parental origin showed that 60% of de novo 1p36 terminal deletions arose from the maternally inherited chromosome. Of the 61 subjects, 30 were examined systematically through a protocol at the Texas Children's Hospital General Clinical Research Center. Specifically, we report hearing evaluations, palatal and ophthalmological examinations, echocardiograms, neurological assessments, and thyroid function tests. To our knowledge, this systematic molecular and clinical characterization of monosomy 1p36 is the largest and most comprehensive study of this deletion syndrome to date.

Monosomy 1p36 is associated with mental retardation, developmental delay, hearing impairment, seizures, growth impairment, hypotonia, and heart defects. The syndrome is also characterized by several distinct dysmorphic features, including large anterior fontanels, microcephaly, brachycephaly, deep-set eyes, flat nose and nasal bridge, and pointed chin. Several genes have been proposed as causative for individual features of the phenotype. In addition, based upon molecular characterization of subjects with monosomy 1p36, several mechanisms for the generation and stabilization of terminal deletions have been proposed.",review; journal article
10507720,Monosomy 1p36.,"We have reviewed published reports on patients with segmental aneusomy for chromosome 1p36 to help geneticists and other health professionals in the recognition of this emerging chromosomal syndrome. Terminal deletions of the short arm of chromosome 1 are associated with hypotonia and developmental delay (usually severe), growth abnormalities (growth retardation, microcephaly, obesity), and craniofacial dysmorphism with a large anterior fontanelle, prominent forehead, deep set eyes, flat nasal bridge and midface hypoplasia, ear asymmetry, a pointed chin, and orofacial clefting. Minor cardiac malformations, cardiomyopathy, seizures, and ventricular dilatation are the more common additional findings. Sensorineural hearing loss and variable ophthalmological anomalies have also been frequently observed. Although the deletions can be detected by high resolution cytogenetic studies, confirmation by fluorescence in situ hybridisation is required in most cases. The majority of deletions are maternally derived. Molecular characterisation of 1p36 deletions has been undertaken in several cases, and it is likely that this condition is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome.",review-article; review; journal article
18031548,Spectrum of epilepsy in terminal 1p36 deletion syndrome.,"PURPOSE: Previous reports have summarized the seizures types occurring in 1p36 deletion syndrome. To better define the spectrum of epilepsy, we studied 91 patients (median age 7.8 years) with confirmed 1p36 deletion. METHODS: Based on clinical charts, we retrospectively analyzed the evolution of both the EEG findings and seizures. RESULTS: Epilepsy occurred in 53 patients (58.2%), with onset at a median 2.75 months. First seizures were generalized tonic (8 cases), tonic and clonic (6) or myoclonic (12), simple partial (6), or complex partial (14). Thereafter, 20 patients (21.9%) developed infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia, at a median age of 5 months. High doses of oral steroids were tried in nine cases, with a prompt remission of seizures in six. Among them, five were seizure-free at the time of evaluation. Conversely, two of three nonresponders to steroids developed severe and refractory epilepsy. At the time of evaluation, 32 patients were seizure-free, from a median age of 1.8 years. Nineteen patients (20.9%) had developed refractory epilepsy with polymorphic seizures, including generalized tonic and tonic-clonic seizures (13) combined with myoclonic seizures (11) and atypical absences (3), atonic seizures (2), or complex partial seizures (3). The EEG showed focal, multifocal or generalized spikes, polyspike, and waves, with poverty of the usual background rhythmic activities. CONCLUSIONS: Early epilepsy is a frequent finding in 1p36 deletion syndrome with infantile spasms as of the most common features that can contribute to a poor clinical outcome. Early diagnosis and management of infantile spasm in this condition is mandatory.",comparative study; journal article
20034100,Extending the phenotype of monosomy 1p36 syndrome and mapping of a critical region for obesity and hyperphagia.,"Rearrangements of 1p36 are the most frequently detected abnormalities in diagnostic testing for chromosomal cryptic imbalances and include variably sized simple terminal deletions, derivative chromosomes, interstitial deletions, and complex rearrangements. These rearrangements result in the specific pattern of malformation and neurodevelopmental disabilities that characterizes monosomy 1p36 syndrome. Thus far, no individual gene within this region has been conclusively determined to be causative of any component of the phenotype. Nor is it known if the rearrangements convey phenotypes via a haploinsufficiency mechanism or through a position effect. We have used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to screen for deletions of 1p36 in a group of 154 hyperphagic and overweight/obese, PWS negative individuals, and in a separate group of 83 patients initially sent to investigate a variety of other conditions. The strategy allowed the identification and delineation of rearrangements in nine subjects with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. Our work reinforces the association of monosomy 1p36 and obesity and hyperphagia, and further suggests that these features may be associated with non-classical manifestations of this disorder in addition to a submicroscopic deletion of approximately 2-3 Mb in size. Multiplex ligation probe amplification using the monosomy 1p36 syndrome-specific kit coupled to the subtelomeric kit is an effective approach to identify and delineate rearrangements at 1p36.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16439973,Mutations in the desmoglein 4 gene are associated with monilethrix-like congenital hypotrichosis.,"The gene encoding human desmoglein 4 (DSG4) was recently cloned, and a mutation in this gene has been reported in several consanguineous Pakistani families affected with localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH). In addition, various mutations in the Dsg4 gene have been identified in animal models of hypotrichosis that share a characteristic phenotype called ""lanceolate hair"". To date, the features of the hair-shaft anomaly in patients with LAH have not been well described. We report a Japanese patient affected with congenital hypotrichosis that was originally diagnosed as monilethrix because she had a hair-shaft abnormality that resembled moniliform hair. However, no mutations were found in the type II hair keratin genes, hHb1, hHb3, and hHb6, whose mutations cause monilethrix. Instead, we identified novel compound heterozygous mutations in the DSG4 gene of our patient. On the maternal allele is a novel S192P transition within the extracellular cadherin II domain of DSG4; on the paternal allele is a novel 2039insT mutation leading to the generation of unstable transcripts. Here we present the observation that mutations in the DSG4 gene can cause monilethrix-like congenital hypotrichosis. Based on our findings, we propose that LAH and monilethrix could overlap.",journal article; case reports
11527955,Mutation of human retinal fascin gene (FSCN2) causes autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.,"PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical features of 14 Japanese patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) who were found to have a mutation in the FSCN2 gene. METHODS: Mutation screening by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) was performed in 120 unrelated patients with ADRP, 200 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP), and 100 patients with simplex RP (SRP). The DNA fragment that showed abnormal mobility on SSCP was sequenced. The clinical features of these patients were determined by visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, electroretinography, fluorescein angiography, and kinetic visual field testing. RESULTS: A novel 208delG mutation in the FSCN2 gene was identified in 14 patients from four unrelated families with ADRP. The ophthalmic findings were typical of RP. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that a 208delG mutation in the FSCN2 gene produces ADRP. This mutation was found in 3.3% of the patients with ADRP in Japan, which suggests that it may be relatively common in Japanese patients with ADRP.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
12794703,14q(22) deletion in a familial case of anophthalmia with polydactyly.,"We report a family of anophthalmia with ocular and extraocular manifestations. The proband, his three sisters, and two sons had anophthalmia and preaxial polydactyly in the right hand. Cytogenetic analysis was done for the proband and two of his sons, one of whom was affected. Another male child was affected but was not available for cytogenetic analysis. Karyotypes of both affected individuals showed deletion on long arm of 14q22q23. Literature review shows four cases of anophthalmia with extra ocular anomalies associated with 14q (q22q23) deletion. Recently it has been suggested that the human homeobox gene, SIX6, and the BMP-4 gene are responsible for eye development. Both are located in the chromosome 14q22.3-q23 region. Deletion in this region has been known to be associated with anophthalmia and pituitary anomalies. This is the first family of anophthalmia, which showed polydactyly with a chromosomal deletion in the 14q22-q23 region and its familial transmission in two generations with a total of six affected individuals.",journal article; case reports
18252212,"Mutations in BMP4 cause eye, brain, and digit developmental anomalies: overlap between the BMP4 and hedgehog signaling pathways.","Developmental ocular malformations, including anophthalmia-microphthalmia (AM), are heterogeneous disorders with frequent sporadic or non-Mendelian inheritance. Recurrent interstitial deletions of 14q22-q23 have been associated with AM, sometimes with poly/syndactyly and hypopituitarism. We identify two further cases of AM (one with associated pituitary anomalies) with a 14q22-q23 deletion. Using a positional candidate gene approach, we analyzed the BMP4 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4) gene and identified a frameshift mutation (c.226del2, p.S76fs104X) that segregated with AM, retinal dystrophy, myopia, brain anomalies, and polydactyly in a family and a nonconservative missense mutation (c.278A-->G, p.E93G) in a highly conserved base in another family. MR imaging and tractography in the c.226del2 proband revealed a primary brain developmental disorder affecting thalamostriatal and callosal pathways, also present in the affected grandmother. Using in situ hybridization in human embryos, we demonstrate expression of BMP4 in optic vesicle, developing retina and lens, pituitary region, and digits strongly supporting BMP4 as a causative gene for AM, pituitary, and poly/syndactyly. Because BMP4 interacts with HH signaling genes in animals, we evaluated gene expression in human embryos and demonstrate cotemporal and cospatial expression of BMP4 and HH signaling genes. We also identified four cases, some of whom had retinal dystrophy, with ""low-penetrant"" mutations in both BMP4 and HH signaling genes: SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) or PTCH1 (Patched). We propose that BMP4 is a major gene for AM and/or retinal dystrophy and brain anomalies and may be a candidate gene for myopia and poly/syndactyly. Our finding of low-penetrant variants in BMP4 and HH signaling partners is suggestive of an interaction between the two pathways in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
10649495,Glucocerebrosidase gene mutations in patients with type 2 Gaucher disease.,"Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disorder, results from the inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Three clinical types are recognized: type 1, non-neuronopathic; type 2, acute neuronopathic; and type 3, subacute neuronopathic. Type 2 Gaucher disease, the rarest type, is progressive and fatal. We have performed molecular analyses of a cohort of 31 patients with type 2 Gaucher disease. The cases studied included fetuses presenting prenatally with hydrops fetalis, infants with the collodion baby phenotype, and infants diagnosed after several months of life. All 62 mutant glucocerebrosidase (GBA) alleles were identified. Thirty-three different mutant alleles were found, including point mutations, splice junction mutations, deletions, fusion alleles and recombinant alleles. Eleven novel mutations were identified in these patients: R131L, H255Q, R285H, S196P, H311R, c.330delA, V398F, F259L, c.533delC, Y304C and A190E. Mutation L444P was found on 25 patient alleles. Southern blots and direct sequencing demonstrated that mutation L444P occurred alone on 9 alleles, with E326K on one allele and as part of a recombinant allele on 15 alleles. There were no homozygotes for point mutation L444P. The recombinant alleles that included L444P resulted from either reciprocal recombination or gene conversion with the nearby glucocerebrosidase pseudogene, and seven different sites of recombination were identified. Homozygosity for a recombinant allele was associated with early lethality. We have also summarized the literature describing mutations associated with type 2 disease, and list 50 different mutations. This report constitutes the most comprehensive molecular study to date of type 2 Gaucher disease, and it demonstrates that there is significant phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity among patients with type 2 Gaucher disease.

10352942,Is the perinatal lethal form of Gaucher disease more common than classic type 2 Gaucher disease?,"In recent years there has been increased recognition of a severe perinatal lethal form of Gaucher disease, the inherited deficiency of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase. We previously reported a case of severe type 2 Gaucher disease which was seen in a medical center in Rotterdam and now present three new cases from two other families seen at the same center. Mutational analyses of these cases revealed two novel mutations, H311R and V398F, located in exons 8 and 9, respectively. The identification of four cases of lethal type 2 Gaucher disease in a single center seems to be a function of increased awareness of this phenotype, rather than of geographic clustering. The actual incidence of lethal type 2 Gaucher disease may be underestimated, as many cases may have been misclassified as collodion babies or hydrops of unknown cause.",journal article; case reports
10685993,Type 2 Gaucher disease: the collodion baby phenotype revisited.,"The association of Gaucher disease, the inherited deficiency of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (EC 3.2.1.45), and congenital ichthyosis was first noted a decade ago. Subsequently, a null allele type 2 Gaucher mouse was generated that also exhibited ichthyotic skin, confirming that the skin disorder and enzyme deficiency were directly related. This paper details the clinical and molecular characterisation of 6 cases of type 2 Gaucher disease presenting with the collodion baby phenotype. The identified mutant glucocerebrosidase alleles include two novel mutations (S196P and R131L) and two rare point mutations (R120W and R257Q), as well as alleles resulting from recombination with the nearby glucocerebrosidase pseudogene. There is significant genotypic heterogeneity in this rare subset of patients with type 2 Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of congenital ichthyosis in the newborn period.",research-article; journal article; case reports
20668259,Frameshift and novel mutations in FUS in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ALS/dementia.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive paralytic disorder caused by degeneration of motor neurons. Mutations in the FUS gene were identified in patients with familial ALS (FALS) and patients with sporadic ALS (SALS) from a variety of genetic backgrounds. This work further explores the spectrum of FUS mutations in patients with FALS and patients with FALS with features of frontotemporal dementia (FALS/FTD) or parkinsonism and dementia (FALS/PD/DE).All exons of the FUS gene were sequenced in 476 FALS index cases negative for mutations in SOD1 and TARDBP. A total of 561-726 controls were analyzed for genetic variants observed. Clinical data from patients with FUS mutations were compared to those of patients with known SOD1 and TARDBP mutations.We identified 17 FUS mutations in 22 FALS families, 2 FALS/FTD families, and 1 FALS/PD/DE family from diverse genetic backgrounds; 11 mutations were novel. There were 4 frameshift, 1 nonsense, and 1 possible alternate splicing mutation. Patients with FUS mutations appeared to have earlier symptom onset, a higher rate of bulbar onset, and shorter duration of symptoms than those with SOD1 mutations.FUS gene mutations are not an uncommon cause in patients with FALS from diverse genetic backgrounds, and have a prevalence of 5.6% in non-SOD1 and non-TARDBP FALS, and approximately 4.79% in all FALS. The pathogenicity of some of these novel mutations awaits further studies. Patients with FUS mutations manifest earlier symptom onset, a higher rate of bulbar onset, and shorter duration of symptoms.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
12682315,Autosomal recessive form of periventricular heterotopia.,"BACKGROUND:Familial periventricular heterotopia (PH) represents a disorder of neuronal migration resulting in multiple gray matter nodules along the lateral ventricular walls. Prior studies have shown that mutations in the filamin A (FLNA) gene can cause PH through an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern. OBJECTIVE:To classify cortical malformation syndromes associated with PH. METHODS:Analyses using microsatellite markers directed toward genomic regions of FLNA and to a highly homologous autosomal gene, FLNB, were performed on two pedigrees to evaluate for linkage with either filamin gene. RESULTS:Two consanguineous pedigrees with PH that suggest an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern are reported. MRI of the brain revealed periventricular nodules of cerebral gray matter intensity, typical for PH. Seizures or developmental delay appeared to be a common presenting feature. Microsatellite analysis suggested no linkage to FLNA or FLNB. CONCLUSIONS:Autosomal recessive PH is another syndromic migrational disorder, distinct from X-linked dominant PH. Further classification of these different syndromes will provide an approach for genetic evaluation.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article; case reports"
25447119,High prevalence of PRPH2 in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa in france and characterization of biochemical and clinical features.,"PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of PRPH2 in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), to report 6 novel mutations, to characterize the biochemical features of a recurrent novel mutation, and to study the clinical features of adRP patients. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical and molecular genetic study. METHODS: Clinical investigations included visual field testing, fundus examination, high-resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence imaging, and electroretinogram (ERG) recording. PRPH2 was screened by Sanger sequencing in a cohort of 310 French families with adRP. Peripherin-2 protein was produced in yeast and analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: We identified 15 mutations, including 6 novel and 9 previously reported changes in 32 families, accounting for a prevalence of 10.3% in this adRP population. We showed that a new recurrent p.Leu254Gln mutation leads to protein aggregation, suggesting abnormal folding. The clinical severity of the disease in examined patients was moderate with 78% of the eyes having 1-0.5 of visual acuity and 52% of the eyes retaining more than 50% of the visual field. Some patients characteristically showed vitelliform deposits or macular involvement. In some families, pericentral RP or macular dystrophy were found in family members while widespread RP was present in other members of the same families. CONCLUSIONS: The mutations in PRPH2 account for 10.3% of adRP in the French population, which is higher than previously reported (0%-8%) This makes PRPH2 the second most frequent adRP gene after RHO in our series. PRPH2 mutations cause highly variable phenotypes and moderate forms of adRP, including mild cases, which could be underdiagnosed.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
10758162,Human neutrophil immunodeficiency syndrome is associated with an inhibitory Rac2 mutation.,"A 5-week-old male infant presented with severe bacterial infections and poor wound healing, suggesting a neutrophil defect. Neutrophils from this patient exhibited decreased chemotaxis, polarization, azurophilic granule secretion, and superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) production but had normal expression and up-regulation of CD11b. Rac2, which constitutes >96% of the Rac in neutrophils, is a member of the Rho family of GTPases that regulates the actin cytoskeleton and O(2)(-) production. Western blot analysis of lysates from patient neutrophils demonstrated decreased levels of Rac2 protein. Addition of recombinant Rac to extracts of the patient neutrophils reconstituted O(2)(-) production in an in vitro assay system. Molecular analysis identified a point mutation in one allele of the Rac2 gene resulting in the substitution of Asp57 by an Asn (Rac2(D57N)). Asp57 is invariant in all defined GTP-binding proteins. Rac2(D57N) binds GDP but not GTP and inhibits oxidase activation and O(2)(-) production in vitro. These data represent the description of an inhibitory mutation in a member of the Rho family of GTPases associated with a human immunodeficiency syndrome.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
14585940,Somatic and germ-line mutations of the HRPT2 gene in sporadic parathyroid carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: We looked for mutations of the HRPT2 gene, which encodes the parafibromin protein, in sporadic parathyroid carcinoma because germ-line inactivating HRPT2 mutations have been found in a type of familial hyperparathyroidism--hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome--that carries an increased risk of parathyroid cancer. METHODS: We directly sequenced the full coding and flanking splice-junctional regions of the HRPT2 gene in 21 parathyroid carcinomas from 15 patients who had no known family history of primary hyperparathyroidism or the HPT-JT syndrome at presentation. We also sought to confirm the somatic nature of the identified mutations and tested the carcinomas for tumor-specific loss of heterozygosity at HRPT2. RESULTS: Parathyroid carcinomas from 10 of the 15 patients had HRPT2 mutations, all of which were predicted to inactivate the encoded parafibromin protein. Two distinct HRPT2 mutations were found in tumors from five patients, and biallelic inactivation as a result of a mutation and loss of heterozygosity was found in one tumor. At least one HRPT2 mutation was demonstrably somatic in carcinomas from six patients. Unexpectedly, HRPT2 mutations in the parathyroid carcinomas of three patients were identified as germ-line mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Sporadic parathyroid carcinomas frequently have HRPT2 mutations that are likely to be of pathogenetic importance. Certain patients with apparently sporadic parathyroid carcinoma carry germ-line mutations in HRPT2 and may have the HPT-JT syndrome or a phenotypic variant.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
14639529,"Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation, a new clinical and genetic disorder caused by RASA1 mutations.","Capillary malformation (CM), or ""port-wine stain,"" is a common cutaneous vascular anomaly that initially appears as a red macular stain that darkens over years. CM also occurs in several combined vascular anomalies that exhibit hypertrophy, such as Sturge-Weber syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, and Parkes Weber syndrome. Occasional familial segregation of CM suggests that there is genetic susceptibility, underscored by the identification of a large locus, CMC1, on chromosome 5q. We used genetic fine mapping with polymorphic markers to reduce the size of the CMC1 locus. A positional candidate gene, RASA1, encoding p120-RasGAP, was screened for mutations in 17 families. Heterozygous inactivating RASA1 mutations were detected in six families manifesting atypical CMs that were multiple, small, round to oval in shape, and pinkish red in color. In addition to CM, either arteriovenous malformation, arteriovenous fistula, or Parkes Weber syndrome was documented in all the families with a mutation. We named this newly identified association caused by RASA1 mutations ""CM-AVM,"" for capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation. The phenotypic variability can be explained by the involvement of p120-RasGAP in signaling for various growth factor receptors that control proliferation, migration, and survival of several cell types, including vascular endothelial cells.",research-article; journal article
14681825,"Mutation of CERKL, a novel human ceramide kinase gene, causes autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP26).","Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the main cause of adult blindness, is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by progressive loss of photoreceptors through apoptosis. Up to now, 39 genes and loci have been implicated in nonsyndromic RP, yet the genetic bases of >50% of the cases, particularly of the recessive forms, remain unknown. Previous linkage analysis in a Spanish consanguineous family allowed us to define a novel autosomal recessive RP (arRP) locus, RP26, within an 11-cM interval (17.4 Mb) on 2q31.2-q32.3. In the present study, we further refine the RP26 locus down to 2.5 Mb, by microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) homozygosity mapping. After unsuccessful mutational analysis of the nine genes initially reported in this region, a detailed gene search based on expressed-sequence-tag data was undertaken. We finally identified a novel gene encoding a ceramide kinase (CERKL), which encompassed 13 exons. All of the patients from the RP26 family bear a homozygous mutation in exon 5, which generates a premature termination codon. The same mutation was also characterized in another, unrelated, Spanish pedigree with arRP. Human CERKL is expressed in the retina, among other adult and fetal tissues. A more detailed analysis by in situ hybridization on adult murine retina sections shows expression of Cerkl in the ganglion cell layer. Ceramide kinases convert the sphingolipid metabolite ceramide into ceramide-1-phosphate, both key mediators of cellular apoptosis and survival. Ceramide metabolism plays an essential role in the viability of neuronal cells, the membranes of which are particularly rich in sphingolipids. Therefore, CERKL deficiency could shift the relative levels of the signaling sphingolipid metabolites and increase sensitivity of photoreceptor and other retinal cells to apoptotic stimuli. This is the first genetic report suggesting a direct link between retinal neurodegeneration in RP and sphingolipid-mediated apoptosis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
10762556,Genomewide search and genetic localization of a second gene associated with autosomal dominant branchio-oto-renal syndrome: clinical and genetic implications.,"Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome is characterized by ear malformations, cervical fistulas, hearing loss, and renal anomalies. It is an autosomal dominant disorder with variable clinical manifestations. The most common features of BOR syndrome are branchial, hearing, and renal anomalies. However, many affected subjects have been observed with branchial-cleft anomalies and hearing loss but without renal anomalies, a condition called ""branchio-otic"" (BO) syndrome. It is logical to question whether the BOR and BO syndromes are allelic or whether they represent distinct genetic entities. We identified a very large extended family whose members had branchial and hearing anomalies associated with commissural lip pits that segregated in an autosomal dominant fashion. Using a genomewide search strategy, we identified genetic linkage, with a maximum LOD score of 4.81 at recombination fraction 0, between the BO phenotype and polymorphic marker D1S2757 in the genetic region of chromosome 1q31. This is the first report of linkage for a second gene associated with BOR syndrome. The findings have important clinical implications and will provide insight into the genetic basis of BOR syndrome.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research-article; journal article"
20978018,A clinical and molecular genetic study of 112 Iranian families with primary microcephaly.,"BACKGROUND: Primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder showing an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Affected individuals present with head circumferences more than three SDs below the age- and sex-matched population mean, associated with mild to severe mental retardation. Five genes (MCPH1, CDK5RAP2, ASPM, CENPJ, STIL) and two genomic loci, MCPH2 and MCPH4, have been identified so far. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we investigated all seven MCPH loci in patients with primary microcephaly from 112 Consanguineous Iranian families. In addition to a thorough clinical characterisation, karyotype analyses were performed for all patients. For Homozygosity mapping, microsatellite markers were selected for each locus and used for genotyping. Our investigation enabled us to detect homozygosity at MCPH1 (Microcephalin) in eight families, at MCPH5 (ASPM) in thirtheen families. Three families showed homozygosity at MCPH2 and five at MCPH6 (CENPJ), and two families were linked to MCPH7 (STIL). The remaining 81 families were not linked to any of the seven known loci. Subsequent sequencing revealed eight, 10 and one novel mutations in Microcephalin, ASPM and CENPJ, respectively. In some families, additional features such as short stature, seizures or congenital hearing loss were observed in the microcephalic patient, which widens the spectrum of clinical manifestations of mutations in known microcephaly genes. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the molecular basis of microcephaly is heterogeneous; thus, the Iranian population may provide a unique source for the identification of further genes underlying this disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
7686693,A novel polymorphism in glycoprotein IV (replacement of proline-90 by serine) predominates in subjects with platelet GPIV deficiency.,"To clarify the molecular basis of the deficiency of glycoprotein IV (GPIV) of the platelet surface, we analyzed GPIV cDNA synthesized from platelet RNA of five unrelated Japanese subjects whose platelets did not express GPIV. We confirmed the presence of normal-sized GPIV mRNA in platelets from subjects with GPIV deficiency. The sequence of platelet GPIV cDNA from GPIV deficient subject showed three differences when compared with the published sequence; 1) a replacement of a 478CCT codon for proline-90 by TCT for serine, 2) a four-base insertion in the 3'-noncoding region, and 3) a substitution of A for 79C in the 5'-noncoding region. The replacement of Pro90 by Ser predominates in subjects with GPIV deficiency; that is, four out of five platelets with GPIV deficiency contained GPIV mRNA encoding GPIVSer-90, while all platelets from 17 GPIV positive subjects had GPIV mRNA encoding GPIVPro-90. The sequence of platelet GPIV cDNA which did not encode GPIVSer-90 from a subject with GPIV deficiency revealed no abnormality in the coding region. The four-base insertion in the 3'-noncoding region and the substitution of A for 79C in the 5'-noncoding region seems to be unrelated to the expression of GPIV. The substitution of Ser for Pro90 might alter the GPIV structure or impair GPIV biosynthesis, resulting in a lack of detectable GPIV. This hypothesis remains to be tested.",journal article
14702087,Defects in RGS9 or its anchor protein R9AP in patients with slow photoreceptor deactivation.,"The RGS proteins are GTPase activating proteins that accelerate the deactivation of G proteins in a variety of signalling pathways in eukaryotes. RGS9 deactivates the G proteins (transducins) in the rod and cone phototransduction cascades. It is anchored to photoreceptor membranes by the transmembrane protein R9AP (RGS9 anchor protein), which enhances RGS9 activity up to 70-fold. If RGS9 is absent or unable to interact with R9AP, there is a substantial delay in the recovery from light responses in mice. We identified five unrelated patients with recessive mutations in the genes encoding either RGS9 or R9AP who reported difficulty adapting to sudden changes in luminance levels mediated by cones. Standard visual acuity was normal to moderately subnormal, but the ability to see moving objects, especially with low-contrast, was severely reduced despite full visual fields; we have termed this condition bradyopsia. To our knowledge, these patients represent the first identified humans with a phenotype associated with reduced RGS activity in any organ.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Missense and protein-truncating mutations were found, and the spectrums of mutations were very similar in the two groups of patients. In the tumors of carriers of biallelic mutations, all somatic APC mutations were G:C-->T:A transversions. In the group with multiple adenomas, about one third of patients with more than 15 adenomas had biallelic MYH mutations. In the polyposis group, no patient with biallelic MYH mutations had severe disease (>1000 adenomas), but three had extracolonic disease. No clearly pathogenic MTH1 or OGG1 mutations were identified.Germ-line MYH mutations predispose persons to a recessive phenotype, multiple adenomas, or polyposis coli. For patients with about 15 or more colorectal adenomas--especially if no germ-line APC mutation has been identified and the family history is compatible with recessive inheritance--genetic testing of MYH is indicated for diagnosis and calculation of the level of risk in relatives. Clinical care of patients with biallelic MYH mutations should be similar to that of patients with classic or attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
9054935,Kerato-epithelin mutations in four 5q31-linked corneal dystrophies.,"Granular dystrophy Groenouw type I (CDGG1), Reis-B端cklers (CDRB), lattice type I (CDL1) and Avellino (ACD) are four 5q31-linked human autosomal dominant corneal dystrophies. Clinically, they show progressive opacification of the cornea leading to severe visual handicap. The nature of the deposits remains unknown in spite of amyloid aetiology ascribed to the last two. We generated a YAC contig of the linked region and, following cDNA selection, recovered the beta ig-h3 gene. In six affected families we identified missense mutations. All detected mutations occurred at the CpG dinucleotide of two arginine codons: R555W in one CDGG1, R555Q in one CDRB, R124C in two CDL1 and R124H in two ACD families. This suggests, as the last two diseases are characterized by amyloid deposits, that R124 mutated kerato-epithelin (the product of beta ig-h3) forms amyloidogenic intermediates that precipitate in the cornea. Our data establish a common molecular origin for the 5q31-linked corneal dystrophies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18179891,Mutations of ESRRB encoding estrogen-related receptor beta cause autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment DFNB35.,"In a large consanguineous family of Turkish origin, genome-wide homozygosity mapping revealed a locus for recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment on chromosome 14q24.3-q34.12. Fine mapping with microsatellite markers defined the critical linkage interval to a 18.7 cM region flanked by markers D14S53 and D14S1015. This region partially overlapped with the DFNB35 locus. Mutation analysis of ESRRB, a candidate gene in the overlapping region, revealed a homozygous 7 bp duplication in exon 8 in all affected individuals. This duplication results in a frame shift and premature stop codon. Sequence analysis of the ESRRB gene in the affected individuals of the original DFNB35 family and in three other DFNB35-linked consanguineous families from Pakistan revealed four missense mutations. ESRRB encodes the estrogen-related receptor beta protein, and one of the substitutions (p.A110V) is located in the DNA-binding domain of ESRRB, whereas the other three are substitutions (p.L320P, p.V342L, and p.L347P) located within the ligand-binding domain. Molecular modeling of this nuclear receptor showed that the missense mutations are likely to affect the structure and stability of these domains. RNA in situ hybridization in mice revealed that Esrrb is expressed during inner-ear development, whereas immunohistochemical analysis showed that ESRRB is present postnatally in the cochlea. Our data indicate that ESRRB is essential for inner-ear development and function. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pathogenic mutations of an estrogen-related receptor gene.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
15034580,ABCC9 mutations identified in human dilated cardiomyopathy disrupt catalytic KATP channel gating.,"Stress tolerance of the heart requires high-fidelity metabolic sensing by ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels that adjust membrane potential-dependent functions to match cellular energetic demand. Scanning of genomic DNA from individuals with heart failure and rhythm disturbances due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy identified two mutations in ABCC9, which encodes the regulatory SUR2A subunit of the cardiac K(ATP) channel. These missense and frameshift mutations mapped to evolutionarily conserved domains adjacent to the catalytic ATPase pocket within SUR2A. Mutant SUR2A proteins showed aberrant redistribution of conformations in the intrinsic ATP hydrolytic cycle, translating into abnormal K(ATP) channel phenotypes with compromised metabolic signal decoding. Defective catalysis-mediated pore regulation is thus a mechanism for channel dysfunction and susceptibility to dilated cardiomyopathy.",research-article; journal article
14988808,Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency: new inborn error in the pentose phosphate pathway associated with a slowly progressive leukoencephalopathy.,"The present article describes the first patient with a deficiency of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) (Enzyme Commission number 5.3.1.6) who presented with leukoencephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain revealed highly elevated levels of the polyols ribitol and D-arabitol, which were subsequently also found in high concentrations in body fluids. Deficient activity of RPI, one of the pentose-phosphate-pathway (PPP) enzymes, was demonstrated in fibroblasts. RPI gene-sequence analysis revealed a frameshift and a missense mutation. Recently, we described a patient with liver cirrhosis and abnormal polyol levels in body fluids, related to a deficiency of transaldolase, another enzyme in the PPP. RPI is the second known inborn error in the reversible phase of the PPP, confirming that defects in pentose and polyol metabolism constitute a new area of inborn metabolic disorders.",research-article; journal article
15042511,Mutations in AXIN2 cause familial tooth agenesis and predispose to colorectal cancer.,"Wnt signaling regulates embryonic pattern formation and morphogenesis of most organs. Aberrations of regulation of Wnt signaling may lead to cancer. Here, we have used positional cloning to identify the causative mutation in a Finnish family in which severe permanent tooth agenesis (oligodontia) and colorectal neoplasia segregate with dominant inheritance. Eleven members of the family lacked at least eight permanent teeth, two of whom developed only three permanent teeth. Colorectal cancer or precancerous lesions of variable types were found in eight of the patients with oligodontia. We show that oligodontia and predisposition to cancer are caused by a nonsense mutation, Arg656Stop, in the Wnt-signaling regulator AXIN2. In addition, we identified a de novo frameshift mutation 1994-1995insG in AXIN2 in an unrelated young patient with severe tooth agenesis. Both mutations are expected to activate Wnt signaling. The results provide the first evidence of the importance of Wnt signaling for the development of dentition in humans and suggest that an intricate control of Wnt-signal activity is necessary for normal tooth development, since both inhibition and stimulation of Wnt signaling may lead to tooth agenesis. Our findings introduce a new gene for hereditary colorectal cancer and suggest that tooth agenesis may be an indicator of cancer susceptibility.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case-report"
15372378,A mutation in the vesicle-trafficking protein VAPB causes late-onset spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders with involvement of upper and/or lower motor neurons, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), progressive bulbar palsy, and primary lateral sclerosis. Recently, we have mapped a new locus for an atypical form of ALS/MND (atypical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS8]) at 20q13.3 in a large white Brazilian family. Here, we report the finding of a novel missense mutation in the vesicle-associated membrane protein/synaptobrevin-associated membrane protein B (VAPB) gene in patients from this family. Subsequently, the same mutation was identified in patients from six additional kindreds but with different clinical courses, such as ALS8, late-onset SMA, and typical severe ALS with rapid progression. Although it was not possible to link all these families, haplotype analysis suggests a founder effect. Members of the vesicle-associated proteins are intracellular membrane proteins that can associate with microtubules and that have been shown to have a function in membrane transport. These data suggest that clinically variable MNDs may be caused by a dysfunction in intracellular membrane trafficking.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
23261302,Exome sequencing identifies mutations in CCDC114 as a cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia.,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal-recessive disorder, characterized by oto-sino-pulmonary disease and situs abnormalities. PCD-causing mutations have been identified in 14 genes, but they collectively account for only ~60% of all PCD. To identify mutations that cause PCD, we performed exome sequencing on six unrelated probands with ciliary outer dynein arm (ODA) defects. Mutations in CCDC114, an ortholog of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii motility gene DCC2, were identified in a family with two affected siblings. Sanger sequencing of 67 additional individuals with PCD with ODA defects from 58 families revealed CCDC114 mutations in 4 individuals in 3 families. All 6 individuals with CCDC114 mutations had characteristic oto-sino-pulmonary disease, but none had situs abnormalities. In the remaining 5 individuals with PCD who underwent exome sequencing, we identified mutations in two genes (DNAI2, DNAH5) known to cause PCD, including an Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation in DNAI2. These results revealed that mutations in CCDC114 are a cause of ciliary dysmotility and PCD and further demonstrate the utility of exome sequencing to identify genetic causes in heterogeneous recessive disorders.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
12634859,A new locus (DFNA47) for autosomal dominant non-syndromic inherited hearing loss maps to 9p21-22 in a large Italian family.,"Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder in humans, and genetic factors are a major cause. Approximately 15-20% of genetic cases exhibit an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission. So far, 41 autosomal dominant loci have been mapped and 17 genes have been identified. Here we report the mapping of a novel locus for autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss, DFNA47, to chromosome 9p21-22 in a large multigenerational Italian family with progressive hearing impairment. Most affected individuals noticed hearing impairment after their teens with subsequent gradual progression to a moderate-severe loss. There were no obvious vestibular dysfunction and other associated abnormalities. A maximum lod score of 3.14 was obtained with marker D9S157 (at theta=0) after a genome wide search. The study of additional markers allowed us to confirm this region with positive lod scores of 3.58 (at theta=0 from D9S285) and of 3.67 (at theta=0 from D9S162). Recombinants define a region of approximately 9 cM flanked by markers D9S268 and D9S942. Multipoint linkage analysis showed a Lod score of 4.26. Few known genes map to the region, and those possibly related by function to hearing are being screened for disease-causing mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
14976160,A mutation in the nerve growth factor beta gene (NGFB) causes loss of pain perception.,"Identification of genes associated with pain insensitivity syndromes can increase the understanding of the pathways involved in pain and contribute to the understanding of how sensory pathways relate to other neurological functions. In this report we describe the mapping and identification of the gene responsible for loss of deep pain perception in a large family from northern Sweden. The loss of pain perception in this family is characterized by impairment in the sensing of deep pain and temperature but with normal mental abilities and with most other neurological responses intact. A severe reduction of unmyelinated nerve fibers and a moderate loss of thin myelinated nerve fibers are observed in the patients. Thus the cases in this study fall into the class of patients with loss of pain perception with underlying peripheral neuropathy. Clinically they best fit into HSAN V. Using a model of recessive inheritance we identified an 8.3 Mb region on chromosome 1p11.2-p13.2 shared by the affected individuals in the family. Analysis of functional candidate genes in the disease critical region revealed a mutation in the coding region of the nerve growth-factor beta (NGFB) gene specific for the disease haplotype. This NGF mutation seems to separate the effects of NGF involved in development of central nervous system functions such as mental abilities, from those involved in peripheral pain pathways. This mutation could therefore potentially provide an important tool to study different roles of NGF, and of pain control.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

Description of an autosomal recessive disorder with a selective reduction of small myelinated nerve fibres and a discussion of the classification of the hereditary sensory neuropathies.,"A Kashmiri family with 3 members affected by a congenital sensory and autonomic neuropathy and corneal opacification is described. The 3 affected cases were offspring of consanguinous marriages in two generations; autosomal recessive inheritance is therefore probable. Pain and temperature sensation was lost in the limbs with a resulting mutilating acropathy. Sudomotor function was also impaired. Motor function, tendon reflexes, kinaesthetic sensation and sensory nerve action potentials were normal. Sural nerve biopsy showed a selectively reduced small myelinated nerve fibre population. Corneal histology revealed neurotrophic keratitis. The classification of the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies is discussed. This family represents a previously unrecognized variant.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
15214000,Phenotype characterization and natural history of spondylothoracic dysplasia syndrome: a series of 27 new cases.,"Spondylothoracic dysplasia (STD, MIM#277300) is an autosomal recessive disorder with high prevalence in the Puerto Rican population. It is generally regarded as a lethal condition. Since Jarcho and Levin described it in 1938, it has been referred to as spondylocostal dysplasia, costovertebral dysplasia, Jarcho-Levin syndrome and STD. We have prospectively characterized 27 patients with STD by detailed physical examination, pedigree analysis, thoracic CT scans, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Diagnoses were established using spinal radiographs and 3-D reconstructive CT scans to demonstrate fusion of the ribs at the costo-vertebral junction with a fan-like (crab-like) configuration of the thorax. Vertebral segmentation and formation defects were seen throughout the spine with a decrease in the number of vertebral bodies. Characteristic vertebral shape consisted of a decrease in antero-posterior diameter and an increase in lateral length, giving the vertebra a sickle shape. Eight out of 18 prospectively follow patients died within the first 6 months of life, a 44% mortality rate. Cause of death was respiratory insufficiency secondary to pneumonia and pulmonary restriction. This is an important finding since the vast majority of STD syndrome patients cited in the medical literature have died in the newborn and early childhood periods. Age of the remaining patients ranged from 4 months to 47 years. This represents the largest collection of patients with STD reported and it has allowed us to determine a detailed phenotype. Given 56% survival at 6 months, we show that STD is not a lethal syndrome.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
26684637,Clinic manifestations in granulomatosis with polyangiitis.,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), is an uncommon immunologically mediated systemic small-vessel vasculitis that is pathologically characterised by an inflammatory reaction pattern (necrosis, granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis) that occurs in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys. Although the aetiology of GPA remains largely unknown, it is believed to be autoimmune in origin and triggered by environmental events on a background of genetic susceptibility.In Europe, the prevalence of GPA is five cases per 100,000 population, with greater incidence in Northern Europe. GPA can occur in all racial groups but predominantly affects Caucasians. Both sexes are affected equally. GPA affects a wide age range (age range, 8-99 years).Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is characterised by necrotising granulomatous lesions of the respiratory tract, vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. Classically, the acronym ELK is used to describe the clinical involvement of the ear, nose and throat (ENT); lungs; and kidneys. Because the upper respiratory tract is involved in 70-100% of cases of GPA, classic otorhinolaryngologic symptoms may be the first clinical manifestation of disease. The nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses are the most common sites of involvement in the head and neck area (85-100%), whereas otological disease is found in approximately 35% (range, 19-61%) of cases.Diagnosis of GPA is achieved through clinical assessment, serological tests for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and histological analysis. The 10-year survival rate is estimated to be 40% when the kidneys are involved and 60-70% when there is no kidney involvement.The standard therapy for GPA is a combination of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. In young patients, cyclophosphamide should be switched to azathioprine in the maintenance phase.A multidisciplinary approach, involving otorhinolaryngologists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, oral physicians, rheumatologists, renal and respiratory physicians, and ophthalmologists, is necessary for the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of GPA. ENT physicians have a determining role in recognising the early onset of the disease and starting an appropriate therapy.",review; editorial
25149391,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener): clinical aspects and treatment.,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis, which affects small- and medium-sized blood vessels and is often associated with cytoplasmic ANCA. GPA occurs in patients between 45 and 60 years old of both genders, and is rarely observed in blacks. The prevalence of GPA increases along a south-north gradient in Europe (20 to 150/million). The main clinical characteristics involve the upper and/or lower respiratory tract and kidneys. Ear, nose and throat manifestations with recurrent sinusitis and crusting rhinorrhea are usually severe. Lung nodules are frequently seen, sometimes excavated. Renal involvement is characterized by rapidly progressive necrotizing glomerulonephritis with extracapillary crescents. Limited forms of GPA predominantly affect the upper respiratory tract, whereas generalized forms of GPA include renal manifestations and/or alveolar hemorrhage and/or vital organ involvement with an altered general condition. The combination of immunosuppressant drugs and corticosteroids has converted this typically fatal illness into one in which 80% of patients achieve remission. However, despite considerable therapeutic progress over the last decades, relapses remain frequent (50% at 5 years), and maintenance treatment is now the main therapeutic challenge.",review-article; review; journal article
22808956,Genetically distinct subsets within ANCA-associated vasculitis.,"BACKGROUND:Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is a severe condition encompassing two major syndromes: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis. Its cause is unknown, and there is debate about whether it is a single disease entity and what role ANCA plays in its pathogenesis. We investigated its genetic basis. METHODS:A genomewide association study was performed in a discovery cohort of 1233 U.K. patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and 5884 controls and was replicated in 1454 Northern European case patients and 1666 controls. Quality control, population stratification, and statistical analyses were performed according to standard criteria. RESULTS:We found both major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) and non-MHC associations with ANCA-associated vasculitis and also that granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis were genetically distinct. The strongest genetic associations were with the antigenic specificity of ANCA, not with the clinical syndrome. Anti-proteinase 3 ANCA was associated with HLA-DP and the genes encoding α(1)-antitrypsin (SERPINA1) and proteinase 3 (PRTN3) (P=6.2×10(-89), P=5.6×10(-12,) and P=2.6×10(-7), respectively). Anti-myeloperoxidase ANCA was associated with HLA-DQ (P=2.1×10(-8)). CONCLUSIONS:This study confirms that the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis has a genetic component, shows genetic distinctions between granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis that are associated with ANCA specificity, and suggests that the response against the autoantigen proteinase 3 is a central pathogenic feature of proteinase 3 ANCA-associated vasculitis. These data provide preliminary support for the concept that proteinase 3 ANCA-associated vasculitis and myeloperoxidase ANCA-associated vasculitis are distinct autoimmune syndromes.

26976020,Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis in Otolaryngologist Practice: A Review of Current Knowledge.,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an idiopathic vasculitis of medium and small arteries, characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. GPA typically affects upper and lower respiratory tract with coexisting glomerulonephritis. This disease is generally characterized by antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA), nevertheless, there are rare cases with negative ANCA. GPA affects people at any age, with predominance of the sixth and seventh decade of life. In 80%-95% of the patients the first symptoms of GPA are otorhinolaryngological manifestations of head and neck including nose/sinuses, ears, eyes, larynx/trachea, oral cavity, and salivary glands. Diagnosis of GPA is based on Criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. In clinical practice diagnosis, the presence of distinctive ANCA antibodies and biopsy of affected organ are crucial. GPA must be differentiated from neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory ulcerative lesions of the head and neck. The standard treatment procedure is divided into two essential phases, induction and maintenance. The induction phase is based on combination of systemic corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy, whereas the maintenance phase comprises corticosteroids and azathioprine/methotrexate supplementation. Surgical treatment ought to be considered for patients who are not responding to pharmacotherapy.",review-article; review; journal article
21885400,Neutrophil chemotaxis in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,"The presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA) implicates the neutrophil as a key effector cell. Previous studies have reported elevated neutrophil counts in the lung, although the determinants of neutrophil chemotaxis in the GPA lung are unknown. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell counts, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and chemokines were measured in 27 patients with GPA, 20 disease controls with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and six healthy controls. CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)8, interleukin (IL)-1β, epithelial neutrophil-activating protein 78, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were measured by ELISA. The neutrophil chemotactic potential of BALF was investigated using the under-agarose method, and specific antibodies were used to examine the role of CXCL8 and IL-1β. GPA BALF had an increased neutrophil percentage, and elevated MPO, CXCL8 and G-CSF concentrations compared with healthy controls. Chemotaxis of control neutrophils towards BALF from patients with active (p=0.006) and remission (p=0.077) GPA, and IPF (p=0.001) patients was increased compared with normal controls. BALF-induced chemotaxis correlated with BALF IL-1β (r=0.761, p=0.001) and CXCL8 (r=0.640, p=0.012) in GPA, and was inhibited by anti-CXCL8 (85%; p<0.001) and anti-IL-1β (69%; p<0.001). Our study confirms a neutrophilia and pro-inflammatory alveolar milieu that persists in clinical remission. CXCL8 and IL-1β appear to play important roles in the neutrophil chemotactic response to BALF.",journal article
10489838,Subclinical alveolar bleeding in pulmonary vasculitides: correlation with indices of disease activity.,"Haemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages are a common finding in patients with alveolar bleeding. Iron-positive macrophages, suggestive of subclinical alveolar bleeding, were found to be fairly common in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in primary systemic vasculitis but uncommon in collagen vascular diseases (CVDs) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To substantiate the impression that subclinical alveolar bleeding may be a feature distinguishing between these disorders, fibreoptic bronchoscopy and BAL were performed in 49 patients with active Wegener's granulomatosis or Churg-Strauss syndrome and 44 patients with CVDs or RA, all of them without clinically manifest alveolar bleeding. The percentage of iron-positive cells was compared with clinical and radiological findings. Only a minority of the CVD and RA patients had iron-positive alveolar macrophages; the 95th percentile of the median number of such cells was 5%. Fifty-three per cent of the patients in the vasculitis group had >5% iron-positive cells, with individual counts ranging up to 95%. Patients with iron-positive macrophages had more extensive disease, more frequent microhaematuria, a higher antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titre, a higher myeloperoxidase concentration in the BAL fluid and somewhat more frequent low-attenuation opacities in pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography than the patients with a low iron-positive cell count. In conclusion, subclinical alveolar bleeding was, indeed, a common finding in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, which distinguished these disorders from lung disease due to collagen vascular diseases or rheumatoid arthritis. Its association with indices of disease activity, although weak in this cross-sectional study, merits a longitudinal study of its value for the long-term monitoring of vasculitis patients.",comparative study; journal article
12021217,Myosin light chain mutation causes autosomal recessive cardiomyopathy with mid-cavitary hypertrophy and restrictive physiology.,"BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by inherited defects of sarcomeric proteins. We tested the hypothesis that homozygosity for a sarcomeric protein defect can cause recessive HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied a family with early-onset cardiomyopathy in 3 siblings, characterized by mid-cavitary hypertrophy and restrictive physiology. Genotyping of DNA markers spanning 8 genes for autosomal dominant HCM revealed inheritance of an identical paternal and maternal haplotype at the essential light chain of myosin locus by the affected children. Sequencing showed that these individuals were homozygous for a Glu143Lys substitution of a highly conserved amino acid that was absent in 150 controls. Family members with one Glu143Lys allele had normal echocardiograms and ECGs, even in late adulthood, whereas those with two mutant alleles developed severe cardiomyopathy in childhood. These findings, coupled with previous studies of myosin light chain structure and function in the heart, suggest a loss-of-function disease mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct mutations affecting the same sarcomeric protein can cause either dominant or recessive cardiomyopathy. Electrostatic charge reversal of a highly conserved amino acid may be benign in the heterozygous state as the result of compensatory mechanisms that preserve cardiac structure and function. By contrast, homozygous carriers of a sarcomeric protein defect may have a malignant course. Recognizing recessive inheritance in children with cardiomyopathy is essential for appropriate family counseling.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
12404107,Systematic analysis of the regulatory and essential myosin light chain genes: genetic variants and mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can be caused by mutations in genes encoding for the ventricular myosin essential and regulatory light chains. In contrast to other HCM disease genes, only a few studies describing disease-associated mutations in the myosin light chain genes have been published. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic screening for mutations in the ventricular myosin light chain genes in a group of clinically well-characterised HCM patients. Further, we assessed whether the detected mutations are associated with malignant or benign phenotype in the respective families. We analysed 186 unrelated individuals with HCM for the human ventricular myosin regulatory (MYL2) and essential light chain genes (MYL3) using polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and automated sequencing. We found eight single nucleotide polymorphisms in exonic and adjacent intronic regions of MYL2 and MYL3. Two MYL2 missense mutations were identified in two Caucasian families while no mutation was found in MYL3. The mutation Glu22Lys was associated with moderate septal hypertrophy, a late onset of clinical manifestation, and benign disease course and prognosis. The mutation Arg58Gln showed also moderate septal hypertrophy, but, in contrast, it was associated with an early onset of clinical manifestation and premature sudden cardiac death. In conclusion, myosin light chain mutations are a very rare cause of HCM responsible for about 1% of cases. Mutations in MYL2 could be associated with both benign and malignant HCM phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15945070,CDG-IL: an infant with a novel mutation in the ALG9 gene and additional phenotypic features.,"We describe the second case of congenital disorder of glycosylation type IL (CDG-IL) caused by deficiency of the ALG9 a1,2 mannosyltransferase enzyme. The female infant's features included psychomotor retardation, seizures, hypotonia, diffuse brain atrophy with delayed myelination, failure to thrive, pericardial effusion, cystic renal disease, hepatosplenomegaly, esotropia, and inverted nipples. Lipodystrophy and dysmorphic facial features were absent. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed volume loss in the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum and delayed myelination. Laboratory investigations revealed low levels of multiple serum proteins including antithrombin III, factor XI, and cholesterol. Hypoglycosylation was confirmed by the typical CDG type 1 pattern of serum transferrin analyzed by isoelectric focusing. A defect in the ALG9 enzyme was suggested by the accumulation of the DolPP-GlcNAc2Man6 and DolPP-GlcNAc2Man8 in the patient's fibroblasts and confirmed by mutation analysis: the patient is homozygous for the ALG9 mutation p.Y286C. The causal effect of the mutation was shown by complementation assays in alg9 deficient yeast cells. The child described here further delineates the clinical spectrum of CDG-IL and confirms the significant clinical overlap amongst CDG subtypes.",journal article; case reports
15148656,Identification and functional analysis of a defect in the human ALG9 gene: definition of congenital disorder of glycosylation type IL.,"Defects of lipid-linked oligosaccharide assembly lead to alterations of N-linked glycosylation known as ""type I congenital disorders of glycosylation"" (CDG). Dysfunctions along this stepwise assembly pathway are characterized by intracellular accumulation of intermediate lipid-linked oligosaccharides, the detection of which contributes to the identification of underlying enzymatic defects. Using this approach, we have found, in a patient with CDG, a deficiency of the ALG9 alpha 1,2 mannosyltransferase enzyme, which causes an accumulation of lipid-linked-GlcNAc(2)Man(6) and -GlcNAc(2)Man(8) structures, which was paralleled by the transfer of incomplete oligosaccharides precursors to protein. A homozygous point-mutation 1567G-->A (amino acid substitution E523K) was detected in the ALG9 gene. The functional homology between the human ALG9 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALG9, as well as the deleterious effect of the E523K mutation detected in the patient with CDG, were confirmed by a yeast complementation assay lacking the ALG9 gene. The ALG9 defect found in the patient with CDG--who presented with developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and hepatomegaly--shows that efficient lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthesis is required for proper human development and physiology. The ALG9 defect presented here defines a novel form of CDG named ""CDG-IL.""","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
16641202,A new intronic mutation in the DPM1 gene is associated with a milder form of CDG Ie in two French siblings.,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) type I (CDG I) are rare autosomal recessive diseases caused by deficiencies in the assembly of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide (DLO) that is required for N-glycoprotein biosynthesis. CDG Ie is due to a defect in the synthesis of dolichyl-phosphoryl-mannose (Dol-P-Man), which is needed for DLO biosynthesis as well as for other glycosylation pathways. Human Dol-P-Man synthase is a heterotrimeric complex composed of DPM1p, DPM2p, and DPM3p, with DPM1p being the catalytic subunit. Here, we report two new CDG Ie patients who present milder symptoms than the five other CDG Ie patients described to date. The clinical pictures of the patients MS and his sister MT are dominated by major ataxia, with no notable hepatic involvement. MS cells accumulate the immature DLO species Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man5 and possess only residual Dol-P-Man synthase activity. One homozygous intronic mutation, g.IVS4-5T>A, was found in the DPM1 gene, leading to exon skipping and transcription of a shortened transcript. Moreover, DPM1 expression was reduced by more than 90% in MS cells, in a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)-independent manner. Full analysis of the DPM2 and DPM3 genes revealed a decrease in DPM2 expression and normal expression of DPM3. This description emphasizes the large spectrum of symptoms characterizing CDG I patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
10642602,Deficiency of dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase-1 causes congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ie.,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), formerly known as carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndromes, lead to diseases with variable clinical pictures. We report the delineation of a novel type of CDG identified in 2 children presenting with severe developmental delay, seizures, and dysmorphic features. We detected hypoglycosylation on serum transferrin and cerebrospinal fluid beta-trace protein. Lipid-linked oligosaccharides in the endoplasmic reticulum of patient fibroblasts showed an accumulation of the dolichyl pyrophosphate Man(5)GlcNAc(2) structure, compatible with the reduced dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase (DolP-Man synthase) activity detected in these patients. Accordingly, 2 mutant alleles of the DolP-Man synthase DPM1 gene, 1 with a 274C>G transversion, the other with a 628delC deletion, were detected in both siblings. Complementation analysis using DPM1-null murine Thy1-deficient cells confirmed the detrimental effect of both mutations on the enzymatic activity. Furthermore, mannose supplementation failed to improve the glycosylation status of DPM1-deficient fibroblast cells, thus precluding a possible therapeutic application of mannose in the patients. Because DPM1 deficiency, like other subtypes of CDG-I, impairs the assembly of N-glycans, this novel glycosylation defect was named CDG-Ie.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
14638541,"Missense mutations and gene interruption in PROSIT240, a novel TRAP240-like gene, in patients with congenital heart defect (transposition of the great arteries).","BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease represents the most common severe birth defect, affecting 0.7% to 1% of all neonates, among whom 5% to 7% display transposition of the great arteries (TGA). TGA represents a septation defect of the common outflow tract of the heart, manifesting around the fifth week during embryonic development. Despite its high prevalence, very little is known about the pathogenesis of this disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a positional cloning approach, we isolated a novel gene, PROSIT240 (also termed THRAP2), that is interrupted in a patient with a chromosomal translocation and who displays TGA and mental retardation. High expression of PROSIT240 within the heart (aorta) and brain (cerebellum) was well correlated with the malformations observed in the patient and prompted further analyses. PROSIT240 shows significant homology to the nuclear receptor coactivator TRAP240, suggesting it to be a new component of the thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein (TRAP) complex. Interestingly, several TRAP components have been previously shown to be important in early embryonic development in various organisms, making PROSIT240 an excellent candidate gene to be correlated to the patient's phenotype. Subsequent mutational screening of 97 patients with isolated dextro-looped TGA revealed 3 missense mutations in PROSIT240, which were not detected in 400 control chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these genetic data suggest that PROSIT240 is involved in early heart and brain development.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

We report the first case of neonatal carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency II detected by expanded newborn screening with tandem mass spectrometry. The neonate presented with dysmorphic facial features, structural malformations, renal failure, seizures, and cardiac arrythmias and died on the third day of life. This experience illustrates the importance of expanded newborn screening to avoid missing a metabolic diagnosis in early infantile death.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
15282353,Mutation of perinatal myosin heavy chain associated with a Carney complex variant.,"BACKGROUND: Familial cardiac myxomas occur in the hereditary syndrome Carney complex. Although PRKAR1A mutations can cause the Carney complex, the disorder is genetically heterogeneous. To identify the cause of a Carney complex variant associated with distal arthrogryposis (the trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome), we performed clinical and genetic studies. METHODS: A large family with familial cardiac myxomas and the trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome (Family 1) was identified and clinically evaluated along with two families with trismus and pseudocamptodactyly. Genetic linkage analyses were performed with the use of microsatellite polymorphisms to determine a locus for this Carney complex variant. Positional cloning and mutational analyses of candidate genes were performed to identify the genetic cause of disease in the family with the Carney complex as well as in the families with the trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome. RESULTS: Clinical evaluations demonstrated that the Carney complex cosegregated with the trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome in Family 1, and genetic analyses demonstrated linkage of the disease to chromosome 17p12-p13.1 (maximum multipoint lod score, 4.39). Sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation (Arg674Gln) in the perinatal myosin heavy-chain gene (MYH8). The same mutation was also found in the two families with the trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome. Arg674 is highly conserved evolutionarily, localizes to the actin-binding domain of the perinatal myosin head, and is close to the ATP-binding site. We identified nonsynonymous MYH8 polymorphisms in patients with cardiac myxoma syndromes but without arthrogryposis. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel heart-hand syndrome involving familial cardiac myxomas and distal arthrogryposis and demonstrate that these disorders are caused by a founder mutation in the MYH8 gene. Our findings demonstrate novel roles for perinatal myosin in both the development of skeletal muscle and cardiac tumorigenesis.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

15354328,"In a Vietnamese population, MSX1 variants contribute to cleft lip and palate.","PURPOSE:To identify causes of nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate in a Vietnamese population. METHODS:In this study, 175 families with at least one case of cleft lip and/or palate were studied using the candidate genes TGFA, MSX1, and TGFB3. RESULTS:Transmission distortion for alleles of MSX1 were demonstrated for the whole population and two missense mutations were identified, including one (P147Q) that is found in approximately 2% of the population. The P147Q appears to arise from a founder individual based on shared haplotypes in unrelated families. CONCLUSIONS:MSX1 contributes to nonsyndromic clefting in a Vietnamese population, and consistent with other studies, identifiable mutations in this gene cause about 2% of cases of nonsyndromic clefting.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
15269314,Missense variations in the fibulin 5 gene and age-related macular degeneration.,"BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss in the developed world. The study of a rare mendelian form of macular degeneration implicated fibulin genes in the pathogenesis of more common forms of this disease. We evaluated five fibulin genes in a large series of patients with AMD. METHODS: We studied 402 patients with AMD and 429 control subjects from the same clinic population. Patients were examined by means of indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit-lamp microscopy, and fundus photography to establish the presence and phenotypic pattern of AMD. DNA samples were screened for sequence variations in five members of the fibulin gene family. RESULTS: Amino acid-altering sequence variations were found in all five fibulin genes, many of which were observed only in patients with AMD. Several of the altered residues have been conserved during evolution. Seven of the 402 patients with AMD had amino acid-altering sequence variations in the fibulin 5 gene, whereas none were observed among 429 control subjects (P<0.01). In addition, these seven patients all had small, circular drusen, which are commonly referred to as basal laminar or cuticular drusen. CONCLUSIONS: Missense mutations in the fibulin 5 gene were found in 1.7 percent of patients with AMD. Many variations in other fibulin genes were also found in these patients, and the evolutionary conservation of the affected residues suggests that several of these variations may also be involved in AMD.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
21576112,"Fibulin-5 mutations link inherited neuropathies, age-related macular degeneration and hyperelastic skin.","To identify the disease-causing gene responsible for an autosomal dominantly inherited Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy subtype in a family excluded for mutations in the common Charcot-Marie-Tooth genes, we used array-based sequence capture to simultaneously analyse the disease-linked protein coding exome at chromosome 14q32. A missense mutation in fibulin-5, encoding a widely expressed constituent of the extracellular matrix that has an essential role in elastic fibre assembly and has been shown to cause cutis laxa, was detected as the only novel non-synonymous sequence variant within the disease interval. Screening of 112 index probands with unclassified Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies detected two further fibulin-5 missense mutations in two families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and hyperextensible skin. Since fibulin-5 mutations have been described in patients with age-related macular degeneration, an additional 300 probands with exudative age-related macular degeneration were included in this study. Two further fibulin-5 missense mutations were identified in six patients. A mild to severe peripheral neuropathy was detected in the majority of patients with age-related macular degeneration carrying mutations in fibulin-5. This study identifies fibulin-5 as a gene involved in Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies and reveals heterozygous fibulin-5 mutations in 2% of our patients with age-related macular degeneration. Furthermore, it adumbrates a new syndrome by linking concurrent pathologic alterations affecting peripheral nerves, eyes and skin to mutations in the fibulin-5 gene.",journal article
16825436,Novel Munc13-4 mutations in children and young adult patients with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.,"Familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterised by constitutive defects in cellular cytotoxicity resulting in fever, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia, and the outcome is fatal unless treated by chemoimmunotherapy followed by haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Since 1999, mutations in the perforin gene giving rise to this disease have been identified; however, these account only for 40% of cases. Lack of a genetic marker hampers the diagnosis, suitability for transplantation, selection of familial donors, identification of carriers, genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. Mutations in the Munc13-4 gene have recently been described in patients with FHL. We sequenced the Munc13-4 gene in all patients with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis not due to PRF1 mutations. In 15 of the 30 families studied, 12 novel and 4 known Munc13-4 mutations were found, spread throughout the gene. Among novel mutations, 2650C-->T introduced a stop codon; 441del A, 532del C, 3082del C and 3226ins G caused a frameshift, and seven were mis sense mutations. Median age of diagnosis was 4 months, but six patients developed the disease after 5 years of age and one as a young adult of 18 years. Involvement of central nervous system was present in 9 of 15 patients, activity of natural killer cells was markedly reduced or absent in 13 of 13 tested patients. Chemo-immunotherapy was effective in all patients. Munc13-4 mutations were found in 15 of 30 patients with FHL without PRF1 mutations. Because these patients may develop the disease during adolescence or even later, haematologists should include FHL2 and FHL3 in the differential diagnosis of young adults with fever, cytopenia, splenomegaly and hypercytokinaemia.","letter; research support, non-u.s. gov't; case-report"
11023514,A partial deficiency of interleukin-7R alpha is sufficient to abrogate T-cell development and cause severe combined immunodeficiency.,"Both in vitro and in vivo studies established that interleukin 7 (IL-7) is essential for differentiation of immature T cells and B cells but not natural killer (NK) cells in the mouse. In humans, although both T-cell and B-cell progenitors express the functional IL-7 receptor that consists of IL-7R alpha and the gamma common (gamma c) chain, this lymphocyte receptor system is critical for T lineage but not for B lineage development. Indeed, complete gamma c deficiency like IL-7R alpha deficiency results in the arrest of T-cell but not B-cell development (T(-)B(+) SCID). However, partial deficiency of gamma c caused by missense mutations results in a T(+)B(+) phenotype and a delay of clinical presentation. It was therefore plausible to assume that partial deficiency of IL-7R alpha, like partial gamma c deficiency may lead to a milder clinical and immunologic phenotype. A P132S mutation in the IL-7R alpha was identified in 3 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) within an extensively consanguineous family. Substitution of proline with serine in the extracellular portion of IL-7R alpha did not affect IL-7R alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression, but severely compromised affinity to IL-7, resulting in defective signal transduction. In response to IL-7 stimulation, Jak-3 phosphorylation was markedly reduced in both patient cells as well as in COS cells reconstituted with mutant IL-7R alpha. Surprisingly, this partial deficiency of IL-7R alpha resulted in a severe phenotype, including markedly reduced circulating T cells while sparing B-cell numbers similar to gamma c chain deficiency. However, unlike the previously reported cases, serum immunoglobulins were virtually absent. Further, unlike gamma c deficiency, NK cell numbers and function was preserved. Despite the partial deficiency, clinical presentation was indistinguishable from a complete gamma c deficiency, including severe and persistent viral and protozoal infections and failure to thrive. Unlike partial gamma c deficiency, a partial deficiency of IL-7R alpha results in an arrest of T-cell development, leading to typical severe combined immunodeficiency. This underscores the critical role of IL-7R alpha chain in the differentiation of T cells. (Blood. 2000;96:2803-2807)","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
19732862,"FREM1 mutations cause bifid nose, renal agenesis, and anorectal malformations syndrome.","An autosomal-recessive syndrome of bifid nose and anorectal and renal anomalies (BNAR) was previously reported in a consanguineous Egyptian sibship. Here, we report the results of linkage analysis, on this family and on two other families with a similar phenotype, which identified a shared region of homozygosity on chromosome 9p22.2-p23. Candidate-gene analysis revealed homozygous frameshift and missense mutations in FREM1, which encodes an extracellular matrix component of basement membranes. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated gene expression of Frem1 in the midline of E11.5 mouse embryos, in agreement with the observed cleft nose phenotype of our patients. FREM1 is part of a ternary complex that includes FRAS1 and FREM2, and mutations of the latter two genes have been reported to cause Fraser syndrome in mice and humans. The phenotypic variability previously reported for different Frem1 mouse mutants suggests that the apparently distinct phenotype of BNAR in humans may represent a previously unrecognized variant of Fraser syndrome.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19429596,Functional evidence implicating FOXL2 in non-syndromic premature ovarian failure and in the regulation of the transcription factor OSR2.,"BACKGROUND: FOXL2 encodes a forkhead transcription factor whose mutations are responsible for the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), involving craniofacial/palpebral abnormalities often associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). RESULTS: We describe a FOXL2 variant (p.Gly187Asp) in a case of POF without BPES. The subcellular localisation of FOXL2-G187D was normal but its transactivation capacity tested on two reporter promoters, one of which should be relevant to the ovary, was significantly lower than that of normal FOXL2. However, FOXL2-G187D was able to activate strongly a reporter construct driven by the promoter of Osr2 (odd-skipped related 2 transcription factor), which we have suggested to be a crucial target of FOXL2 in the craniofacial region. This is compatible with the absence of BPES in our patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence in favour of the implication of FOXL2 variants in non-syndromic POF and confirm the regulatory interaction between FOXL2 and OSR2 whose perturbation might contribute to the palpebral abnormalities observed in BPES patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
12838198,Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency: a severe fatty acid oxidation disorder with cardiac and neurologic involvement.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of presentation, including both clinical and biochemical abnormalities, and the clinical course in a cohort of patients with complete mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) deficiency, a rare inborn error of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. STUDY DESIGN: A questionnaire was sent to the referring physicians from 25 unselected MTP-deficient patients. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients could be included. Questionnaires about four patients were not returned. Nine (43%) patients presented with rapidly progressive clinical deterioration; six (67%) of them had hypoketotic hypoglycemia. The remaining 12 patients presented with a much more insidious disease with nonspecific chronic symptoms, including hypotonia (100%), cardiomyopathy (73%), failure to thrive, or peripheral neuropathy. Ten patients (48%) presented in the neonatal period. Mortality was high (76%), mostly attributable to cardiac involvement. Two patients who were diagnosed prenatally died despite treatment. CONCLUSION: Complete MTP deficiency often presents with nonspecific symptomatology, which makes clinical recognition difficult. Hypotonia and cardiomyopathy are common presenting features, and the differential diagnosis of an infant with these signs should include MTP deficiency. In spite of early diagnosis and treatment, only a few patients with this condition have survived.",multicenter study; journal article
17452773,"Identification of the Fanconi anemia complementation group I gene, FANCI.","To identify the gene underlying Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation group I we studied informative FA-I families by a genome-wide linkage analysis, which resulted in 4 candidate regions together encompassing 351 genes. Candidates were selected via bioinformatics and data mining on the basis of their resemblance to other FA genes/proteins acting in the FA pathway, such as: degree of evolutionary conservation, presence of nuclear localization signals and pattern of tissue-dependent expression. We found a candidate, KIAA1794 on chromosome 15q25-26, to be mutated in 8 affected individuals previously assigned to complementation group I. Western blots of endogenous FANCI indicated that functionally active KIAA1794 protein is lacking in FA-I individuals. Knock-down of KIAA1794 expression by siRNA in HeLa cells caused excessive chromosomal breakage induced by mitomycin C, a hallmark of FA cells. Furthermore, phenotypic reversion of a patient-derived cell line was associated with a secondary genetic alteration at the KIAA1794 locus. These data add up to two conclusions. First, KIAA1794 is a FA gene. Second, this gene is identical to FANCI, since the patient cell lines found mutated in this study included the reference cell line for group I, EUFA592.","other; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Cells from individuals with Fanconi anemia of complementation groups D1 and J (FA-D1 and FA-J) have normal FANCD2 ubiquitination. Using genetic mapping, mutation identification and western-blot data, we identify the defective protein in FA-J cells as BRIP1 (also called BACH1), a DNA helicase that is a binding partner of the breast cancer tumor suppressor BRCA1.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
15265795,"CD151, the first member of the tetraspanin (TM4) superfamily detected on erythrocytes, is essential for the correct assembly of human basement membranes in kidney and skin.","Tetraspanins are thought to facilitate the formation of multiprotein complexes at cell surfaces, but evidence illuminating the biologic importance of this role is sparse. Tetraspanin CD151 forms very stable laminin-binding complexes with integrins alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1 in kidney and alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 in skin. It is encoded by a gene at the same position on chromosome 11p15.5 as the MER2 blood group gene. We show that CD151 expresses the MER2 blood group antigen and is located on erythrocytes. We examined CD151 in 3 MER2-negative patients (2 are sibs) of Indian Jewish origin with end-stage kidney disease. In addition to hereditary nephritis the sibs have sensorineural deafness, pretibial epidermolysis bullosa, and beta-thalassemia minor. The 3 patients are homozygous for a single nucleotide insertion (G383) in exon 5 of CD151, causing a frameshift and premature stop signal at codon 140. The resultant truncated protein would lack its integrin-binding domain. We conclude that CD151 is essential for the proper assembly of the glomerular and tubular basement membrane in kidney, has functional significance in the skin, is probably a component of the inner ear, and could play a role in erythropoiesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

By screening the hTR gene, we identified mutations in two of 17 patients with idiopathic aplastic anaemia, three of 27 patients with constitutional aplastic anaemia, but in none of 214 normal controls (p<0.0001). Furthermore, patients with hTR mutations had significantly shorter telomeres than age-matched controls (p=0.027). These data indicate that, in a subset of patients with aplastic anaemia, the disorder might be associated with a genetic lesion in the telomere maintenance pathway.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
10762540,Neurological phenotype in Waardenburg syndrome type 4 correlates with novel SOX10 truncating mutations and expression in developing brain.,"Waardenburg syndrome type 4 (WS4), also called Shah-Waardenburg syndrome, is a rare neurocristopathy that results from the absence of melanocytes and intrinsic ganglion cells of the terminal hindgut. WS4 is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait attributable to EDN3 or EDNRB mutations. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition when SOX10 mutations are involved. We report on three unrelated WS4 patients with growth retardation and an as-yet-unreported neurological phenotype with impairment of both the central and autonomous nervous systems and occasionally neonatal hypotonia and arthrogryposis. Each of the three patients was heterozygous for a SOX10 truncating mutation (Y313X in two patients and S251X [corrected] in one patient). The extended spectrum of the WS4 phenotype is relevant to the brain expression of SOX10 during human embryonic and fetal development. Indeed, the expression of SOX10 in human embryo was not restricted to neural-crest-derived cells but also involved fetal brain cells, most likely of glial origin. These data emphasize the important role of SOX10 in early development of both neural-crest-derived tissues, namely melanocytes, autonomic and enteric nervous systems, and glial cells of the central nervous system.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
16252232,Mutations in TCF8 cause posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy and ectopic expression of COL4A3 by corneal endothelial cells.,"Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD, also known as PPMD) is a rare disease involving metaplasia and overgrowth of corneal endothelial cells. In patients with PPCD, these cells manifest in an epithelial morphology and gene expression pattern, produce an aberrant basement membrane, and, sometimes, spread over the iris and nearby structures in a way that increases the risk for glaucoma. We previously mapped PPCD to a region (PPCD3) on chromosome 10 containing the gene that encodes the two-handed zinc-finger homeodomain transcription factor TCF8. Here, we report a heterozygous frameshift mutation in TCF8 that segregates with PPCD in the family used to map PPCD3 and four different heterozygous nonsense and frameshift mutations in TCF8 in four other PPCD probands. Family reports of inguinal hernia, hydrocele, and possible bone anomalies in affected individuals suggest that individuals with TCF8 mutations should be examined for nonocular anomalies. We detect transcripts of all three identified PPCD genes (VSX1, COL8A2, and TCF8) in the cornea. We show presence of a complex (core plus secondary) binding site for TCF8 in the promoter of Alport syndrome gene COL4A3, which encodes collagen type IV alpha 3, and we present immunohistochemical evidence of ectopic expression of COL4A3 in corneal endothelium of the proband of the original PPCD3 family. Identification of TCF8 as the PPCD3 gene provides a valuable tool for the study of critical gene regulation events in PPCD pathology and suggests a possible role for TCF8 mutations in altered structure and function of cells lining body cavities other than the anterior chamber of the eye. Thus, this study has identified TCF8 as the gene responsible for approximately half of the cases of PPCD, has implicated TCF8 mutations in developmental abnormalities outside the eye, and has presented the TCF8 regulatory target, COL4A3, as a key, shared molecular component of two different diseases, PPCD and Alport syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

Ouabain- and bumetanide-resistant Na+ and K+ effluxes in three pseudohyperkalaemic patients were not different from those of control subjects when assessed at 37 degrees C. 3. When the temperature was decreased to 20 degrees C and 9 degrees C, K+ passive permeability markedly increased and Na+ permeability remained unchanged in these patients. In contrast, in control subjects a reduction in temperature caused a marked reduction in Na+ and K+ passive permeability. 4. These findings could account for the marked increase in plasma K+ concentration observed at subphysiological temperatures. 5. The Na+-K+ co-transport pathway was reduced in all members of the family, but the Na+-K+ pump was reduced in only two of them. These alterations were independent from the pseudohyperkalaemic state.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
16928994,Aneurysm syndromes caused by mutations in the TGF-beta receptor.,"BACKGROUND: The Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a recently described autosomal dominant aortic-aneurysm syndrome with widespread systemic involvement. The disease is characterized by the triad of arterial tortuosity and aneurysms, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula or cleft palate and is caused by heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding transforming growth factor beta receptors 1 and 2 (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, respectively). METHODS: We undertook the clinical and molecular characterization of 52 affected families. Forty probands presented with typical manifestations of the Loeys-Dietz syndrome. In view of the phenotypic overlap between this syndrome and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, we screened an additional cohort of 40 patients who had vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome without the characteristic type III collagen abnormalities or the craniofacial features of the Loeys-Dietz syndrome. RESULTS: We found a mutation in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 in all probands with typical Loeys-Dietz syndrome (type I) and in 12 probands presenting with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Loeys-Dietz syndrome type II). The natural history of both types was characterized by aggressive arterial aneurysms (mean age at death, 26.0 years) and a high incidence of pregnancy-related complications (in 6 of 12 women). Patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type I, as compared with those with type II, underwent cardiovascular surgery earlier (mean age, 16.9 years vs. 26.9 years) and died earlier (22.6 years vs. 31.8 years). There were 59 vascular surgeries in the cohort, with one death during the procedure. This low rate of intraoperative mortality distinguishes the Loeys-Dietz syndrome from vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in either TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 predispose patients to aggressive and widespread vascular disease. The severity of the clinical presentation is predictive of the outcome. Genotyping of patients presenting with symptoms like those of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may be used to guide therapy, including the use and timing of prophylactic vascular surgery.",research-article; journal article

An 8-fold risk of EoE in patients with CTDs (relative risk, 8.1; 95% confidence limit, 5.1-12.9; Ï‡(2)1 = 112.0; P < 10(-3)) was present compared with the general population. Esophageal transcript profiling identified a distinct subset of genes, including COL8A2, in patients with EoE and CTDs.There is a remarkable association of EoE with CTDs and evidence for a differential expression of genes involved in connective tissue repair in this cohort. Thus, we propose stratification of patients with EoE and CTDs into a subset referred to as EoE-CTD.","research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

It is well known that HMSN VI is an axonal CMT neuropathy with optic atrophy. However, the differences between CMT2A and HMSN VI with MFN2 mutations remained to be clarified. Therefore, we studied the phenotypic characteristics of CMT patients with MFN2 mutations. Mutations in MFN2 were screened in 62 unrelated axonal CMT neuropathy families. We calculated CMT neuropathy scores (CMTNSs) and functional disability scales (FDSs) to quantify disease severity. Twenty-one patients with the MFN2 mutations were studied by brain MRI. Ten pathogenic mutations were identified in 26 patients from 15 families (24.2%). Six of these mutations had not been reported, and de novo mutations were observed in five families (33.3%). The electrophysiological patterns of affected individuals with the MFN2 mutations were typical of axonal CMT; however, the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics were markedly different in early (<10 years) and late disease-onset (> or =10 years) groups. All patients with an early onset had severe CMTNS (> or =21) and FDS (6 or 7), whereas most patients with late onset had mild CMTNS (< or =10) and FDS (< or =3). We identified two HMSN VI families with the R364W mutation in the early onset group; however, two other families with the same mutation did not have optic atrophy. In addition, two early onset families with R94W mutations, previously reported for HMSN VI, did not have visual impairment. Interestingly, eight patients had periventricular and subcortical hyperintense lesions by brain MRI. In the late-onset group, three patients had sensorineural hearing loss and two had bilateral extensor plantar responses. We found that MFN2 mutations are the major cause of axonal CMT neuropathy, and that they are associated with variable CNS involvements. Phenotypes were significantly different in the early and late disease-onset groups. Our findings suggest that HMSN VI might be a variant of the early onset severe CMT2A phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
10617473,Heterozygous germ line hCHK2 mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome.,"The hCHK2 gene encodes the human homolog of the yeast Cds1 and Rad53 G2 checkpoint kinases, whose activation in response to DNA damage prevents cellular entry into mitosis. Here, it is shown that heterozygous germ line mutations in hCHK2 occur in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a highly penetrant familial cancer phenotype usually associated with inherited mutations in the TP53 gene. These observations suggest that hCHK2 is a tumor suppressor gene conferring predisposition to sarcoma, breast cancer, and brain tumors, and they also provide a link between the central role of p53 inactivation in human cancer and the well-defined G2 checkpoint in yeast.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

The cell cycle checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2 act upstream of p53 in DNA damage responses, and recently rare germ-line mutations in CHK2 were reported in LFS families. We have analyzed CHK1, CHK2, and p53 genes for mutations in 44 Finnish families with LFS, Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome, or families phenotypically suggestive of LFS with conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis. Five different disease-causing mutations were observed in 7 families (7 of 44 families; 15.9%): 4 in the p53 gene (5 of 44 families; 11.4%) and 1 in the CHK2 gene (2 of 44 families; 4.5%). Interestingly, the other CHK2-mutation carrier also has a mutation in the MSH6 gene. The cancer phenotype in the CHK2-families was not characteristic of LFS, and may indicate variable phenotypic expression in the rare families with CHK2 mutations. No mutations in the CHK1 gene were identified. Additional work is necessary to completely unravel the molecular background of LFS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
12489043,A mutation in the fibroblast growth factor 14 gene is associated with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia [corrected].,"Hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders for which >/=14 different genetic loci have been identified. In some SCA types, expanded tri- or pentanucleotide repeats have been identified, and the length of these expansions correlates with the age at onset and with the severity of the clinical phenotype. In several other SCA types, no genetic defect has yet been identified. We describe a large, three-generation family with early-onset tremor, dyskinesia, and slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, not associated with any of the known SCA loci, and a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene on chromosome 13q34. Our observations are in accordance with the occurrence of ataxia and paroxysmal dyskinesia in Fgf14-knockout mice. As indicated by protein modeling, the amino acid change from phenylalanine to serine at position 145 is predicted to reduce the stability of the protein. The present FGF14 mutation represents a novel gene defect involved in the neurodegeneration of cerebellum and basal ganglia.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case-report"
16211615,Spinocerebellar ataxia associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor 14 gene (SCA27): A new phenotype.,"Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are genetically classified into spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). We describe 14 patients of a Dutch pedigree displaying a distinct SCA-phenotype (SCA27) associated with a F145S mutation in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene on chromosome 13q34. The patients showed a childhood-onset postural tremor and a slowly progressive ataxia evolving from young adulthood. Dyskinesia was often present, suggesting basal ganglia involvement, which was supported by functional imaging in 1 patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed only moderate cerebellar atrophy in the 2 eldest patients. Neuropsychological testing indicated low IQ and deficits in memory and executive functioning. Behavioral problems were also observed. Further investigations will have to determine the role of FGF14 in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and the frequency of this FGF14 mutation in SCA.

The translocation breakpoint is identical in both patients, disrupting the gene-encoding fibroblast growth factor 14 isoform b (FGF14-1b). Clinically, both show signs of SCA, although the daughter is the most affected with early onset cerebellar ataxia, microcephaly, and severe mental retardation. FGF14-1b is the predominant isoform in brain, where it interacts with the voltage gated Na channel. Fgf14(-/-) mice develop ataxia and paroxysmal dyskinesia and have cognitive deficits. One missense and one non-sense mutation in FGF14 have previously been linked to SCA27. Truncation of one allele in our patients suggests that haploinsuffiency of FGF14 can cause SCA27.",journal article; case reports
8145827,Mutation in the DNA mismatch repair gene homologue hMLH1 is associated with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer.,"The human DNA mismatch repair gene homologue hMSH2, on chromosome 2p is involved in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). On the basis of linkage data, a second HNPCC locus was assigned to chromosome 3p21-23 (ref. 3). Here we report that a human gene encoding a protein, hMLH1 (human MutL homologue), homologous to the bacterial DNA mismatch repair protein MutL, is located on human chromosome 3p21.3-23. We propose that hMLH1 is the HNPCC gene located on 3p because of the similarity of the hMLH1 gene product to the yeast DNA mismatch repair protein, MLH1, the coincident location of the hMLH1 gene and the HNPCC locus on chromosome 3, and hMLH1 missense mutations in affected individuals from a chromosome 3-linked HNPCC family.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15523498,Mutations in the known genes are not the major cause of MED; distinctive phenotypic entities among patients with no identified mutations.,"Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous chondrodysplasia. Mutations in six genes (COMP, COL9A1, COL9A2, COL9A3, MATN3 and DTDST) have been reported, but the genotype-phenotype correlations and the proportions of cases due to mutations in these genes are still not well characterized. We performed a clinical, radiological and molecular analysis of known MED genes on 29 consecutive MED patients. The mutation analysis resulted in identification of the DTDST mutation in four patients (14%), the COMP mutation in three (10%) and the MATN3 mutation in three (10%). Thus, a disease-causing mutation was identified in 10 patients altogether (34%). The phenotypic features observed in the patients with mutations were in accordance with previously described phenotypes, but two new distinct phenotypic entities were identified in patients in whom no mutation was found. One of them was characterized by severe, early-onset dysplasia of the proximal femurs with almost complete absence of the secondary ossification centres and abnormal development of the femoral necks. The other phenotype was characterized by 'mini-epiphyses', resulting in severe dysplasia of the proximal femoral heads. The findings suggest that mutations in the known genes are not the major cause of MED and are responsible for less than half of the cases. The existence of additional MED loci is supported by the exclusion of known loci by mutation analysis and finding of specific subgroups among these patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

15918153,3q29 microdeletion syndrome: clinical and molecular characterization of a new syndrome.,"We report the identification of six patients with 3q29 microdeletion syndrome. The clinical phenotype is variable despite an almost identical deletion size. The phenotype includes mild-to-moderate mental retardation, with only slightly dysmorphic facial features that are similar in most patients: a long and narrow face, short philtrum, and high nasal bridge. Autism, gait ataxia, chest-wall deformity, and long and tapering fingers were noted in at least two of six patients. Additional features--including microcephaly, cleft lip and palate, horseshoe kidney and hypospadias, ligamentous laxity, recurrent middle ear infections, and abnormal pigmentation--were observed, but each feature was only found once, in a single patient. The microdeletion is approximately 1.5 Mb in length, with molecular boundaries mapping within the same or adjacent bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones at either end of the deletion in all patients. The deletion encompasses 22 genes, including PAK2 and DLG1, which are autosomal homologues of two known X-linked mental retardation genes, PAK3 and DLG3. The presence of two nearly identical low-copy repeat sequences in BAC clones on each side of the deletion breakpoint suggests that nonallelic homologous recombination is the likely mechanism of disease causation in this syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case-report"

We found a novel USH1 locus designated USH1H that mapped to chromosome 15q22-23 in a 4.92-cM interval. This locus overlaps the non-syndromic deafness locus DFNB48 raising the possibility that the two disorders may be caused by allelic mutations.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
17721977,Missense and nonsense mutations in the alternatively-spliced exon 2 of COL2A1 cause the ocular variant of Stickler syndrome.,"Stickler syndrome type I (STL1) is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder characterized by ocular and extraocular features. It is caused by null-allele mutations in the COL2A1 gene that codes for procollagen II. COL2A1 precursor mRNA undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms, a long form including exon 2 (type IIA isoform) and a short form excluding exon 2 (type IIB isoform). The short form is predominantly expressed by differentiated chondrocytes in adult cartilage, and the long form in chondroprogenitor cells during early development and in the vitreous of the eye, which is the only adult tissue containing procollagen IIA. Recent evidence indicates that due to the tissue-specific expression of these two isoforms, premature termination codon mutations in exon 2 cause Stickler syndrome with minimal or no extraocular manifestations. We describe here two mutations in exon 2 of COL2A1 in three patients with predominantly ocular Stickler syndrome: Cys64Stop in two patients, and a novel structural mutation, Cys57Tyr, in one patient. RT-PCR of total lymphoblast RNA from one patient with the Cys64Stop mutation revealed that only the normal allele of the IIA form was present, indicating that the mutation resulted either in complete loss of the allele by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or by skipping of exon 2 via nonsense-mediated altered splicing, resulting in production of the type IIB isoform. The results of COL2A1 minigene expression studies suggest that both Cys64Stop and Cys57Tyr alter positive cis regulatory elements for splicing, resulting in a lower IIA:IIB ratio.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
15671297,A novel mutation of COL2A1 resulting in dominantly inherited rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.,"PURPOSE: To determine the molecular defect in a family with autosomal dominant rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (DRRD), and to investigate missplicing as a possible phenotypic modifier of mutations in COL2A1. METHODS: Clinical examination of the family and linkage analysis using markers flanking COL2A1 and COL11A1, the known loci for Stickler syndrome; mutation screening of COL2A1; construction of splicing reporter minigenes and transfection into cultured cells; and RT-PCR analysis of reporter specific transcripts. RESULTS: A family with DRRD showed no systemic clinical signs (skeletal, orofacial, or auditory) usually associated with Stickler syndrome. Linkage analysis excluded COL11A1 as the disease locus but could not exclude COL2A1. Mutation screening of COL2A1 identified a novel G118R mutation in type II collagen. Transfection of minigenes carrying mutations associated with DRRD (G118R, R453X, and L467F) into cultured cells detected no missplicing of mRNA from mutant constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations outside the alternatively spliced exon 2 region of COL2A1 can also result in an ocular only phenotype. There was no evidence that missplicing modifies the phenotype of these mutations, suggesting that the minimal or absent systemic features demonstrated by the G118R and L467F mutations are the result of the biophysical changes imparted on the collagen molecule.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
7730648,Inherited human complement C5 deficiency. Nonsense mutations in exons 1 (Gln1 to Stop) and 36 (Arg1458 to Stop) and compound heterozygosity in three African-American families.,"Hereditary C5 deficiency has been reported in several families of different ethnic backgrounds and from different geographic regions, but the molecular genetic defect causing C5 deficiency has not been delineated in any of them. To examine the molecular basis of C5 deficiency in the African-American population, the exons and intron/exon boundaries of the C5 structural genes from three C5-deficient (C5D) African-American families were sequenced, revealing two nonsense mutations. The nonsense mutations are located in exon 1 (C84AG to TAG) in two of the C5D families (Rhode Island and North Carolina) and in exon 36 (C4521GA to TGA) in the third C5D family (New York). The exon 1 and 36 mutations are contained in codons that encode the first amino acid of the C5 beta-chain (Gln1 to Stop) and residue 1458 in the alpha-chain (Arg1458 to Stop), respectively. Allele-specific PCR and sequence analyses demonstrated that the exon 1 mutation is present in only one of the C5 null genes in both the Rhode Island and North Carolina families, and the exon 36 mutation is contained in only one C5 null gene in the New York family. Neither of the nonsense mutations was found in the European or Caucasian-American C5D individuals examined. Collectively, these data indicate that: 1) C5 deficiency is caused by several different molecular genetic defects, 2) C5 deficiency in the African-American population can be explained in part by two distinct nonsense mutations in exons 1 and 36, and 3) compound heterozygosity exists in all of the reported African-American C5D families.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
14676148,Sudden death associated with short-QT syndrome linked to mutations in HERG.,"Sudden cardiac death takes the lives of more than 300 000 Americans annually. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias occurring in individuals with structurally normal hearts account for a subgroup of these sudden deaths. The present study describes the genetic basis for a new clinical entity characterized by sudden death and short-QT intervals in the ECG.Three families with hereditary short-QT syndrome and a high incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death were studied. In 2 of them, we identified 2 different missense mutations resulting in the same amino acid change (N588K) in the S5-P loop region of the cardiac IKr channel HERG (KCNH2). The mutations dramatically increase IKr, leading to heterogeneous abbreviation of action potential duration and refractoriness, and reduce the affinity of the channels to IKr blockers.We demonstrate a novel genetic and biophysical mechanism responsible for sudden death in infants, children, and young adults caused by mutations in KCNH2. The occurrence of sudden cardiac death in the first 12 months of life in 2 patients suggests the possibility of a link between KCNH2 gain of function mutations and sudden infant death syndrome. KCNH2 is the binding target for a wide spectrum of cardiac and noncardiac pharmacological compounds. Our findings may provide better understanding of drug interaction with KCNH2 and have implications for diagnosis and therapy of this and other arrhythmogenic diseases.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
12925462,Short QT Syndrome: a familial cause of sudden death.,"BACKGROUND: A prolonged QT interval is associated with a risk for life-threatening events. However, little is known about prognostic implications of the reverse-a short QT interval. Several members of 2 different families were referred for syncope, palpitations, and resuscitated cardiac arrest in the presence of a positive family history for sudden cardiac death. Autopsy did not reveal any structural heart disease. All patients had a constantly and uniformly short QT interval at ECG. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six patients from both families were submitted to extensive noninvasive and invasive work-up, including serial resting ECGs, echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, exercise testing, Holter ECG, and signal-averaged ECG. Four of 6 patients underwent electrophysiological evaluation including programmed ventricular stimulation. In all subjects, a structural heart disease was excluded. At baseline ECG, all patients exhibited a QT interval <or=280 ms (QTc <or=300 ms). During electrophysiological study, short atrial and ventricular refractory periods were documented in all and increased ventricular vulnerability to fibrillation in 3 of 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The short QT syndrome is characterized by familial sudden death, short refractory periods, and inducible ventricular fibrillation. It is important to recognize this ECG pattern because it is related to a high risk of sudden death in young, otherwise healthy subjects.",clinical trial; journal article
15890322,Short QT syndrome.,"The short QT syndrome constitutes a new clinical entity that is associated with a high incidence of sudden cardiac death, syncope, and/or atrial fibrillation even in young patients and newborns. Patients with this congenital electrical abnormality are characterized by rate-corrected QT intervals<320 ms. Missense mutations in KCNH2 (HERG) linked to a gain-of-function of the rapidly activating delayed-rectifier current I(Kr) have been identified in the first two reported families with familial sudden cardiac death. Recently, two further gain-of-function mutations in the KCNQ1 gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the KvLQT1 (I(Ks)) channel and in the KCNJ2 gene encoding the strong inwardly rectifying channel protein Kir2.1 confirmed a genetically heterogeneous disease. The possible substrate for the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias may be a significant transmural dispersion of the repolarisation due to a heterogeneous abbreviation of the action potential duration. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator is the therapy of choice in patients with syncope and a positive family history of sudden cardiac death. However, ICD therapy in patients with a short QT syndrome has an increased risk for inappropriate shock therapies due to possible T wave oversensing. The impact of sotalol, ibutilide, flecainide, and quinidine on QT prolongation has been evaluated, but only quinidine effectively suppressed gain-of-function in I(Kr) with prolongation of the QT interval. In patients with a mutation in HERG, it rendered ventricular tachycardias/ventricular fibrillation non-inducible and restored the QT interval/heart rate relationship towards a normal range. It may serve as an adjunct to ICD therapy or as a possible alternative treatment, especially for children and newborns.",review; journal article
15761194,A novel form of short QT syndrome (SQT3) is caused by a mutation in the KCNJ2 gene.,"Short QT syndrome (SQTS) leads to an abbreviated QTc interval and predisposes patients to life-threatening arrhythmias. To date, two forms of the disease have been identified: SQT1, caused by a gain of function substitution in the HERG (I(Kr)) channel, and SQT2, caused by a gain of function substitution in the KvLQT1 (I(Ks)) channel. Here we identify a new variant, ""SQT3"", which has a unique ECG phenotype characterized by asymmetrical T waves, and a defect in the gene coding for the inwardly rectifying Kir2.1 (I(K1)) channel. The affected members of a single family had a G514A substitution in the KCNJ2 gene that resulted in a change from aspartic acid to asparagine at position 172 (D172N). Whole-cell patch-clamp studies of the heterologously expressed human D172N channel demonstrated a larger outward I(K1) than the wild-type (P<0.05) at potentials between -75 mV and -45 mV, with the peak current being shifted in the former with respect to the latter (WT, -75 mV; D172N, -65 mV). Coexpression of WT and mutant channels to mimic the heterozygous condition of the proband yielded an outward current that was intermediate between WT and D172N. In computer simulations using a human ventricular myocyte model the increased outward I(K1) greatly accelerated the final phase of repolarization, and shortened the action potential duration. Hence, unlike the known mutations in the two other SQTS forms (N588K in HERG and V307L in KvLQT1), simulations using the D172N and WT/D172N mutations fully accounted for the ECG phenotype of tall and asymmetrically shaped T waves. Although we were unable to test for inducibility of arrhythmia susceptibility due to lack of patients' consent, our computer simulations predict a steeper steady-state restitution curve for the D172N and WT/D172N mutation, compared with WT or to HERG or KvLQT1 mutations, which may predispose SQT3 patients to a greater risk of reentrant arrhythmias.",review-article; review; journal article
15994876,Homozygous mutations in LPIN2 are responsible for the syndrome of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (Majeed syndrome).,"BACKGROUND: Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive, autoinflammatory disorder characterised by chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia. The objectives of this study were to map, identify, and characterise the Majeed syndrome causal gene and to speculate on its function and role in skin and bone inflammation. METHODS: Six individuals with Majeed syndrome from two unrelated families were identified for this study. Homozygosity mapping and parametric linkage analysis were employed for the localisation of the gene responsible for Majeed syndrome. Direct sequencing was utilised for the identification of mutations within the genes contained in the region of linkage. Expression studies and in silico characterisation of the identified causal gene and its protein were carried out. RESULTS: The phenotype of Majeed syndrome includes inflammation of the bone and skin, recurrent fevers, and dyserythropoietic anaemia. The clinical picture of the six affected individuals is briefly reviewed. The gene was mapped to a 5.5 cM interval (1.8 Mb) on chromosome 18p. Examination of genes in this interval led to the identification of homozygous mutations in LPIN2 in affected individuals from the two families. LPIN2 was found to be expressed in almost all tissues. The function of LPIN2 and its role in inflammation remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that homozygous mutations in LPIN2 result in Majeed syndrome. Understanding the aberrant immune response in this condition will shed light on the aetiology of other inflammatory disorders of multifactorial aetiology including isolated chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, Sweet syndrome, and psoriasis.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

20966167,The platelet P2Y₁₂ receptor for adenosine diphosphate: congenital and drug-induced defects.,"P2Y₁₂, the G(i)-coupled platelet receptor for adenosine diphosphate (ADP), plays a central role in platelet function. Patients with congenital P2Y₁₂ defects display a mild to moderate bleeding diathesis, characterized by mucocutaneous bleedings and excessive post-surgical and post-traumatic blood loss. Defects of P2Y₁₂ should be suspected when ADP, even at high concentrations (≥ 10 μM), is unable to induce full, irreversible platelet aggregation. Tests that evaluate the degree of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by ADP should be used to confirm the diagnosis. Drugs that inhibit P2Y₁₂ are potent antithrombotic drugs, attesting the central role played by P2Y₁₂ in platelet thrombus formation. Clopidogrel, the most widely used drug that inhibits P2Y₁₂, is effective both in monotherapy and in combination with acetylsalicylic acid. The most important drawback of clopidogrel is its inability to inhibit adequately P2Y₁₂-dependent platelet function in approximately one-third of patients who are therefore not protected from major cardiovascular events. New drugs, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, which effectively inhibit P2Y₁₂ in the majority of patients, proved to be more efficacious than clopdidogrel in preventing major cardiovascular events. Although they increase the incidence of major bleedings, the net clinical benefit is in favor of the new P2Y₁₂ inhibitors.",review; journal article
10816552,A natural dominant negative P2X1 receptor due to deletion of a single amino acid residue.,"The P2X1 receptor belongs to a family of oligomeric ATP-gated ion channels with intracellular N and C termini and two transmembrane segments separating a large extracellular domain. Here, we describe a naturally occurring dominant negative P2X1 mutant. This mutant lacks one leucine within a stretch of four leucine residues in its second transmembrane domain (TM2) (amino acids 351-354). Confocal microscopy revealed proper plasma membrane localization of the mutant in stably transfected HEK293 cells. Nevertheless, voltage-clamped HEK293 cells expressing mutated P2X1 channels failed to develop an ATP or ADP-induced current. Furthermore, when co-expressed with the wild type receptor in Xenopus oocytes, the mutated protein exhibited a dose-dependent dominant negative effect on the normal ATP or ADP-induced P2X1 channel activity. These data indicate that deletion of a single apolar amino acid residue at the inner border of the P2X1 TM2 generates a nonfunctional channel. The inactive and dominant negative form of the P2X1 receptor may constitute a new tool for the study of the physiological role of this channel in native cells.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

9013451,Dominantly transmitted glomerulocystic kidney disease: a distinct genetic entity.,"Glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD) is a relatively rare condition with both a sporadic and familial occurrence. Pathologically, GCKD is characterized by cystic dilatation of Bowman's space and the initial proximal convoluted tubule. As a heritable disorder, GCKD has primarily been recognized in infants with a family history of classic, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Dominantly transmitted GCKD associated with either hypoplastic or normal-sized kidneys has also been reported in older children and adults. A large, three-generation African-American family with familial GCKD is characterized. Of the 20 individuals available for study, seven affected individuals were identified by renal sonogram or renal histopathology. GCKD in this family segregates as an autosomal dominant trait as evidenced by its apparent transmission from a father to his sons. A set of directed linkage strategies indicates that the distinctive GCKD phenotype in this family results from a dominantly acting mutation that disrupts a genetic locus distinct from the ADPKD loci, PKD1 and PKD2, as well the human homologue of mouse jcpk mutation, a newly described murine GCKD. These analyses are the first known genetic studies conducted in a family with heritable GCKD and post-infantile age of onset.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
12610310,Dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure caused by a mutation in phospholamban.,"Molecular etiologies of heart failure, an emerging cardiovascular epidemic affecting 4.7 million Americans and costing 17.8 billion health-care dollars annually, remain poorly understood. Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg --> Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN), a transmembrane phosphoprotein that inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) pump. Transgenic PLN(R9C) mice recapitulated human heart failure with premature death. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. Rather, PLN(R9C) trapped protein kinase A (PKA), which blocked PKA-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type PLN and in turn delayed decay of calcium transients in myocytes. These results indicate that myocellular calcium dysregulation can initiate human heart failure-a finding that may lead to therapeutic opportunities.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17924349,Mutations in TOPORS cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa with perivascular retinal pigment epithelium atrophy.,"We report mutations in the gene for topoisomerase I-binding RS protein (TOPORS) in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) linked to chromosome 9p21.1 (locus RP31). A positional-cloning approach, together with the use of bioinformatics, identified TOPORS (comprising three exons and encoding a protein of 1,045 aa) as the gene responsible for adRP. Mutations that include an insertion and a deletion have been identified in two adRP-affected families--one French Canadian and one German family, respectively. Interestingly, a distinct phenotype is noted at the earlier stages of the disease, with an unusual perivascular cuff of retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, which was found surrounding the superior and inferior arcades in the retina. TOPORS is a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and localizes in the nucleus in speckled loci that are associated with promyelocytic leukemia bodies. The ubiquitous nature of TOPORS expression and a lack of mutant protein in patients are highly suggestive of haploinsufficiency, rather than a dominant negative effect, as the molecular mechanism of the disease and make rescue of the clinical phenotype amenable to somatic gene therapy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
16642431,Fine-mapping chromosome 20 in 230 systemic lupus erythematosus sib pair and multiplex families: evidence for genetic epistasis with chromosome 16q12.,"The presence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility genes on chromosome 20 is suggested by the observation of genetic linkage in several independent SLE family collections. To further localize the genetic effects, we typed 59 microsatellites in the two best regions, as defined by genome screens. Genotypes were analyzed for statistical linkage and/or association with SLE, by use of a combination of nonparametric linkage methods, family-based tests of association (transmission/disequilibrium and pedigree disequilibrium tests), and haplotype-sharing statistics (haplotype runs test), in a set of 230 SLE pedigrees. Maximal evidence for linkage to SLE was to 20p12 (LOD = 2.84) and 20q13.1 (LOD = 1.64) in the white pedigrees. Subsetting families on the basis of evidence for linkage to 16q12 significantly improved the LOD scores at both chromosome 20 locations (20p12 LOD = 5.06 and 20q13 LOD = 3.65), consistent with epistasis. We then typed 162 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers across a 1.3-Mb candidate region on 20q13.1 and identified several SNPs that demonstrated significant evidence for association. These data provide additional support for linkage and association to 20p12 and 20q13.1 in SLE and further refine the intervals of interest. These data further suggest the possibility of epistatic relationships among loci within the 20q12, 20q13, and 16q12 regions in SLE families.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
9843983,A genome-wide search for susceptibility genes in human systemic lupus erythematosus sib-pair families.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. Previous genetic studies have suggested associations with HLA Class II alleles, complement gene deficiencies, and Fc receptor polymorphisms; however, it is likely that other genes contribute to SLE susceptibility and pathogenesis. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide microsatellite marker screen in 105 SLE sib-pair families. By using multipoint nonparametric methods, the strongest evidence for linkage was found near the HLA locus (6p11-p21) [D6S257, logarithm of odds (lod) = 3.90, P = 0.000011] and at three additional regions: 16q13 (D16S415, lod = 3.64, P = 0.000022), 14q21-23 (D14S276, lod = 2.81, P = 0.00016), and 20p12 (D20S186, lod = 2.62, P = 0.00025). Another nine regions (1p36, 1p13, 1q42, 2p15, 2q21-33, 3cent-q11, 4q28, 11p15, and 15q26) were identified with lod scores >/=1.00. These data support the hypothesis that multiple genes, including one in the HLA region, influence susceptibility to human SLE.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
16261342,A novel autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment locus (DFNB47) maps to chromosome 2p25.1-p24.3.,"Hereditary hearing impairment (HI) displays extensive genetic heterogeneity. Autosomal recessive (AR) forms of prelingual HI account for approximately 75% of cases with a genetic etiology. A novel AR non-syndromic HI locus (DFNB47) was mapped to chromosome 2p25.1-p24.3, in two distantly related Pakistani kindreds. Genome scan and fine mapping were carried out using microsatellite markers. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum LOD score of 4.7 at markers D2S1400 and D2S262. The three-unit support interval was bounded by D2S330 and D2S131. The region of homozygosity was found within the three-unit support interval and flanked by markers D2S2952 and D2S131, which corresponds to 13.2 cM according to the Rutgers combined linkage-physical map. This region contains 5.3 Mb according to the sequence-based physical map. Three candidate genes, KCNF1, ID2 and ATP6V1C2 were sequenced, and were found to be negative for functional sequence variants.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

To date, at least 50 loci for autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (ADNSSHL) have been identified by linkage analysis.To report the mapping of a novel autosomal dominant deafness locus on the long arm of chromosome 14 at 14q11.2-q12, DFNA53, in a large multigenerational Chinese family with post-lingual, high frequency hearing loss that progresses to involve all frequencies.A maximum multipoint LOD score of 5.4 was obtained for marker D14S1280. The analysis of recombinant haplotypes mapped DFNA53 to a 9.6 cM region interval between markers D14S581 and D14S1021. Four deafness loci (DFNA9, DFNA23, DFNB5, and DFNB35) have previously been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 14. The critical region for DFNA53 contains the gene for DFNA9 but does not overlap with the regions for DFNB5, DFNA23, or DFNB35. Screening of the COCH gene (DFNA9), BOCT, EFS, and HSPC156 within the DFNA53 interval did not identify the cause for deafness in this family.Identifying the DFNA53 locus is the first step in isolating the gene responsible for hearing loss in this large multigeneration Chinese family.","letter; research support, n.i.h., extramural; case-report"
16532400,GDF5 is a second locus for multiple-synostosis syndrome.,"Multiple-synostosis syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive symphalangism, carpal/tarsal fusions, deafness, and mild facial dysmorphism. Heterozygosity for functional null mutations in the NOGGIN gene has been shown to be responsible for the disorder. However, in a cohort of six probands with multiple-synostosis syndrome, only one was found to be heterozygous for a NOGGIN mutation (W205X). Linkage studies involving the four-generation family of one of the mutation-negative patients excluded the NOGGIN locus, providing genetic evidence of locus heterogeneity. In this family, polymorphic markers flanking the GDF5 locus were found to cosegregate with the disease, and sequence analysis demonstrated that affected individuals in the family were heterozygous for a novel missense mutation that predicts an R438L substitution in the GDF5 protein. Unlike mutations that lead to haploinsufficiency for GDF5 and produce brachydactyly C, the protein encoded by the multiple-synostosis-syndrome allele was secreted as a mature GDF5 dimer. These data establish locus heterogeneity in multiple-synostosis syndrome and demonstrate that the disorder can result from mutations in either the NOGGIN or the GDF5 gene.",research-article; journal article
15671264,Congenital stromal dystrophy of the cornea caused by a mutation in the decorin gene.,"PURPOSE: To describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of a family with a congenital stromal dystrophy of the cornea and to identify the genetic basis for this disorder. METHODS: All family members in three generations underwent ophthalmic examination. Stored corneal buttons were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Molecular genetic studies, including a genome-wide scan with microsatellite markers, linkage analysis, and DNA sequencing, were performed. RESULTS: The dystrophy was inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and was seen as clouded corneas shortly after birth. No associated systemic abnormalities or congenital diseases were present. After penetrating keratoplasty (PK), the grafts remained completely clear in 56% of the eyes with a mean (range) observation period of 19.5 years (3-36). Transmission electron microscopy of corneal buttons revealed lamellae with normal arrangement of collagen fibrils separated by abnormal fibrillar layers. Genome-wide screening revealed linkage to chromosome 12q22, with a maximum LOD score of 4.68 at D12S351. Subsequent sequencing of candidate genes revealed a frameshift mutation in the DCN gene (c.967delT) that encodes for decorin, predicting a C-terminal truncation of the decorin protein (p.S323fsX5). CONCLUSIONS: The authors hypothesize that truncated decorin binds to collagen in a suboptimal way, disturbing the regularity of corneal collagen fibril formation and thereby causing corneal opacities. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of a disorder associated with an inherited alteration in the decorin gene in humans.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16525031,Mapping of hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome (HMPS) to chromosome 10q23 by genomewide high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scan and identification of BMPR1A loss of function.,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome (HMPS) is characterised by colonic polyps of mixed histological types that are autosomal dominantly inherited and eventually lead to colorectal cancer (CRC). Study of the molecular basis of HMPS will enhance our knowledge of the genetic basis of the mixed polyposis-carcinoma sequence in both hereditary and sporadic CRC. METHODS/RESULTS: We performed a genomewide linkage search on 15 members of a three-generation HMPS family using the GeneChip Human Mapping 10K Array and identified a 7 cM putative linkage interval on chromosome 10q23. Subsequently, 32 members from two HMPS families were typed with nine microsatellite markers spanning the region and the linkage was confirmed with a maximum multi-point logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 4.6 (p<0.001). The 10q23.1-10q23.31 haplotypes segregate with the disease in both families. We screened for mutations in four candidate genes within the linkage region and identified an 11 bp deletion in the bone morphogenesis protein receptor 1A (BMPR1A) gene in one family. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that BMPR1A mutation accounts for HMPS. The data suggest that inactivating BMPR1A can initiate colorectal tumourigenesis via the mixed polyposis-carcinoma sequence.","letter; research support, non-u.s. gov't; case-report"
12200739,Clinical and laboratory findings in twins with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy mimicking aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency.,"Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) is a vitamin B 6 requiring enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine (DA) and serotonin. Lack of AADC leads to a combined deficiency of the catecholamines DA, norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E) as well as of serotonin. Here we describe premature twins who presented with severe seizures, myoclonus, rotatory eye movements and sudden clonic contractions. The patients showed an improvement of the clonic contractions under vitamin B 6 supplementation but died in the third week of life. In CSF and urine a biochemical pattern indicative of AADC deficiency was revealed. Concentrations of homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were decreased, in association with increased concentrations of 3-ortho-methyldopa (3-OMD) in CSF and significantly increased vanillactic acid in urine. The AADC enzyme substrates L-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) were elevated in CSF. Elevated concentrations of threonine as well as of an unidentified compound in CSF rounded off the biochemical pattern. AADC activity was found to be increased in plasma and deficient in the liver. Molecular studies effectively ruled out a genetic defect in the AADC gene. The basis for the epileptic encephalopathy in the twins may be located in the metabolism of vitamin B 6 and remains to be defined.",journal article; case reports
15257456,CHX10 mutations cause non-syndromic microphthalmia/ anophthalmia in Arab and Jewish kindreds.,"Microphthalmia/anophthalmia is a clinically heterogeneous disorder of eye formation, ranging from small size of a single eye to complete bilateral absence of ocular tissues. The genetic defect underlying isolated autosomal recessive microphthalmia/anophthalmia is yet unclear. We studied four families (two of Arab origin, one of Bedouin origin, and one of Persian-Jewish origin) with autosomal recessive microphthalmia/anophthalmia and no associated eye anomalies, and one Syrian-Jewish family with associated colobomas. Assuming a founder effect in each of the families, we performed homozygosity mapping using polymorphic markers adjacent to human homologues of genes known to be associated with eye absence in various species, namely EYA1, EYA2, EYA3, SIX4, SIX6, PAX6 and CHX10. No association was found with EYA1, EYA2, EYA3, SIX6 or PAX6. In two families, linkage analysis was consistent with possible association with SIX4, but no mutations were found in the coding region of the gene or its flanking intron sequences. In three of the five families, linkage analysis followed by sequencing demonstrated that affected individuals in each family were homozygous for a different CHX10 aberration: a mutation in the CVC domain and a deletion of the homeobox domain were found in two Arab families, and a mutation in the donor-acceptor site in the first intron in the Syrian-Jewish family. There was phenotypic variation between families having different mutations, but no significant phenotypic variation within each family. It has been previously shown that mutations in a particular nucleotide in CHX10 are associated with an autosomal recessive syndrome of microphthalmia/anophthalmia with iris colobomas and cataracts in two families. We now show that different mutations in other domains of the same gene underlie isolated microphthalmia/anophthalmia.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
10932181,Human microphthalmia associated with mutations in the retinal homeobox gene CHX10.,"Isolated human microphthalmia/anophthalmia, a cause of congenital blindness, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous developmental disorder characterized by a small eye and other ocular abnormalities. Three microphthalmia/anophthalmia loci have been identified, and two others have been inferred by the co-segregation of translocations with the phenotype. We previously found that mice with ocular retardation (the or-J allele), a microphthalmia phenotype, have a null mutation in the retinal homeobox gene Chx10 (refs 7,8). We report here the mapping of a human microphthalmia locus on chromosome 14q24.3, the cloning of CHX10 at this locus and the identification of recessive CHX10 mutations in two families with non-syndromic microphthalmia (MIM 251600), cataracts and severe abnormalities of the iris. In affected individuals, a highly conserved arginine residue in the DNA-recognition helix of the homeodomain is replaced by glutamine or proline (R200Q and R200P, respectively). Identification of the CHX10 consensus DNA-binding sequence (TAATTAGC) allowed us to demonstrate that both mutations severely disrupt CHX10 function. Human CHX10 is expressed in progenitor cells of the developing neuroretina and in the inner nuclear layer of the mature retina. The strong conservation in vertebrates of the CHX10 sequence, pattern of expression and loss-of-function phenotypes demonstrates the evolutionary importance of the genetic network through which this gene regulates eye development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

Recently we experienced an 11-yr-old girl with meningococcal meningitis who was diagnosed as having C7 deficiency based upon the undetectable serum C7 protein on radial immunodiffusion and the undetectable serum total and C7 hemolytic activities. To identify the genetic basis of the C7 deficiency of the patient, we performed a mutation analysis for the C7 gene and found two novel mutations; a point mutation at the 3' splice acceptor site of intron 4 (c.281-1G>T) and a large deletion mutation encompassing almost the whole C7 gene from exon 1 to exon 17 (c.1-?_2350+?del). A haplotype analysis showed that the large deletion mutation was inherited from the patient's father.

We have tentatively named this condition MORM syndrome. It shows similarities to Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Cohen syndrome, but can be distinguished by clinical features; the age of onset and nonprogressive nature of the visual impairment, the lack of characteristic facies, skin or gingival infection, microcephaly, 'mottled retina', polydactyly and small penis without testicular anomalies. Furthermore, linkage to the known Bardet-Biedl (BBS1-8) and Cohen syndrome loci was excluded. Autozygosity mapping identified a single homozygous subtelomeric region shared by all affecteds on chromosome 9q34.3, with a maximum LOD score of 5.64.

Database analysis of three German metropolitan regions identified 30 patients with LDS and TGFBR1 mutation in 6 and a TGFBR2 mutation in 24 individuals (17 men; mean age: 31 ± 19 years), as well as 60 age and sex-matched control patients with Marfan syndrome carrying a FBN1 mutation. DE was present in 22 patients with LDS (73%), and it related to skeletal score points (p = 0.008), non-skeletal score points (p < 0.001), and to the presence of ≥7 systemic score points (p = 0.010). Similarly, the severity of DE was related to body height (p = 0.010) and non-skeletal score points (p = 0.004). Frequency (p = 0.131) and severity of DE (p = 0.567) was similar in LDS and Marfan syndrome. DE is a manifestation of LDS that occurs with similar frequency and severity as in Marfan syndrome. Severity of DE may serve as a marker of the overall connective tissue disease severity. LDS may be considered in patients with DE.",journal article

AGS may result from a perturbation of interferon alpha metabolism. The disorder is genetically heterogeneous with approximately 50% of families mapping to the first known locus at 3p21 (AGS1).A genome-wide scan was performed in 10 families with a clinical diagnosis of AGS in whom linkage to AGS1 had been excluded.

The AGS2 locus lies within a 4.7 cM region as defined by a 1 LOD-unit support interval.We have identified a second AGS disease locus and at least one further locus. As in a number of other conditions, genetic heterogeneity represents a significant obstacle to gene identification in AGS.

17568391,Candidate genes for congenital diaphragmatic hernia from animal models: sequencing of FOG2 and PDGFRalpha reveals rare variants in diaphragmatic hernia patients.,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a common, life threatening birth defect. Although there is strong evidence implicating genetic factors in its pathogenesis, few causative genes have been identified, and in isolated CDH, only one de novo, nonsense mutation has been reported in FOG2 in a female with posterior diaphragmatic eventration. We report here that the homozygous null mouse for the Pdgfralpha gene has posterolateral diaphragmatic defects and thus is a model for human CDH. We hypothesized that mutations in this gene could cause human CDH. We sequenced PDGFRalpha and FOG2 in 96 patients with CDH, of which 53 had isolated CDH (55.2%), 36 had CDH and additional anomalies (37.5%), and 7 had CDH and known chromosome aberrations (7.3%). For FOG2, we identified novel sequence alterations predicting p.M703L and p.T843A in two patients with isolated CDH that were absent in 526 and 564 control chromosomes respectively. These altered amino acids were highly conserved. However, due to the lack of available parental DNA samples we were not able to determine if the sequence alterations were de novo. For PDGFRalpha, we found a single variant predicting p.L967V in a patient with CDH and multiple anomalies that was absent in 768 control chromosomes. This patient also had one cell with trisomy 15 on skin fibroblast culture, a finding of uncertain significance. Although our study identified sequence variants in FOG2 and PDGFRalpha, we have not definitively established the variants as mutations and we found no evidence that CDH commonly results from mutations in these genes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

19264732,Further clinical and molecular delineation of the 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome supports a major contribution of EHMT1 haploinsufficiency to the core phenotype.,"BACKGROUND: The 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome (9qSTDS) is clinically characterised by moderate to severe mental retardation, childhood hypotonia and facial dysmorphisms. In addition, congenital heart defects, urogenital defects, epilepsy and behavioural problems are frequently observed. The syndrome can be either caused by a submicroscopic 9q34.3 deletion or by intragenic EHMT1 mutations leading to haploinsufficiency of the EHMT1 gene. So far it has not been established if and to what extent other genes in the 9q34.3 region contribute to the phenotype observed in deletion cases. This study reports the largest cohort of 9qSTDS cases so far. METHODS AND RESULTS: By a multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) approach, the authors identified and characterised 16 novel submicroscopic 9q deletions. Direct sequence analysis of the EHMT1 gene in 24 patients exhibiting the 9qSTD phenotype without such deletion identified six patients with an intragenic EHMT1 mutation. Five of these mutations predict a premature termination codon whereas one mutation gives rise to an amino acid substitution in a conserved domain of the protein. CONCLUSIONS: The data do not provide any evidence for phenotype-genotype correlations between size of the deletions or type of mutations and severity of clinical features. Therefore, the authors confirm the EHMT1 gene to be the major determinant of the 9qSTDS phenotype. Interestingly, five of six patients who had reached adulthood had developed severe psychiatric pathology, which may indicate that EHMT1 haploinsufficiency is associated with neurodegeneration in addition to neurodevelopmental defect.",journal article
16459341,Mutations of human TMHS cause recessively inherited non-syndromic hearing loss.,"BACKGROUND:Approximately half the cases of prelingual hearing loss are caused by genetic factors. Identification of genes causing deafness is a crucial first step in understanding the normal function of these genes in the auditory system. Recently, a mutant allele of Tmhs was reported to be associated with deafness and circling behaviour in the hurry-scurry mouse. Tmhs encodes a predicted tetraspan protein of unknown function, which is expressed in inner ear hair cells. The human homologue of Tmhs is located on chromosome 6p. OBJECTIVE:To determine the cause of deafness in four consanguineous families segregating recessive deafness linked to markers on chromosome 6p21.1-p22.3 defining a novel DFNB locus. RESULTS:A novel locus for non-syndromic deafness DFNB67 was mapped in an interval of approximately 28.51 cM on human chromosome 6p21.1-p22.3. DNA sequence analysis of TMHS revealed a homozygous frameshift mutation (246delC) and a missense mutation (Y127C) in affected individuals of two families segregating non-syndromic deafness, one of which showed significant evidence of linkage to markers in the DFNB67 interval. The localisation of mTMHS in developing mouse inner ear hair cells was refined and found to be expressed briefly from E16.5 to P3.

Fine mapping excluded DFNB53 and subsequently homozygous mutations were identified in the lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) gene, also named tetraspan membrane protein of hair cell stereocilia (TMHS) gene, which was recently shown to be mutated in the ""hurry scurry"" mouse and in two DFNB67-linked families from Pakistan. In one family, we found a homozygous one-base pair deletion, c.649delG (p.Glu216ArgfsX26) and in the other family we identified a homozygous transition c.494C>T (p.Thr165Met). Further screening of index patients from 96 Turkish ARNSHL families and 90 Dutch ARNSHL patients identified one additional Turkish family carrying the c.649delG mutation. Haplotype analysis revealed that the c.649delG mutation was located on a common haplotype in both families. Mutation screening of the LHFPL5 homologs LHFPL3 and LHFPL4 did not reveal any disease causing mutation. Our findings indicate that LHFPL5 is essential for normal function of the human cochlea.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
26996948,Pathogenic Variants in PIGG Cause Intellectual Disability with Seizures and Hypotonia.,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a glycolipid that anchors >150 various proteins to the cell surface. At least 27 genes are involved in biosynthesis and transport of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). To date, mutations in 13 of these genes are known to cause inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), and all are inherited as recessive traits. IGDs mainly manifest as intellectual disability, epilepsy, coarse facial features, and multiple organ anomalies. These symptoms are caused by the decreased surface expression of GPI-APs or by structural abnormalities of GPI. Here, we present five affected individuals (from two consanguineous families from Egypt and Pakistan and one non-consanguineous family from Japan) who show intellectual disability, hypotonia, and early-onset seizures. We identified pathogenic variants in PIGG, a gene in the GPI pathway. In the consanguineous families, homozygous variants c.928C>T (p.Gln310(âˆ—)) and c.2261+1G>C were found, whereas the Japanese individual was compound heterozygous for c.2005C>T (p.Arg669Cys) and a 2.4 Mb deletion involving PIGG. PIGG is the enzyme that modifies the second mannose with ethanolamine phosphate, which is removed soon after GPI is attached to the protein. Physiological significance of this transient modification has been unclear. Using B lymphoblasts from affected individuals of the Egyptian and Japanese families, we revealed that PIGG activity was almost completely abolished; however, the GPI-APs had normal surface levels and normal structure, indicating that the pathogenesis of PIGG deficiency is not yet fully understood. The discovery of pathogenic variants in PIGG expands the spectrum of IGDs and further enhances our understanding of this etiopathogenic class of intellectual disability.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17442906,Targeted therapy for inherited GPI deficiency.,"Disrupted binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the mutated promoter region of the mannosyl transferase-encoding gene PIGM causes inherited glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) deficiency characterized by splanchnic vein thrombosis and epilepsy. We show that this results in histone hypoacetylation at the promoter of PIGM. The histone deacetylase inhibitor butyrate increases PIGM transcription and surface GPI expression in vitro as well as in vivo through enhanced histone acetylation in an Sp1-dependent manner. More important, the drug caused complete cessation of intractable seizures in a child with inherited GPI deficiency.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
15961413,Loss of function mutations in the gene encoding Omi/HtrA2 in Parkinson's disease.,"Recently targeted disruption of Omi/HtrA2 has been found to cause neurodegeneration and a parkinsonian phenotype in mice. Using a candidate gene approach, we performed a mutation screening of the Omi/HtrA2 gene in German Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. In four patients, we identified a novel heterozygous G399S mutation, which was absent in healthy controls. Moreover, we identified a novel A141S polymorphism that was associated with PD (P<0.05). Both mutations resulted in defective activation of the protease activity of Omi/HtrA2. Immunohistochemistry and functional analysis in stably transfected cells revealed that S399 mutant Omi/HtrA2 and to a lesser extent, the risk allele of the A141S polymorphism induced mitochondrial dysfunction associated with altered mitochondrial morphology. Cells overexpressing S399 mutant Omi/HtrA2 were more susceptible to stress-induced cell death than wild-type. On the basis of functional genomics, our results provide a novel link between mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in PD.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Here we define the composition of the human ribonuclease H2 enzyme complex and show that AGS can result from mutations in the genes encoding any one of its three subunits.

25585697,Dominant transmission of de novo KIF1A motor domain variant underlying pure spastic paraplegia.,"Variants in family 1 kinesin (KIF1A), which encodes a kinesin axonal motor protein, have been described to cause variable neurological manifestations. Recessive missense variants have led to spastic paraplegia, and recessive truncations to sensory and autonomic neuropathy. De novo missense variants cause developmental delay or intellectual disability, cerebellar atrophy and variable spasticity. We describe a family with father-to-son transmission of de novo variant in the KIF1A motor domain, in a phenotype of pure spastic paraplegia. Structural modeling of the predicted p.(Ser69Leu) amino acid change suggested that it impairs the stable binding of ATP to the KIF1A protein. Our study reports the first dominantly inherited KIF1A variant and expands the spectrum of phenotypes caused by heterozygous KIF1A motor domain variants to include pure spastic paraplegia. We conclude that KIF1A should be considered a candidate gene for hereditary paraplegias regardless of inheritance pattern.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
19878916,"Autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa caused by a mutation in SNRNP200, a gene required for unwinding of U4/U6 snRNAs.","Mutations in genes associated with the U4/U6-U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex of the spliceosome are implicated in autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a group of progressive retinal degenerative disorders leading to visual impairment, loss of visual field, and even blindness. We recently assigned a locus (RP33) for adRP to 2cen-q12.1, a region that harbors the SNRNP200 gene encoding hBrr2, another U4/U6-U5 snRNP component that is required for unwinding of U4/U6 snRNAs during spliceosome activation and for disassembly of the spliceosome. Here, we report the identification of a missense mutation, c.3260C>T (p.S1087L), in exon 25 of the SNRNP200 gene in an RP33-linked family. The c.3260C>T substitution showed complete cosegregation with the retinitis pigmentosa (RP) phenotype over four generations, but was absent in a panel of 400 controls. The p.S1087L mutation and p.R1090L, another adRP-associated allele, reside in the ""ratchet"" helix of the first of two Sec63 domains implicated in the directionality and processivity of nucleic acid unwinding. Indeed, marked defects in U4/U6 unwinding, but not U4/U6-U5 snRNP assembly, were observed in budding yeast for the analogous mutations (N1104L and R1107L) of the corresponding Brr2p residues. The linkage of hBrr2 to adRP suggests that the mechanism of pathogenesis for splicing-factor-related RP may fundamentally derive from a defect in hBrr2-dependent RNA unwinding and a consequent defect in spliceosome activation.",research-article; journal article
16885549,Activating mutations in the ABCC8 gene in neonatal diabetes mellitus.,"The ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, composed of the beta-cell proteins sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) and inward-rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.2, is a key regulator of insulin release. It is inhibited by the binding of adenine nucleotides to subunit Kir6.2, which closes the channel, and activated by nucleotide binding or hydrolysis on SUR1, which opens the channel. The balance of these opposing actions determines the low open-channel probability, P(O), which controls the excitability of pancreatic beta cells. We hypothesized that activating mutations in ABCC8, which encodes SUR1, cause neonatal diabetes.We screened the 39 exons of ABCC8 in 34 patients with permanent or transient neonatal diabetes of unknown origin. We assayed the electrophysiologic activity of mutant and wild-type K(ATP) channels.We identified seven missense mutations in nine patients. Four mutations were familial and showed vertical transmission with neonatal and adult-onset diabetes; the remaining mutations were not transmitted and not found in more than 300 patients without diabetes or with early-onset diabetes of similar genetic background. Mutant channels in intact cells and in physiologic concentrations of magnesium ATP had a markedly higher P(O) than did wild-type channels. These overactive channels remained sensitive to sulfonylurea, and treatment with sulfonylureas resulted in euglycemia.Dominant mutations in ABCC8 accounted for 12 percent of cases of neonatal diabetes in the study group. Diabetes results from a newly discovered mechanism whereby the basal magnesium-nucleotide-dependent stimulatory action of SUR1 on the Kir pore is elevated and blockade by sulfonylureas is preserved.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
12563048,Mevalonate kinase deficiency: enlarging the clinical and biochemical spectrum.,"OBJECTIVE:Mevalonic aciduria as a result of mevalonate kinase deficiency is an inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis characterized by dysmorphology, psychomotor retardation, progressive cerebellar ataxia, and recurrent febrile crises, usually manifesting in early infancy, accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and skin rash. The febrile crises are similar to those observed in hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS). Pathogenic mutations in the mevalonate kinase gene in both disorders have demonstrated a common genetic basis. Our aim was to describe the clinical picture of adolescent patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency and to expand the clinical and biochemical spectrum of mevalonate kinase deficiency, particularly with regard to HIDS. METHODS:We report the clinical history and biochemical findings of 3 patients with mevalonic aciduria. RESULTS:In 2 siblings with mevalonic aciduria, a 15-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy, the phenotype shifted with age. Ataxia has become the predominant clinical manifestation, whereas the febrile attacks occur less frequently but as yet have not disappeared. Both of them show marked elevations of immunoglobulin D (IgD). Psychomotor development is retarded but not regressive. Short stature developed in both patients. Additional findings include the development of retinal dystrophy and cataracts in both of them. The third patient is a 6-year-old boy who presented at the age of 5 years with cerebellar ataxia and retinal dystrophy. He is different from all known patients with mevalonic aciduria because of the mild neurologic involvement and because he has never developed febrile crises. In addition, levels of IgD were repeatedly normal. CONCLUSION:The clinical and biochemical spectrum of patients with mevalonic aciduria is heterogeneous. Manifestations of the disease seem to be age dependent, as evident from this first report of adolescent patients. In patients who survive infancy, short stature, ataxia caused by cerebellar atrophy, and ocular involvement with retinal dystrophy become predominant findings. Recurrent febrile crises seem to diminish with increasing age and may not even be an obligatory finding. Elevation of IgD is most likely a secondary phenomenon that seems to be linked to recurrent febrile crises.",journal article; case reports
15028672,"QRX, a novel homeobox gene, modulates photoreceptor gene expression.","A novel paired-like homeobox gene, designated as Qrx, was identified by a yeast one-hybrid screen using the bovine Rhodopsin promoter Ret-1 DNA regulatory element as bait. Qrx is preferentially expressed in both the outer and inner nuclear layers of the retina. Its homeodomain is nearly identical to that of Rx/Rax, a transcription factor that is essential for eye development, but it shares only limited homology elsewhere. Although Qrx and Rx/Rax show similar DNA binding properties in vitro, the two proteins demonstrate distinct target selectivity and functional behavior in promoter activity assays. QRX synergistically increases the transactivating function of the photoreceptor transcription factors Crx and NRL and it physically interacts with CRX. Qrx is present in the bovine and human genomes, but appears to be absent from the mouse genome. Nonetheless, a 5.8 kb upstream region of human QRX is capable of directing expression in presumptive photoreceptor precursor cells in transgenic mice. These results indicate that Qrx may be involved in modulating photoreceptor gene expression. In addition, the finding of rare heterozygous QRX sequence changes in three individuals with retinal degeneration raises the possibility that QRX may be involved in disease pathogenesis.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16960806,"CRYBA4, a novel human cataract gene, is also involved in microphthalmia.","Genetic analysis of a large Indian family with an autosomal dominant cataract phenotype allowed us to identify a novel cataract gene, CRYBA4. After a genomewide screen, linkage analysis identified a maximum LOD score of 3.20 (recombination fraction [theta] 0.001) with marker D22S1167 of the beta -crystallin gene cluster on chromosome 22. To date, CRYBA4 was the only gene in this cluster not associated with either human or murine cataracts. A pathogenic mutation was identified in exon 4 that segregated with the disease status. The c.317T-->C sequence change is predicted to replace the highly conserved hydrophobic amino acid phenylalanine94 with the hydrophilic amino acid serine. Modeling suggests that this substitution would significantly reduce the intrinsic stability of the crystalline monomer, which would impair its ability to form the association modes critical for lens transparency. Considering that CRYBA4 associates with CRYBB2 and that the latter protein has been implicated in microphthalmia, mutational analysis of CRYBA4 was performed in 32 patients affected with microphthalmia (small eye). We identified a c.242T-->C (Leu69Pro) sequence change in exon 4 in one patient, which is predicted here to disrupt the beta -sheet structure in CRYBA4. Protein folding would consequently be impaired, most probably leading to a structure with reduced stability in the mutant. This is the first report linking mutations in CRYBA4 to cataractogenesis and microphthalmia.",research-article; journal article
16960802,"Mutations in CABP4, the gene encoding the Ca2+-binding protein 4, cause autosomal recessive night blindness.","Mutations in genes encoding either components of the phototransduction cascade or proteins presumably involved in signaling from photoreceptors to adjacent second-order neurons have been shown to cause congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). Sequence alterations in CACNA1F lead to the incomplete type of CSNB (CSNB2), which can be distinguished by standard electroretinography (ERG). CSNB2 is associated with a reduced rod b-wave, a substantially reduced cone a-wave, and a reduced 30-Hz flicker ERG response. CACNA1F encodes the alpha 1-subunit of an L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.4 alpha ), which is specific to photoreceptors and is present at high density in the synaptic terminals. Ten of our patients with CSNB2 showed no mutation in CACNA1F. To identify the disease-causing mutations, we used a candidate-gene approach. CABP4, a member of the calcium-binding protein (CABP) family, is located in photoreceptor synaptic terminals and is directly associated with the C-terminal domain of the Cav1.4 alpha . Mice lacking either Cabp4 or Cav1.4 alpha display a CSNB2-like phenotype. Here, we report for the first time that mutations in CABP4 lead to autosomal recessive CSNB. Our studies revealed homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in two families. We also show that these mutations reduce the transcript levels to 30%-40% of those in controls. This suggests that the reduced amount of CABP4 is the reason for the signaling defect in these patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
16960801,Mutations in SLC34A2 cause pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis and are possibly associated with testicular microlithiasis.,"Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM) is a rare disease characterized by the deposition of calcium phosphate microliths throughout the lungs. We first identified a PAM locus by homozygosity mapping to 4p15, then identified, by a candidate-gene approach, the gene responsible for the disease as SLC34A2 (the type IIb sodium-phosphate cotransporter gene), which is involved in phosphate homeostasis in several organs. We identified six homozygous exonic mutations in the seven unrelated patients with PAM we studied. Three of the mutations were frameshifts, one was a chain termination, one was an amino acid substitution, and one was a deletion spanning the minimal promoter and the first exon. Absence of functional protein product of the gene is compatible with calcium phosphate deposition in alveolar airspaces. We show that impaired activity of the phosphate transporter is presumably responsible for the microliths and that PAM is a recessive monogenic disease with full penetrance. Testicular microlithiasis (TM) is a disease that is more common than PAM. It is often associated with cancer and infertility. Since the gene we identified is also expressed in testis, we searched for mutations in subjects with TM. In 2 of the 15 subjects with TM we studied, we identified two rare variants, one synonymous and the other noncoding, that are possibly associated with the condition.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Recent clinical delineation of this condition emphasises a typical facial appearance, cardiac and renal defects, and speech delay in addition to intellectual disability, hypotonia and seizures. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe 11 previously unreported patients expanding the phenotypic spectrum to include aortic root dilatation, recurrent joint subluxation, conductive hearing loss due to chronic otitis media, dental anomalies, and persistence of fetal fingertip pads. Molecular analysis of the deletions demonstrates a critical region spanning 440 kb involving either partially or wholly five genes, CRHR1, IMP5, MAPT, STH, and KIAA1267. CONCLUSION: These data have significant implications for the clinical diagnosis and management of other individuals with 17q21.31 deletions.",letter
20301783,Koolen-de Vries Syndrome,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS) is characterized by developmental delay / intellectual disability, neonatal/childhood hypotonia, dysmorphisms, congenital malformations, and behavioral features. Psychomotor developmental delay is noted in all individuals from an early age. The majority of individuals with KdVS function in the mild-to-moderate range of intellectual disability. Other findings include speech and language delay (100%), epilepsy (~33%), congenital heart defects (25%-50%), renal and urologic anomalies (25%-50%), and cryptorchidism (71% of males). Behavior in most is described as friendly, amiable, and cooperative. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of Koolen-de Vries syndrome is established in a proband who has either a heterozygous 500- to 650-kb deletion at chromosome 17q21.31 that includes KANSL1 or a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in KANSL1. Note: The 17q21.31 deletion cannot be identified by analysis of G-banded chromosomes or other cytogenetic banding techniques. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Physiotherapy for gross and fine motor delays; speech therapy to support early feeding challenges and communication development; educational programs directed to specific disabilities identified. Routine treatment of: vision issues / strabismus; hearing loss; cardiac, renal, and urologic problems; epilepsy; scoliosis, hip dislocation, and positional deformities of the feet; multiple nevi. Surveillance: Routine ophthalmologic examinations for hypermetropia and strabismus; monitoring for progressive spine deformities; routine monitoring for other medication complications depending on the organ system involved. GENETIC COUNSELING:Koolen-de Vries syndrome, caused by a deletion at 17q21.31 or a pathogenic variant in KANSL1, is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; to date almost all cases result from a de novo deletion or KANSL1 pathogenic variant. Thus, most affected individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family). The recurrence risk for future pregnancies is low (probably <1%) but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in one of the parents. Prenatal testing is technically feasible, but the likelihood of recurrence in families who have had an affected child is low.",book; review
18628315,Clinical and molecular delineation of the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome.,"The chromosome 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome is a novel genomic disorder that has originally been identified using high resolution genome analyses in patients with unexplained mental retardation.We report the molecular and/or clinical characterisation of 22 individuals with the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome.We estimate the prevalence of the syndrome to be 1 in 16,000 and show that it is highly underdiagnosed. Extensive clinical examination reveals that developmental delay, hypotonia, facial dysmorphisms including a long face, a tubular or pear-shaped nose and a bulbous nasal tip, and a friendly/amiable behaviour are the most characteristic features. Other clinically important features include epilepsy, heart defects and kidney/urologic anomalies. Using high resolution oligonucleotide arrays we narrow the 17q21.31 critical region to a 424 kb genomic segment (chr17: 41046729-41470954, hg17) encompassing at least six genes, among which is the gene encoding microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT). Mutation screening of MAPT in 122 individuals with a phenotype suggestive of 17q21.31 deletion carriers, but who do not carry the recurrent deletion, failed to identify any disease associated variants. In five deletion carriers we identify a <500 bp rearrangement hotspot at the proximal breakpoint contained within an L2 LINE motif and show that in every case examined the parent originating the deletion carries a common 900 kb 17q21.31 inversion polymorphism, indicating that this inversion is a necessary factor for deletion to occur (p<10(-5)).Our data establish the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome as a clinically and molecularly well recognisable genomic disorder.",research-article; journal article
7846071,Dark-light: model for nightblindness from the human rhodopsin Gly-90-->Asp mutation.,"A human rhodopsin mutation, Gly-90-->Asp (Gly90Asp), cosegregated with an unusual trait of congenital nightblindness in 22 at-risk members of a large autosomal dominant kindred. Although rhodopsin mutations typically are associated with retinal degeneration, Gly90Asp-affected subjects up to age 33 did not show clinical retinal changes. Absolute threshold for visual perception was elevated nearly 3 logarithmic units in 7 individuals tested (ages 11-64), indicating greatly compromised rod threshold signaling. However, in vivo rhodopsin density was normal. Although the 38-year-old proband could not perceive dim lights, his rod increment threshold function was normal on brighter backgrounds. The impaired rod vision for dim but not bright backgrounds is consistent with a mechanism of increased basal ""dark-light"" from thermal isomerization equivalent to an increase of > 10(4) over that of wild-type rhodopsin. The Gly90Asp mutation on the second transmembrane helix places an extra negative charge in the opsin pocket; this could contribute to partial deprotonation of the retinal Schiff base and thereby increase photoreceptor noise. In vitro evidence had suggested that transducin is activated by the Gly90Asp mutation in the absence of both the retinal chromophore and light, termed ""constitutive activity."" The apparent preservation of functioning rods despite extensive and lifelong night-blindness in this kindred is inconsistent with one current hypothesis that chronic rod activation from constitutively active mutant rhodopsin necessarily contributes significantly to photoreceptor demise in human retinal dystrophies.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
9888392,A novel mutation within the rhodopsin gene (Thr-94-Ile) causing autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness.,"More than 100 mutations within the rhodopsin gene have been found to be responsible for some forms of retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive retinal degeneration characterized by night blindness and subsequent disturbance of day vision that may eventually result in total blindness. Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is an uncommon inherited retinal dysfunction in which patients complain of night vision difficulties of a nonprogressive nature only and in which generally there is no involvement of day vision. We report the results of molecular genetic analysis of an Irish family segregating an autosomal dominant form of CSNB in which a previously unreported threonine-to-isoleucine substitution at codon 94 in the rhodopsin gene was found to segregate with the disease. Computer modeling suggests that constitutive activation of transducin by the altered rhodopsin protein may be a mechanism for disease causation in this family. Only two mutations within the rhodopsin gene have been previously reported in patients with congenital stationary night blindness, constitutive activation also having been proposed as a possible disease mechanism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17033974,Mutation in the auxiliary calcium-channel subunit CACNA2D4 causes autosomal recessive cone dystrophy.,"Retinal signal transmission depends on the activity of high voltage-gated l-type calcium channels in photoreceptor ribbon synapses. We recently identified a truncating frameshift mutation in the Cacna2d4 gene in a spontaneous mouse mutant with profound loss of retinal signaling and an abnormal morphology of ribbon synapses in rods and cones. The Cacna2d4 gene encodes an l-type calcium-channel auxiliary subunit of the alpha (2) delta type. Mutations in its human orthologue, CACNA2D4, were not yet known to be associated with a disease. We performed mutation analyses of 34 patients who received an initial diagnosis of night blindness, and, in two affected siblings, we detected a homozygous nucleotide substitution (c.2406C-->A) in CACNA2D4. The mutation introduces a premature stop codon that truncates one-third of the corresponding open reading frame. Both patients share symptoms of slowly progressing cone dystrophy. These findings represent the first report of a mutation in the human CACNA2D4 gene and define a novel gene defect that causes autosomal recessive cone dystrophy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; case-report"
15774581,Role of transcription factor KLF11 and its diabetes-associated gene variants in pancreatic beta cell function.,"KLF11 (TIEG2) is a pancreas-enriched transcription factor that has elicited significant attention because of its role as negative regulator of exocrine cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, its functional role in the endocrine pancreas remains to be established. Here, we report, for the first time, to our knowledge, the characterization of KLF11 as a glucose-inducible regulator of the insulin gene. A combination of random oligonucleotide binding, EMSA, luciferase reporter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays shows that KLF11 binds to the insulin promoter and regulates its activity in beta cells. Genetic analysis of the KLF11 gene revealed two rare variants (Ala347Ser and Thr220Met) that segregate with diabetes in families with early-onset type 2 diabetes, and significantly impair its transcriptional activity. In addition, analysis of 1,696 type 2 diabetes mellitus and 1,776 normoglycemic subjects show a frequent polymorphic Gln62Arg variant that significantly associates with type 2 diabetes mellitus in North European populations (OR = 1.29, P = 0.00033). Moreover, this variant alters the corepressor mSin3A-binding activity of KLF11, impairs the activation of the insulin promoter and shows lower levels of insulin expression in pancreatic beta cells. In addition, subjects carrying the Gln62Arg allele show decreased plasma insulin after an oral glucose challenge. Interestingly, all three nonsynonymous KLF11 variants show increased repression of the catalase 1 promoter, suggesting a role in free radical clearance that may render beta cells more sensitive to oxidative stress. Thus, both functional and genetic analyses reveal that KLF11 plays a role in the regulation of pancreatic beta cell physiology, and its variants may contribute to the development of diabetes.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
22652185,The role of saposin C in Gaucher disease.,"Saposin C is one of four homologous proteins derived from sequential cleavage of the saposin precursor protein, prosaposin. It is an essential activator for glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA gene that exhibits vast phenotypic heterogeneity, despite its designation as a ""simple"" Mendelian disorder. The observed phenotypic variability has led to a search for disease modifiers that can alter the Gaucher phenotype. The PSAP gene encoding saposin C is a prime candidate modifier for Gaucher disease. In humans, saposin C deficiency due to mutations in PSAP results in a Gaucher-like phenotype, despite normal in vitro glucocerebrosidase activity. Saposin C deficiency has also been shown to modify phenotype in one mouse model of Gaucher disease. The role of saposin C as an activator required for normal glucocerebrosidase function, and the consequences of saposin C deficiency are described, and are being explored as potential modifying factors in patients with Gaucher disease.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; review; journal article"
16783566,"Evidence for a new contiguous gene syndrome, the chromosome 16p13.3 deletion syndrome alias severe Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.","Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a well-known autosomal dominant mental retardation syndrome with typical facial and skeletal abnormalities. Previously, we have reported two patients presenting with RSTS and additional clinical features including failure to thrive, seizures, and intractable infections (Bartsch et al. in Eur J Hum Genet 7:748-756, 1999). Recently we identified a third patient with this condition, termed here severe RSTS, or chromosome 16p13.3 deletion syndrome. The three patients died in infancy, and all displayed a specific mutation, a chromosomal microdeletion including the 3'-end of the CREBBP gene. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and closely spaced DNA probes, we characterized the deletion intervals in these patients and in three individuals with a deletion of CREBBP and typical RSTS. The deleted DNA segments were found to greatly vary in size, spanning from approximately 40 kb to >3 Mb. Four individuals, including the patients with severe RSTS, exhibited deletions containing gene/s in addition to CREBBP. The patients with severe RSTS all had deletions comprising telomeric neighbor genes of CREBBP, including DNASE1, a dominant gene encoding a nuclease that has been associated with systemic lupus erythematodes. Our findings suggest that severe RSTS is distinct from RSTS and represents a novel true contiguous gene syndrome (chromosome 16p13.3 deletion syndrome). Because of the risk of critical infections and high mortality rate, we recommend that the size of the deletion interval should be determined in CREBBP deletion-positive patients with RSTS, especially in young children. Further studies are needed to delineate the clinical spectrum of the new disorder and to clarify the role of DNASE1.",journal article

Using FISH and microsatellite analyses as a first step in the CREBBP mutation screening of 42 Italian RSTS patients, we identified six deletions, three of which were in a mosaic condition that has not been previously reported in RSTS. The use of region-specific BAC clones and small CREBBP probes allowed us to assess the extent of all of the deletions by mapping their endpoints to genomic intervals of 5-10 kb. Four of our five intragenic breakpoints cluster at the 5' end of CREBBP, where there is a peak of breakpoints underlying rearrangements in RSTS patients and tumors. The search for genomic motifs did not reveal any low-copy repeats (LCRs) or any greater density of repetitive sequences. In contrast, the percentage of interspersed repetitive elements (mainly Alu and LINEs in the CREBBP exon 2 region) is significantly higher than that in the entire gene or the average in the genome, thus suggesting that this characteristic may be involved in the region's vulnerability to breaking and nonhomologous pairing. The FISH analysis extended to the EP300 genomic region did not reveal any deletions. The clinical presentation was typical in all cases, but more severe in the three patients carrying constitutional deletions, raising a question about the possible underdiagnosis of a few cases of mild RSTS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16973841,Herpes simplex virus encephalitis in human UNC-93B deficiency.,"Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) is the most common form of sporadic viral encephalitis in western countries. Its pathogenesis remains unclear, as it affects otherwise healthy patients and only a small minority of HSV-1-infected individuals. Here, we elucidate a genetic etiology for HSE in two children with autosomal recessive deficiency in the intracellular protein UNC-93B, resulting in impaired cellular interferon-alpha/beta and -lambda antiviral responses. HSE can result from a single-gene immunodeficiency that does not compromise immunity to most pathogens, unlike most known primary immunodeficiencies. Other severe infectious diseases may also reflect monogenic disorders of immunity.",review-article; review; journal article
20507925,Identification of a prevalent founder mutation in an Israeli Muslim Arab village confirms the role of PRCD in the aetiology of retinitis pigmentosa in humans.,"BACKGROUND: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common form of hereditary retinal degeneration. At least 32 genes and loci have been implicated in non-syndromic autosomal recessive RP. Progressive rod-cone degeneration is a canine form of autosomal recessive retinal degeneration, which serves as an animal model for human RP, and is caused by a missense mutation of the PRCD gene. The same homozygous PRCD mutation has been previously identified in a single human RP patient from Bangladesh. To date, this is the only RP-causing mutation of PRCD reported in humans. METHODS: The cause of the high incidence rate of autosomal recessive RP in an isolated Muslim Arab village in Northern Israel was investigated by haplotype analysis in affected families. The underlying mutation was detected by direct sequencing of the causative gene, and its prevalence in affected and unaffected individuals from the village was determined. Patients who were homozygotes for this mutation underwent ophthalmic evaluation, including funduscopy and electroretinography. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The identification of a novel pathogenic nonsense mutation of PRCD is reported. This founder mutation was found in a homozygous state in 18 patients from nine families, and its carrier frequency in the investigated village is 10%. The mutation is associated with a typical RP phenotype, including bone spicule-type pigment deposits and non-recordable electroretinograms. Additional findings include signs of macular degeneration and cataract. The identification of a second pathogenic mutation of PRCD in multiple RP patients confirms the role of PRCD in the aetiology of RP in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17186470,Ribosomal protein S24 gene is mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.,"Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital red-cell aplasia characterized by anemia, bone-marrow erythroblastopenia, and congenital anomalies and is associated with heterozygous mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) S19 gene (RPS19) in approximately 25% of probands. We report identification of de novo nonsense and splice-site mutations in another RP, RPS24 (encoded by RPS24 [10q22-q23]) in approximately 2% of RPS19 mutation-negative probands. This finding strongly suggests that DBA is a disorder of ribosome synthesis and that mutations in other RP or associated genes that lead to disrupted ribosomal biogenesis and/or function may also cause DBA.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural; case-report"
17160893,Infantile encephalopathy and defective mitochondrial DNA translation in patients with mutations of mitochondrial elongation factors EFG1 and EFTu.,"Mitochondrial protein translation is a complex process performed within mitochondria by an apparatus composed of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded RNAs and nuclear DNA-encoded proteins. Although the latter by far outnumber the former, the vast majority of mitochondrial translation defects in humans have been associated with mutations in RNA-encoding mtDNA genes, whereas mutations in protein-encoding nuclear genes have been identified in a handful of cases. Genetic investigation involving patients with defective mitochondrial translation led us to the discovery of novel mutations in the mitochondrial elongation factor G1 (EFG1) in one affected baby and, for the first time, in the mitochondrial elongation factor Tu (EFTu) in another one. Both patients were affected by severe lactic acidosis and rapidly progressive, fatal encephalopathy. The EFG1-mutant patient had early-onset Leigh syndrome, whereas the EFTu-mutant patient had severe infantile macrocystic leukodystrophy with micropolygyria. Structural modeling enabled us to make predictions about the effects of the mutations at the molecular level. Yeast and mammalian cell systems proved the pathogenic role of the mutant alleles by functional complementation in vivo. Nuclear-gene abnormalities causing mitochondrial translation defects represent a new, potentially broad field of mitochondrial medicine. Investigation of these defects is important to expand the molecular characterization of mitochondrial disorders and also may contribute to the elucidation of the complex control mechanisms, which regulate this fundamental pathway of mtDNA homeostasis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
17160903,"Nemaline myopathy with minicores caused by mutation of the CFL2 gene encoding the skeletal muscle actin-binding protein, cofilin-2.","Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a congenital myopathy characterized by muscle weakness and nemaline bodies in affected myofibers. Five NM genes, all encoding components of the sarcomeric thin filament, are known. We report identification of a sixth gene, CFL2, encoding the actin-binding protein muscle cofilin-2, which is mutated in two siblings with congenital myopathy. The proband's muscle contained characteristic nemaline bodies, as well as occasional fibers with minicores, concentric laminated bodies, and areas of F-actin accumulation. Her affected sister's muscle was reported to exhibit nonspecific myopathic changes. Cofilin-2 levels were significantly lower in the proband's muscle, and the mutant protein was less soluble when expressed in Escherichia coli, suggesting that deficiency of cofilin-2 may result in reduced depolymerization of actin filaments, causing their accumulation in nemaline bodies, minicores, and, possibly, concentric laminated bodies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural; case-report"
23995701,Distinct global shifts in genomic binding profiles of limb malformation-associated HOXD13 mutations.,"Gene regulation by transcription factors (TFs) determines developmental programs and cell identity. Consequently, mutations in TFs can lead to dramatic phenotypes in humans by disrupting gene regulation. To date, the molecular mechanisms that actually cause these phenotypes have been difficult to address experimentally. ChIP-seq, which couples chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing, allows TF function to be investigated on a genome-wide scale, enabling new approaches for the investigation of gene regulation. Here, we present the application of ChIP-seq to explore the effect of missense mutations in TFs on their genome-wide binding profile. Using a retroviral expression system in chicken mesenchymal stem cells, we elucidated the mechanism underlying a novel missense mutation in HOXD13 (Q317K) associated with a complex hand and foot malformation phenotype. The mutated glutamine (Q) is conserved in most homeodomains, a notable exception being bicoid-type homeodomains that have lysine (K) at this position. Our results show that the mutation results in a shift in the binding profile of the mutant toward a bicoid/PITX1 motif. Gene expression analysis and functional assays using in vivo overexpression studies confirm that the mutation results in a partial conversion of HOXD13 into a TF with bicoid/PITX1 properties. A similar shift was not observed with another mutation, Q317R, which is associated with brachysyndactyly, suggesting that the bicoid/PITX1-shift observed for Q317K might be related to the severe clinical phenotype. The methodology described can be used to investigate a wide spectrum of TFs and mutations that have not previously been amenable to ChIP-seq experiments.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
18952067,Novel mutations in the adipose triglyceride lipase gene causing neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy.,"A subgroup of neutral lipid storage disease has been recently associated with myopathy (NLSDM) and attributed to mutations in the gene (PNPLA2) encoding an adipose triglyceride lipase involved in the degradation of intracellular triglycerides. Five NLSDM patients have been described thus far and we reported three additional patients. A 44-year old Iranian woman and two Italian brothers, aged 40 and 35, presented with exercise intolerance and proximal limb weakness, elevated CK levels, and Jordan's anomaly. Muscle biopsies showed marked neutral lipid accumulation in all patients. The 10 exons and the intron-exon junctions of the PNPLA2 gene were sequenced. Two novel homozygous mutations in exon 5 of PNPLA2 gene were found (c.695delT and c.542delAC). Both mutations resulted in frameshifts leading to premature stop codons (p.L255X and p.I212X, respectively). These mutations predict a truncated PNPLA2 protein lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic domain. These findings indicate that NLSDM is rare, but genetically heterogeneous.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
17236136,Genomewide scan for linkage reveals evidence of several susceptibility loci for alopecia areata.,"Alopecia areata (AA) is a genetically determined, immune-mediated disorder of the hair follicle that affects 1%-2% of the U.S. population. It is defined by a spectrum of severity that ranges from patchy localized hair loss on the scalp to the complete absence of hair everywhere on the body. In an effort to define the genetic basis of AA, we performed a genomewide search for linkage in 20 families with AA consisting of 102 affected and 118 unaffected individuals from the United States and Israel. Our analysis revealed evidence of at least four susceptibility loci on chromosomes 6, 10, 16 and 18, by use of several different statistical approaches. Fine-mapping analysis with additional families yielded a maximum multipoint LOD score of 3.93 on chromosome 18, a two-point affected sib pair (ASP) LOD score of 3.11 on chromosome 16, several ASP LOD scores >2.00 on chromosome 6q, and a haplotype-based relative risk LOD of 2.00 on chromosome 6p (in the major histocompatibility complex locus). Our findings confirm previous studies of association of the human leukocyte antigen locus with human AA, as well as the C3H-HeJ mouse model for AA. Interestingly, the major loci on chromosomes 16 and 18 coincide with loci for psoriasis reported elsewhere. These results suggest that these regions may harbor gene(s) involved in a number of different skin and hair disorders.",research-article; review; journal article
11443545,"Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome with a nucleotide excision-repair defect and a mutated XPD gene, with prenatal diagnosis in a triplet pregnancy.","Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome is a recessively inherited rapidly progressive neurologic disorder leading to brain atrophy, with calcifications, cataracts, microcornea, optic atrophy, progressive joint contractures, and growth failure. Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by low to normal birth weight, growth failure, brain dysmyelination with calcium deposits, cutaneous photosensitivity, pigmentary retinopathy and/or cataracts, and sensorineural hearing loss. Cultured CS cells are hypersensitive to UV radiation, because of impaired nucleotide-excision repair (NER) of UV-induced damage in actively transcribed DNA, whereas global genome NER is unaffected. The abnormalities in CS are caused by mutated CSA or CSB genes. Another class of patients with CS symptoms have mutations in the XPB, XPD, or XPG genes, which result in UV hypersensitivity as well as defective global NER; such patients may concurrently have clinical features of another NER syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Clinically observed similarities between COFS syndrome and CS have been followed by discoveries of cases of COFS syndrome that are associated with mutations in the XPG and CSB genes. Here we report the first involvement of the XPD gene in a new case of UV-sensitive COFS syndrome, with heterozygous substitutions-a R616W null mutation (previously seen in patients in XP complementation group D) and a unique D681N mutation-demonstrating that a third gene can be involved in COFS syndrome. We propose that COFS syndrome be included within the already known spectrum of NER disorders: XP, CS, and trichothiodystrophy. We predict that future patients with COFS syndrome will be found to have mutations in the CSA or XPB genes, and we document successful use of DNA repair for prenatal diagnosis in triplet and singleton pregnancies at risk for COFS syndrome. This result strongly underlines the need for screening of patients with COFS syndrome, for either UV sensitivity or DNA-repair abnormalities.",research-article; journal article; case reports
25655089,De novo heterozygous mutations in SMC3 cause a range of Cornelia de Lange syndrome-overlapping phenotypes.,"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is characterized by facial dysmorphism, growth failure, intellectual disability, limb malformations, and multiple organ involvement. Mutations in five genes, encoding subunits of the cohesin complex (SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21) and its regulators (NIPBL, HDAC8), account for at least 70% of patients with CdLS or CdLS-like phenotypes. To date, only the clinical features from a single CdLS patient with SMC3 mutation has been published. Here, we report the efforts of an international research and clinical collaboration to provide clinical comparison of 16 patients with CdLS-like features caused by mutations in SMC3. Modeling of the mutation effects on protein structure suggests a dominant-negative effect on the multimeric cohesin complex. When compared with typical CdLS, many SMC3-associated phenotypes are also characterized by postnatal microcephaly but with a less distinctive craniofacial appearance, a milder prenatal growth retardation that worsens in childhood, few congenital heart defects, and an absence of limb deficiencies. While most mutations are unique, two unrelated affected individuals shared the same mutation but presented with different phenotypes. This work confirms that de novo SMC3 mutations account for ∼ 1%-2% of CdLS-like phenotypes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; multicenter study; journal article"
17273969,Mutations in cohesin complex members SMC3 and SMC1A cause a mild variant of cornelia de Lange syndrome with predominant mental retardation.,"Mutations in the cohesin regulators NIPBL and ESCO2 are causative of the Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) and Roberts or SC phocomelia syndrome, respectively. Recently, mutations in the cohesin complex structural component SMC1A have been identified in two probands with features of CdLS. Here, we report the identification of a mutation in the gene encoding the complementary subunit of the cohesin heterodimer, SMC3, and 14 additional SMC1A mutations. All mutations are predicted to retain an open reading frame, and no truncating mutations were identified. Structural analysis of the mutant SMC3 and SMC1A proteins indicate that all are likely to produce functional cohesin complexes, but we posit that they may alter their chromosome binding dynamics. Our data indicate that SMC3 and SMC1A mutations (1) contribute to approximately 5% of cases of CdLS, (2) result in a consistently mild phenotype with absence of major structural anomalies typically associated with CdLS, and (3) in some instances, result in a phenotype that approaches that of apparently nonsyndromic mental retardation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural; case-report"

We identified a homozygous mutation--c.215G-->A (p.Gly72Glu)--in the alternatively spliced exon 3A of this enzyme in two siblings with lactic acidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and muscular hypotonia who died within the 1st year of life. Functional investigation of intact mitochondria showed a deficiency of ATP synthesis in muscle but not in fibroblasts, which correlated with the tissue-specific expression of exon 3A in muscle versus exon 3B in fibroblasts. The enzyme defect was confirmed by complementation analysis in yeast. This is the first report of patients with mitochondrial phosphate-carrier deficiency.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; case-report"
11941477,"Mutations in PATCHED-1, the receptor for SONIC HEDGEHOG, are associated with holoprosencephaly.","Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most commonly occurring congenital structural forebrain anomaly in humans. HPE is associated with mental retardation and craniofacial malformations. The genetic causes of HPE have recently begun to be identified, and we have previously shown that HPE can be caused by haploinsufficiency for SONIC HEDGEHOG ( SHH). We hypothesize that mutations in genes encoding other components of the SHH signaling pathway could also be associated with HPE. PATCHED-1 (PTCH), the receptor for SHH, normally acts to repress SHH signaling. This repression is relieved when SHH binds to PTCH. We analyzed PTCH as a candidate gene for HPE. Four different mutations in PTCHwere detected in five unrelated affected individuals. We predict that by enhancing the repressive activity of PTCH on the SHH pathway, these mutations cause decreased SHH signaling, and HPE results. The mutations could affect the ability of PTCH to bind SHH or perturb the intracellular interactions of PTCH with other proteins involved in SHH signaling. These findings further demonstrate the genetic heterogeneity associated with HPE, as well as showing that mutations in different components of a single signaling pathway can result in the same clinical condition.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
18830227,PTCH1 duplication in a family with microcephaly and mild developmental delay.,"With the exception of the X chromosome, genomic deletions appear to be more prevalent than duplications. Because of a lack of accurate diagnostic methods, submicroscopic duplications have been under-ascertained for a long period. The development of array CGH has enabled the detection of chromosomal microduplications with nearly the same sensitivity as deletions, leading to the discovery of previously unrecognized syndromes. Using a clinical targeted oligonucleotide array (CMA-V6.3 OLIGO), we identified an approximately 360-kb duplication in 9q22.32 in a 21-month-old boy with developmental delay, failure to thrive, and microcephaly. The same duplication was identified in the patient's mother who is also microcephalic and mildly delayed. We have sequenced the chromosomal breakpoints and determined the duplication as tandem in orientation and 363 599 bp in size. The duplicated segment harbors the entire PTCH1 gene. Deletions or loss-of-function mutations of PTCH1 result in basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome), whereas gain-of-function mutations were proposed to lead to holoprosencephaly 7. We propose that patients with microcephaly or holoprosencephaly of unknown origin should also be screened for PTCH1 duplication.",brief-report; journal article

Two patients had the same mutation (Val908Gly), but were phenotypically different: alobar holoprosencephaly, absent nasal septum, and midline cleft lip-palate in one case, and lobar holoprosencephaly, macrocephaly, hypertelorism, clefting of the nose, severe microphthalmia, and a single maxillary central incisor in the other. One of our patients had a Thr1052Met mutation, holoprosencephaly-like facial features, and a normal MRI. Ming et al.

This diversity of phenotypes expands our understanding. Findings include not only (1) holoprosencephaly or a holoprosencephaly-like phenotype, but also (2) heminasal aplasia with orbital anomalies, and (3) branchial arch anomalies of the type seen in hemifacial microsomia with anophthalmia and in oculoauriculofrontonasal syndrome.

14581620,Loss-of-function mutations in the human GLI2 gene are associated with pituitary anomalies and holoprosencephaly-like features.,"Diminished Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling is associated with the most common forebrain defect in humans, holoprosencephaly (HPE), which includes cyclopia, a phenotype also seen in mice and other vertebrates with defective Shh signaling. The secreted protein Shh acts as a crucial factor that patterns the ventral forebrain and is required for the division of the primordial eye field and brain into two discrete halves. Gli2 is one of three vertebrate transcription factors implicated as obligatory mediators of Shh signal transduction. Here, we show that loss-of-function mutations in the human GLI2 gene are associated with a distinctive phenotype (within the HPE spectrum) whose primary features include defective anterior pituitary formation and pan-hypopituitarism, with or without overt forebrain cleavage abnormalities, and HPE-like midfacial hypoplasia. We also demonstrate that these mutations lack GLI2 activity. We report on a functional association between GLI2 and human disease and highlight the role of GLI2 in human head development.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

17110937,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like phenotype with cutis laxa and multiple coagulation factor deficiency represents a separate genetic entity.,"Data on six patients with a Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE)-like phenotype, characterized by excessive skin folding (resembling cutis laxa) and a deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X) are presented. A comparison is made between the clinical, ultrastructural, and molecular findings in these patients and those seen in classic PXE and cutis laxa, respectively. Clinical overlap with PXE is obvious from the skin manifestations of yellowish papules or leathery plaques with dot-like depressions at presentation, angioid streaks and/or ocular peau d'orange, and fragmentation and calcification of elastic fibers in the dermis. Important phenotypic differences with PXE include much more severe skin laxity with spreading toward the trunk and limbs with thick, leathery skin folds rather than confinement to flexural areas, and no decrease in visual acuity. Moreover, detailed electron microscopic analyses revealed that alterations of elastic fibers as well as their mineralization were slightly different from those in classic PXE. Molecular analysis revealed neither causal mutations in the ABCC6 gene (ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6), which is responsible for PXE, nor in VKORC1 (vitamin K 2,3 epoxide reductase), known to be involved in vitamin K-dependent factor deficiency. However, the GGCX gene (gamma-glutamyl carboxylase), encoding an enzyme important for gamma-carboxylation of gla-proteins, harbored mutations in six out of seven patients analyzed. These findings all support the hypothesis that the disorder indeed represents a separate clinical and genetic entity, the molecular background of which remains to be unraveled.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18800149,Mutations in the GGCX and ABCC6 genes in a family with pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like phenotypes.,"A characteristic feature of classic pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene, is aberrant mineralization of connective tissues, particularly the elastic fibers. Here, we report a family with PXE-like cutaneous features in association with multiple coagulation factor deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with GGCX mutations. The proband and her sister, both with severe skin findings with extensive mineralization, were compound heterozygotes for missense mutations in the GGCX gene, which were shown to result in reduced gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity and in undercarboxylation of matrix gla protein. The proband's mother and aunt, also manifesting with PXE-like skin changes, were heterozygous carriers of a missense mutation (p.V255M) in GGCX and a null mutation (p.R1141X) in the ABCC6 gene, suggesting digenic nature of their skin findings. Thus, reduced gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity in individuals either compound heterozygous for a missense mutation in GGCX or with haploinsufficiency in GGCX in combination with heterozygosity for ABCC6 gene expression results in aberrant mineralization of skin leading to PXE-like phenotype. These findings expand the molecular basis of PXE-like phenotypes, and suggest a role for multiple genetic factors in pathologic tissue mineralization in general.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17357069,Disruption of ROBO2 is associated with urinary tract anomalies and confers risk of vesicoureteral reflux.,"Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) include vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). VUR is a complex, genetically heterogeneous developmental disorder characterized by the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureter and is associated with reflux nephropathy, the cause of 15% of end-stage renal disease in children and young adults. We investigated a man with a de novo translocation, 46,X,t(Y;3)(p11;p12)dn, who exhibits multiple congenital abnormalities, including severe bilateral VUR with ureterovesical junction defects. This translocation disrupts ROBO2, which encodes a transmembrane receptor for SLIT ligand, and produces dominant-negative ROBO2 proteins that abrogate SLIT-ROBO signaling in vitro. In addition, we identified two novel ROBO2 intracellular missense variants that segregate with CAKUT and VUR in two unrelated families. Adult heterozygous and mosaic mutant mice with reduced Robo2 gene dosage also exhibit striking CAKUT-VUR phenotypes. Collectively, these results implicate the SLIT-ROBO signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of a subset of human VUR.",comparative study; research-article; journal article

We previously described seven subjects with dup(17)(p11.2p11.2) and noted their relatively mild phenotype compared with that of individuals with SMS. Here, we molecularly analyzed 28 additional patients, using multiple independent assays, and also report the phenotypic characteristics obtained from extensive multidisciplinary clinical study of a subset of these patients. Whereas the majority of subjects (22 of 35) harbor the homologous recombination reciprocal product of the common SMS microdeletion (~3.7 Mb), 13 subjects (~37%) have nonrecurrent duplications ranging in size from 1.3 to 15.2 Mb. Molecular studies suggest potential mechanistic differences between nonrecurrent duplications and nonrecurrent genomic deletions. Clinical features observed in patients with the common dup(17)(p11.2p11.2) are distinct from those seen with SMS and include infantile hypotonia, failure to thrive, mental retardation, autistic features, sleep apnea, and structural cardiovascular anomalies. We narrow the critical region to a 1.3-Mb genomic interval that contains the dosage-sensitive RAI1 gene. Our results refine the critical region for Potocki-Lupski syndrome, provide information to assist in clinical diagnosis and management, and lend further support for the concept that genomic architecture incites genomic instability.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17287477,GM-CSF autoantibodies and neutrophil dysfunction in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.,"BACKGROUND: Increased mortality from infection in patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis occurs in association with high levels of autoantibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We tested the hypothesis that neutrophil functions are impaired in patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and that GM-CSF autoantibodies cause the dysfunction. METHODS: We studied 12 subjects with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, 61 healthy control subjects, and 12 control subjects with either cystic fibrosis or end-stage liver disease. We also studied GM-CSF-/- mice and wild-type mice. We evaluated basal neutrophil functions, neutrophil functions after priming by GM-CSF to augment antimicrobial functions, and the effects of highly purified GM-CSF autoantibodies on neutrophil functions in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Neutrophils from subjects with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis had normal ultrastructure and differentiation markers but impaired basal functions and antimicrobial functions after GM-CSF priming. GM-CSF-/- mice also had reduced basal neutrophil functions, but functions after GM-CSF priming were unimpaired. The neutrophil dysfunction characteristic of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis was reproduced in a dose-dependent fashion in blood specimens from healthy control subjects after incubation with affinity-purified GM-CSF autoantibodies isolated from patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The injection of mouse GM-CSF antibodies into wild-type mice also caused neutrophil dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial functions of neutrophils are impaired in patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, owing to the presence of GM-CSF autoantibodies. The effects of these autoantibodies show that GM-CSF is an essential regulator of neutrophil functions.","journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

Old clinical classification based on age of onset is now being revisited with the quickly accumulating knowledge of the various genetic defects that underlie this group of genetically heterogeneous disorders. We report our linkage data on a family with late-infantile NCL and show that the disease in this family is due to a homozygous novel mutation in the most recently described NCL gene (MFSD8). We use clinical data from our patients and the few others that have previously been reported to delineate the phenotype associated with mutations in this gene. We conclude that the phenotype is fairly consistent, which is a helpful guide to clinicians as they decide on the most cost-effective molecular testing strategies for NCLs.",journal article
23408678,Phenotypic variability of osteogenesis imperfecta type V caused by an IFITM5 mutation.,"In a large cohort of osteogenesis imperfecta type V (OI type V) patients (17 individuals from 12 families), we identified the same mutation in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5) gene by whole exome and Sanger sequencing (IFITM5 c.-14C > T) and provide a detailed description of their phenotype. This mutation leads to the creation of a novel start codon adding five residues to IFITM5 and was recently reported in several other OI type V families. The variability of the phenotype was quite large even within families. Whereas some patients presented with the typical calcification of the forearm interosseous membrane, radial head dislocation and hyperplastic callus (HPC) formation following fractures, others had only some of the typical OI type V findings. Thirteen had calcification of interosseous membranes, 14 had radial head dislocations, 10 had HPC, 9 had long bone bowing, 11 could ambulate without assistance, and 1 had mild unilateral mixed hearing loss. The bone mineral density varied greatly, even within families. Our study thus highlights the phenotypic variability of OI type V caused by the IFITM5 mutation.","clinical trial; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; multicenter study; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
24714694,Comprehensive genotyping and clinical characterisation reveal 27 novel NKX2-1 mutations and expand the phenotypic spectrum.,"BACKGROUND:NKX2-1 encodes a transcription factor with large impact on the development of brain, lung and thyroid. Germline mutations of NKX2-1 can lead to dysfunction and malformations of these organs. Starting from the largest coherent collection of patients with a suspected phenotype to date, we systematically evaluated frequency, quality and spectrum of phenotypic consequences of NKX2-1 mutations. METHODS:After identifying mutations by Sanger sequencing and array CGH, we comprehensively reanalysed the phenotype of affected patients and their relatives. We employed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to detect alterations of NKX2-1 DNA binding. Gene expression was monitored by means of in situ hybridisation and compared with the expression level of MBIP, a candidate gene presumably involved in the disorders and closely located in close genomic proximity to NKX2-1. RESULTS:Within 101 index patients, we detected 17 point mutations and 10 deletions. Neurological symptoms were the most consistent finding (100%), followed by lung affection (78%) and thyroidal dysfunction (75%). Novel symptoms associated with NKX2-1 mutations comprise abnormal height, bouts of fever and cardiac septum defects. In contrast to previous reports, our data suggest that missense mutations in the homeodomain of NKX2-1 not necessarily modify its DNA binding capacity and that this specific type of mutations may be associated with mild pulmonary phenotypes such as asthma. Two deletions did not include NKX2-1, but MBIP, whose expression spatially and temporarily coincides with NKX2-1 in early murine development. CONCLUSIONS:The high incidence of NKX2-1 mutations strongly recommends the routine screen for mutations in patients with corresponding symptoms. However, this analysis should not be confined to the exonic sequence alone, but should take advantage of affordable NGS technology to expand the target to adjacent regulatory sequences and the NKX2-1 interactome in order to maximise the yield of this diagnostic effort.",research-article; journal article
17522105,"Polyhydramnios, megalencephaly and symptomatic epilepsy caused by a homozygous 7-kilobase deletion in LYK5.","We used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to investigate the cause of a symptomatic epilepsy syndrome in a group of seven distantly related Old Order Mennonite children. Autozygosity mapping was inconclusive, but closer inspection of the data followed by formal SNP copy number analyses showed that all affected patients had homozygous deletions of a single SNP (rs721575) and their parents were hemizygous for this marker. The deleted SNP marked a larger deletion encompassing exons 9-13 of LYK5, which encodes STE20-related adaptor protein, a pseudokinase necessary for proper localization and function of serine/threonine kinase 11 (a.k.a. LKB1). Homozygous LYK5 deletions were associated with polyhydramnios, preterm labour and distinctive craniofacial features. Affected children had large heads, infantile-onset intractable multifocal seizures and severe psychomotor retardation. We designated this condition PMSE syndrome (polyhydramnios, megalencephaly and symptomatic epilepsy). Thirty-eight percent (N = 16) of affected children died during childhood (ages 7 months to 6 years) from medical complications of the disorder, which included status epilepticus, congestive heart failure due to atrial septal defect and hypernatremic dehydration due to diabetes insipidus. A single post-mortem neuropathological study revealed megalencephaly, ventriculomegaly, cytomegaly and extensive vacuolization and astrocytosis of white matter. There was abundant anti-phospho-ribosomal S6 labelling of large cells within the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus and spinal cord, consistent with constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway in brain.","journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17564974,Pleiotropic effects of CEP290 (NPHP6) mutations extend to Meckel syndrome.,"Meckel syndrome (MKS) is a rare autosomal recessive lethal condition characterized by central nervous system malformations, polydactyly, multicystic kidney dysplasia, and ductal changes of the liver. Three loci have been mapped (MKS1-MKS3), and two genes have been identified (MKS1/FLJ20345 and MKS3/TMEM67), whereas the gene at the MKS2 locus remains unknown. To identify new MKS loci, a genomewide linkage scan was performed using 10-cM-resolution microsatellite markers in eight families. The highest heterogeneity LOD score was obtained for chromosome 12, in an interval containing CEP290, a gene recently identified as causative of Joubert syndrome (JS) and isolated Leber congenital amaurosis. In view of our recent findings of allelism, at the MKS3 locus, between these two disorders, CEP290 was considered a candidate, and homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutations were identified in four families. Sequencing of additional cases identified CEP290 mutations in two fetuses with MKS and in four families presenting a cerebro-reno-digital syndrome, with a phenotype overlapping MKS and JS, further demonstrating that MKS and JS can be variable expressions of the same ciliopathy. These data identify a fourth locus for MKS (MKS4) and the CEP290 gene as responsible for MKS.",research-article; journal article
17220172,A new inborn error of glycosylation due to a Cog8 deficiency reveals a critical role for the Cog1-Cog8 interaction in COG complex formation.,"The hetero-octameric conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is essential for the structure/function of the Golgi apparatus through regulation of membrane trafficking. Here, we describe a patient with a mild form of a congenital disorder of glycosylation type II (CDG-II), which is caused by a homozygous nonsense mutation in the hCOG8 gene. This leads to a premature stop codon resulting in a truncated Cog8 subunit lacking the 76 C-terminal amino acids. Mass spectrometric analysis of the N- and O-glycan structures identified a mild sialylation deficiency. We showed that the molecular basis of this defect in N- and O-glycosylation is caused by the disruption of the Cog1-Cog8 interaction due to truncation. As a result, Cog1 deficiency accompanies the Cog8 deficiency, preventing assembly of the intact, stable complex and resulting in the appearance of smaller subcomplexes. Moreover, levels of beta1,4-galactosytransferase were significantly reduced. The defects in O-glycosylation could be fully restored by transfecting the patient's fibroblasts with full-length Cog8. The Cog8 defect described here represents a novel type of CDG-II, which we propose to name as CDG-IIh or CDG caused by Cog8 deficiency (CDG-II/Cog8).","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
28619360,Further delineation of COG8-CDG: A case with novel compound heterozygous mutations diagnosed by targeted exome sequencing.,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a rapidly expanding group of inherited metabolic disorders with highly variable clinical presentations caused by deficient glycosylation of proteins and/or lipids. CDG-IIh is a very rare subgroup of CDG caused by mutations in the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex gene, COG8, and so far, only two cases have been reported in the medical literature. Here, we describe an 8-year-old Korean boy with psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, failure to thrive, elevated serum liver enzymes, microcephaly, and talipes equinovarus. A liver biopsy of the patient showed only interface hepatitis with mild lobular activity, and brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebellar atrophy. Compared with the previous two reported cases, our patient showed relatively mild psychomotor retardation without a seizure history. The transferrin isoelectric focusing profiles in the patient showed a CDG type II pattern with increased disialo- and trisialo-transferrin. Targeted exome sequencing was performed to screen all CDG type II-related genes, and two novel frameshift mutations were found: c.171dupG (p.Leu58Alafs*29) and c.1656dupC (p.Ala553Argfs*15) in COG8. The parents were heterozygous carriers of each variant. CDG should be included in the initial differential diagnosis for children with a suspected unknown syndrome or unclassified inherited metabolic disorder or children with diverse clinical presentations, such as psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, skeletal deformity, microcephaly, cerebellar atrophy, and unexplained transient elevated liver enzyme.",journal article; case reports
17331980,COG8 deficiency causes new congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIh.,"We describe a new Type II congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG-II) caused by mutations in the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex gene, COG8. The patient has severe psychomotor retardation, seizures, failure to thrive and intolerance to wheat and dairy products. Analysis of serum transferrin and total serum N-glycans showed normal addition of one sialic acid, but severe deficiency in subsequent sialylation of mostly normal N-glycans. Patient fibroblasts were deficient in sialylation of both N- and O-glycans, and also showed slower brefeldin A (BFA)-induced disruption of the Golgi matrix, reminiscent of COG7-deficient cells. Patient fibroblasts completely lacked COG8 protein and had reduced levels and/or mislocalization of several other COG proteins. The patient had two COG8 mutations which severely truncated the protein and destabilized the COG complex. The first, IVS3 + 1G > A, altered the conserved splicing site of intron 3, and the second deleted two nucleotides (1687-1688 del TT) in exon 5, truncating the last 47 amino acids. Lentiviral-mediated complementation with normal COG8 corrected mislocalization of other COG proteins, normalized sialylation and restored normal BFA-induced Golgi disruption. We propose to call this new disorder CDG-IIh or CDG-II/COG8.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17572665,Mutation of FIG4 causes neurodegeneration in the pale tremor mouse and patients with CMT4J.,"Membrane-bound phosphoinositides are signalling molecules that have a key role in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells. Proteins that bind specific phosphoinositides mediate interactions between membrane-bounded compartments whose identity is partially encoded by cytoplasmic phospholipid tags. Little is known about the localization and regulation of mammalian phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), a phospholipid present in small quantities that regulates membrane trafficking in the endosome-lysosome axis in yeast. Here we describe a multi-organ disorder with neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system, peripheral neuronopathy and diluted pigmentation in the 'pale tremor' mouse. Positional cloning identified insertion of ETn2beta (early transposon 2beta) into intron 18 of Fig4 (A530089I17Rik), the homologue of a yeast SAC (suppressor of actin) domain PtdIns(3,5)P2 5-phosphatase located in the vacuolar membrane. The abnormal concentration of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in cultured fibroblasts from pale tremor mice demonstrates the conserved biochemical function of mammalian Fig4. The cytoplasm of fibroblasts from pale tremor mice is filled with large vacuoles that are immunoreactive for LAMP-2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2), consistent with dysfunction of the late endosome-lysosome axis. Neonatal neurodegeneration in sensory and autonomic ganglia is followed by loss of neurons from layers four and five of the cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei and other localized brain regions. The sciatic nerve exhibits reduced numbers of large-diameter myelinated axons, slowed nerve conduction velocity and reduced amplitude of compound muscle action potentials. We identified pathogenic mutations of human FIG4 (KIAA0274) on chromosome 6q21 in four unrelated patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. This novel form of autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorder is designated CMT4J.",review-article; review; journal article
17668378,"Mutations in cardiac T-box factor gene TBX20 are associated with diverse cardiac pathologies, including defects of septation and valvulogenesis and cardiomyopathy.","The T-box family transcription factor gene TBX20 acts in a conserved regulatory network, guiding heart formation and patterning in diverse species. Mouse Tbx20 is expressed in cardiac progenitor cells, differentiating cardiomyocytes, and developing valvular tissue, and its deletion or RNA interference-mediated knockdown is catastrophic for heart development. TBX20 interacts physically, functionally, and genetically with other cardiac transcription factors, including NKX2-5, GATA4, and TBX5, mutations of which cause congenital heart disease (CHD). Here, we report nonsense (Q195X) and missense (I152M) germline mutations within the T-box DNA-binding domain of human TBX20 that were associated with a family history of CHD and a complex spectrum of developmental anomalies, including defects in septation, chamber growth, and valvulogenesis. Biophysical characterization of wild-type and mutant proteins indicated how the missense mutation disrupts the structure and function of the TBX20 T-box. Dilated cardiomyopathy was a feature of the TBX20 mutant phenotype in humans and mice, suggesting that mutations in developmental transcription factors can provide a sensitized template for adult-onset heart disease. Our findings are the first to link TBX20 mutations to human pathology. They provide insights into how mutation of different genes in an interactive regulatory circuit lead to diverse clinical phenotypes, with implications for diagnosis, genetic screening, and patient follow-up.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17431681,A novel genetic locus for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy at chromosome 5q12-q14.,"Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a clinically well-defined, age-related common idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome with substantial genetic basis to its etiology. We report identification of a novel epilepsy locus at chromosome 5q12-q14 in a family exhibiting autosomal dominant form of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy from south India. The highest two-point LOD score of 3.3344 was obtained for the microsatellite markers D5S641 and D5S459 at 5q14. Centromeric and telomeric chromosomal boundaries of the locus were defined by D5S624 and D5S428, respectively. The 5q12-q14 locus encompasses about 25 megabases of the genomic region and harbours several candidate genes. Further work involving a detailed mutational analysis of the locus, to isolate the gene responsible for the epilepsy disorder in the family, shall help enhance our understanding of molecular basis of epilepsy disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17701898,"Lethal contractural syndrome type 3 (LCCS3) is caused by a mutation in PIP5K1C, which encodes PIPKI gamma of the phophatidylinsitol pathway.","Lethal congenital contractural syndrome (LCCS) is a severe form of arthrogryposis. To date, two autosomal recessive forms of the disease (LCCS and LCCS2) have been described and mapped to chromosomes 9q34 and 12q13, respectively. We now describe a third LCCS phenotype (LCCS3)--similar to LCCS2 yet without neurogenic bladder. Using 10K single-nucleotide-polymorphism arrays, we mapped the disease-associated gene to 8.8 Mb on chromosome 19p13. Further analysis using microsatallite markers narrowed the locus to a 3.4-Mb region harboring 120 genes. Of these genes, 30 candidates were sequenced, which identified a single homozygous mutation in PIP5K1C. PIP5K1C encodes phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, type I, gamma (PIPKI gamma ), an enzyme that phophorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). We demonstrate that the mutation causes substitution of aspartic acid with asparagine at amino acid 253 (D253N), abrogating the kinase activity of PIPKI gamma . Thus, a defect in the phosphatidylinositol pathway leading to a decrease in synthesis of PIP(2), a molecule active in endocytosis of synaptic vesicle proteins, culminates in lethal congenital arthrogryposis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
11815424,Metavinculin mutations alter actin interaction in dilated cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Vinculin and its isoform metavinculin are protein components of intercalated discs, structures that anchor thin filaments and transmit contractile force between cardiac myocytes. We tested the hypothesis that heritable dysfunction of metavinculin may contribute to the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed mutational analyses of the metavinculin-specific exon of vinculin in 350 unrelated patients with DCM. One missense mutation (Arg975Trp) and one 3-bp deletion (Leu954del) were identified. These mutations involved conserved amino acids, were absent in 500 control individuals, and significantly altered metavinculin-mediated cross-linking of actin filaments in an in vitro assay. Ultrastructural examination was performed in one patient (Arg975Trp), revealing grossly abnormal intercalated discs. A potential risk-conferring polymorphism (Ala934Val), identified in one DCM patient and one control individual, had a less pronounced effect on actin filament cross-linking. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide genetic and functional evidence for vinculin as a DCM gene and suggest that metavinculin plays a critical role in cardiac structure and function. Disruption of force transmission at the thin filament-intercalated disc interface is the likely mechanism by which mutations in metavinculin may lead to DCM.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18794526,A catechol-O-methyltransferase that is essential for auditory function in mice and humans.,"We have identified a previously unannotated catechol-O-methyltranferase (COMT), here designated COMT2, through positional cloning of a chemically induced mutation responsible for a neurobehavioral phenotype. Mice homozygous for a missense mutation in Comt2 show vestibular impairment, profound sensorineuronal deafness, and progressive degeneration of the organ of Corti. Consistent with this phenotype, COMT2 is highly expressed in sensory hair cells of the inner ear. COMT2 enzymatic activity is significantly reduced by the missense mutation, suggesting that a defect in catecholamine catabolism underlies the auditory and vestibular phenotypes. Based on the studies in mice, we have screened DNA from human families and identified a nonsense mutation in the human ortholog of the murine Comt2 gene that causes nonsyndromic deafness. Defects in catecholamine modification by COMT have been previously implicated in the development of schizophrenia. Our studies identify a previously undescribed COMT gene and indicate an unexpected role for catecholamines in the function of auditory and vestibular sense organs.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

We performed an association scan of >500,000 SNPs in 280 individuals with gallstones and 360 controls. A follow-up study of the 235 most significant SNPs in 1,105 affected individuals and 873 controls replicated the disease association of SNP A-1791411 in ABCG8 (allelic P value P(CCA) = 4.1 x 10(-9)), which was subsequently attributed to coding variant rs11887534 (D19H). Additional replication was achieved in 728 German (P = 2.8 x 10(-7)) and 167 Chilean subjects (P = 0.02). The overall odds ratio for D19H carriership was 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.8-2.6, P = 1.4 x 10(-14)) in the full German sample. Association was stronger in subjects with cholesterol gallstones (odds ratio = 3.3), suggesting that His19 might be associated with a more efficient transport of cholesterol into the bile.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15368194,Identification of a KCNE2 gain-of-function mutation in patients with familial atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. We first reported an S140G mutation of KCNQ1, an alpha subunit of potassium channels, in one Chinese kindred with AF. However, the molecular defects and cellular mechanisms in most patients with AF remain to be identified. We evaluated 28 unrelated Chinese kindreds with AF and sequenced eight genes of potassium channels (KCNQ1, HERG, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNE3, KCNE4, KCNE5, and KCNJ2). An arginine-to-cysteine mutation at position 27 (R27C) of KCNE2, the beta subunit of the KCNQ1-KCNE2 channel responsible for a background potassium current, was found in 2 of the 28 probands. The mutation was present in all affected members in the two kindreds and was absent in 462 healthy unrelated Chinese subjects. Similar to KCNQ1 S140G, the mutation had a gain-of-function effect on the KCNQ1-KCNE2 channel; unlike long QT syndrome-associated KCNE2 mutations, it did not alter HERG-KCNE2 current. The mutation did not alter the functions of the HCN channel family either. Thus, KCNE2 R27C is a gain-of-function mutation associated with the initiation and/or maintenance of AF.",review-article; review; journal article
17603472,Variants conferring risk of atrial fibrillation on chromosome 4q25.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in humans and is characterized by chaotic electrical activity of the atria. It affects one in ten individuals over the age of 80 years, causes significant morbidity and is an independent predictor of mortality. Recent studies have provided evidence of a genetic contribution to AF. Mutations in potassium-channel genes have been associated with familial AF but account for only a small fraction of all cases of AF. We have performed a genome-wide association scan, followed by replication studies in three populations of European descent and a Chinese population from Hong Kong and find a strong association between two sequence variants on chromosome 4q25 and AF. Here we show that about 35% of individuals of European descent have at least one of the variants and that the risk of AF increases by 1.72 and 1.39 per copy. The association with the stronger variant is replicated in the Chinese population, where it is carried by 75% of individuals and the risk of AF is increased by 1.42 per copy. A stronger association was observed in individuals with typical atrial flutter. Both variants are adjacent to PITX2, which is known to have a critical function in left-right asymmetry of the heart.",research-article; journal article
17404618,Involvement of PLEKHM1 in osteoclastic vesicular transport and osteopetrosis in incisors absent rats and humans.,"This study illustrates that Plekhm1 is an essential protein for bone resorption, as loss-of-function mutations were found to underlie the osteopetrotic phenotype of the incisors absent rat as well as an intermediate type of human osteopetrosis. Electron and confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that monocytes from a patient homozygous for the mutation differentiated into osteoclasts normally, but when cultured on dentine discs, the osteoclasts failed to form ruffled borders and showed little evidence of bone resorption. The presence of both RUN and pleckstrin homology domains suggests that Plekhm1 may be linked to small GTPase signaling. We found that Plekhm1 colocalized with Rab7 to late endosomal/lysosomal vesicles in HEK293 and osteoclast-like cells, an effect that was dependent on the prenylation of Rab7. In conclusion, we believe PLEKHM1 to be a novel gene implicated in the development of osteopetrosis, with a putative critical function in vesicular transport in the osteoclast.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17618285,Loss of GLIS2 causes nephronophthisis in humans and mice by increased apoptosis and fibrosis.,"Nephronophthisis (NPHP), an autosomal recessive kidney disease, is the most frequent genetic cause of end-stage renal failure in the first three decades of life. Positional cloning of the six known NPHP genes has linked its pathogenesis to primary cilia function. Here we identify mutation of GLIS2 as causing an NPHP-like phenotype in humans and mice, using positional cloning and mouse transgenics, respectively. Kidneys of Glis2 mutant mice show severe renal atrophy and fibrosis starting at 8 weeks of age. Differential gene expression studies on Glis2 mutant kidneys demonstrate that genes promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis are upregulated in the absence of Glis2. Thus, we identify Glis2 as a transcription factor mutated in NPHP and demonstrate its essential role for the maintenance of renal tissue architecture through prevention of apoptosis and fibrosis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17088085,Human tyrosine kinase 2 deficiency reveals its requisite roles in multiple cytokine signals involved in innate and acquired immunity.,"Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Janus kinase (Jak) family. Here we identified a homozygous Tyk2 mutation in a patient who had been clinically diagnosed with hyper-IgE syndrome. This patient showed unusual susceptibility to various microorganisms including virus, fungi, and mycobacteria and suffered from atopic dermatitis with elevated serum IgE. The patient's cells displayed defects in multiple cytokine signaling pathways including those for type I interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-23. The cytokine signals were successfully restored by transducing the intact Tyk2 gene. Thus, the Tyk2 deficiency is likely to account for the patient's complex clinical manifestations, including the phenotype of impaired T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and accelerated Th2 differentiation. This study identifies human Tyk2 deficiency and demonstrates that Tyk2 plays obligatory roles in multiple cytokine signals involved in innate and acquired immunity of humans, which differs substantially from Tyk2 function in mice.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

Mutations of PTPN11, KRAS and SOS1 in the RAS-MAPK pathway cause approximately 60% of cases of Noonan syndrome. However, the gene(s) responsible for the remainder are unknown. We have identified five different mutations in RAF1 in ten individuals with Noonan syndrome; those with any of four mutations causing changes in the CR2 domain of RAF1 had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), whereas affected individuals with mutations leading to changes in the CR3 domain did not. Cells transfected with constructs containing Noonan syndrome-associated RAF1 mutations showed increased in vitro kinase and ERK activation, and zebrafish embryos with morpholino knockdown of raf1 demonstrated the need for raf1 for the development of normal myocardial structure and function. Thus, our findings implicate RAF1 gain-of-function mutations as a causative agent of a human developmental disorder, representing a new genetic mechanism for the activation of the MAPK pathway.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17603483,Gain-of-function RAF1 mutations cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes are developmental disorders with overlapping features, including cardiac abnormalities, short stature and facial dysmorphia. Increased RAS signaling owing to PTPN11, SOS1 and KRAS mutations causes approximately 60% of Noonan syndrome cases, and PTPN11 mutations cause 90% of LEOPARD syndrome cases. Here, we report that 18 of 231 individuals with Noonan syndrome without known mutations (corresponding to 3% of all affected individuals) and two of six individuals with LEOPARD syndrome without PTPN11 mutations have missense mutations in RAF1, which encodes a serine-threonine kinase that activates MEK1 and MEK2. Most mutations altered a motif flanking Ser259, a residue critical for autoinhibition of RAF1 through 14-3-3 binding. Of 19 subjects with a RAF1 mutation in two hotspots, 18 (or 95%) showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), compared with the 18% prevalence of HCM among individuals with Noonan syndrome in general. Ectopically expressed RAF1 mutants from the two HCM hotspots had increased kinase activity and enhanced ERK activation, whereas non-HCM-associated mutants were kinase impaired. Our findings further implicate increased RAS signaling in pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

16168495,Monogenic nonsyndromic otosclerosis: audiological and linkage analysis in a large Greek pedigree.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to characterize the hearing impairment in a large multigenerational Greek family with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic otosclerosis and to perform genetic linkage analysis to known otosclerosis loci and collagen genes. In addition, we looked for mutations in the NOG gene to rule out congenital stapes ankylosis syndrome. METHODS: Audiological analysis of the affected persons was based on multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis and construction of age-related typical audiograms (ARTA). Genotyping of microsatellite DNA polymorphisms for known otosclerosis (OTSC) loci or collagen genes and linkage analysis using the MLINK computer program were performed. The coding region of the NOG gene was screened for mutations by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The hearing loss in this family appears in childhood as conductive, but soon becomes mixed. Because the additional sensorineural component is progressive, this finally has lead to a pure sensorineural hearing loss in some family members, as the conductive component is masked. Audiological analysis showed an age-independent conductive component and a progressive frequency-specific sensorineural component. Linkage analysis excluded linkage to the four known otosclerosis loci (OTSC1, OTSC2, OTSC3, and OTSC5), as well as to the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes. Mutation analysis of the coding region of the NOG gene did not reveal any disease causing mutation. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first description of a detailed audiological analysis in a large pedigree segregating otosclerosis as a monogenic autosomal dominant trait. Exclusion of the four known otosclerosis loci in this family shows that monogenic otosclerosis is a genetically heterogeneous disease involving at least five different genes.

The SLC4A1 mutations causing AD dRTA were reported in white patients, whereas those associated with AR dRTA were often found in Southeast Asia. Here, the authors report additional novel SLC4A1 mutations in 3 patients with AR dRTA from 2 unrelated Thai families. METHODS:The patients and members of their families were clinically studied. Red cell morphology and sulfate influx were examined. The SLC4A1 gene was screened, analyzed, and confirmed for mutations by molecular genetic techniques. RESULTS:In the first family, the patient had dRTA, rickets, failure to thrive, nephrocalcinosis, and hypokalemic-hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with a urine pH level of 7.00. He had novel compound heterozygous SLC4A1 G701D/S773P mutations, inherited from clinically normal heterozygous mother and father. In the second family, the patient and his sister had dRTA and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) with different clinical severity. The patient had proximal muscle weakness, rickets, nephrocalcinosis, hypokalemia, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, and urine pH level of 6.80. His sister was asymptomatic but the urine pH level could not be lowered to below 5.50 after a short acid load. Both siblings had compound heterozygous SLC4A1 SAO/R602H mutations. CONCLUSION:Two novel compound heterozygous SLC4A1 G701D/S773P and SAO/R602H mutations were identified in Thai patients with AR dRTA.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
10739768,Autosomal-dominant congenital cataract associated with a deletion mutation in the human beaded filament protein gene BFSP2.,"Congenital cataracts are a common major abnormality of the eye that frequently cause blindness in infants. At least one-third of all cases are familial; autosomal-dominant congenital cataract appears to be the most-common familial form in the Western world. Elsewhere, in family ADCC-3, we mapped an autosomal-dominant cataract gene to chromosome 3q21-q22, near the gene that encodes a lens-specific beaded filament protein gene, BFSP2. By sequencing the coding regions of BFSP2, we found that a deletion mutation, DeltaE233, is associated with cataracts in this family. This is the first report of an inherited cataract that is caused by a mutation in a cytoskeletal protein.",research-article; review; journal article
17671655,Impaired basolateral sorting of pro-EGF causes isolated recessive renal hypomagnesemia.,"Primary hypomagnesemia constitutes a rare heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by renal or intestinal magnesium (Mg(2+)) wasting resulting in generally shared symptoms of Mg(2+) depletion, such as tetany and generalized convulsions, and often including associated disturbances in calcium excretion. However, most of the genes involved in the physiology of Mg(2+) handling are unknown. Through the discovery of a mutation in the EGF gene in isolated autosomal recessive renal hypomagnesemia, we have, for what we believe is the first time, identified a magnesiotropic hormone crucial for total body Mg(2+) balance. The mutation leads to impaired basolateral sorting of pro-EGF. As a consequence, the renal EGFR is inadequately stimulated, resulting in insufficient activation of the epithelial Mg(2+) channel TRPM6 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 6) and thereby Mg(2+) loss. Furthermore, we show that colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab, an antagonist of the EGFR, develop hypomagnesemia, emphasizing the significance of EGF in maintaining Mg(2+) balance.","clinical trial; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
16909394,Mutations in the CEP290 (NPHP6) gene are a frequent cause of Leber congenital amaurosis.,"Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is one of the main causes of childhood blindness. To date, mutations in eight genes have been described, which together account for approximately 45% of LCA cases. We localized the genetic defect in a consanguineous LCA-affected family from Quebec and identified a splice defect in a gene encoding a centrosomal protein (CEP290). The defect is caused by an intronic mutation (c.2991+1655A-->G) that creates a strong splice-donor site and inserts a cryptic exon in the CEP290 messenger RNA. This mutation was detected in 16 (21%) of 76 unrelated patients with LCA, either homozygously or in combination with a second deleterious mutation on the other allele. CEP290 mutations therefore represent one of the most frequent causes of LCA identified so far.",research-article; journal article
17898177,Hypomorphic CEP290/NPHP6 mutations result in anosmia caused by the selective loss of G proteins in cilia of olfactory sensory neurons.,"Cilia regulate diverse functions such as motility, fluid balance, and sensory perception. The cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) compartmentalize the signaling proteins necessary for odor detection; however, little is known regarding the mechanisms of protein sorting/entry into olfactory cilia. Nephrocystins are a family of ciliary proteins likely involved in cargo sorting during transport from the basal body to the ciliary axoneme. In humans, loss-of-function of the cilia-centrosomal protein CEP290/NPHP6 is associated with Joubert and Meckel syndromes, whereas hypomorphic mutations result in Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a form of early-onset retinal dystrophy. Here, we report that CEP290-LCA patients exhibit severely abnormal olfactory function. In a mouse model with hypomorphic mutations in CEP290 [retinal dystrophy-16 mice (rd16)], electro-olfactogram recordings revealed an anosmic phenotype analogous to that of CEP290-LCA patients. Despite the loss of olfactory function, cilia of OSNs remained intact in the rd16 mice. As in wild type, CEP290 localized to dendritic knobs of rd16 OSNs, where it was in complex with ciliary transport proteins and the olfactory G proteins G(olf) and Ggamma(13). Interestingly, we observed defective ciliary localization of G(olf) and Ggamma(13) but not of G protein-coupled odorant receptors or other components of the odorant signaling pathway in the rd16 OSNs. Our data implicate distinct mechanisms for ciliary transport of olfactory signaling proteins, with CEP290 being a key mediator involved in G protein trafficking. The assessment of olfactory function can, therefore, serve as a useful diagnostic tool for genetic screening of certain syndromic ciliary diseases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18230725,Mutations in NALP12 cause hereditary periodic fever syndromes.,"NALP proteins, also known as NLRPs, belong to the CATERPILLER protein family involved, like Toll-like receptors, in the recognition of microbial molecules and the subsequent activation of inflammatory and immune responses. Current advances in the function of NALPs support the recently proposed model of a disease continuum bridging autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Among these diseases, hereditary periodic fevers (HPFs) are Mendelian disorders associated with sequence variations in very few genes; these variations are mostly missense mutations whose deleterious effect, which is particularly difficult to assess, is often questionable. The growing number of identified sporadic cases of periodic fever syndrome, together with the lack of discriminatory clinical criteria, has greatly hampered the identification of new disease-causing genes, a step that is, however, essential for appropriate management of these disorders. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified nonambiguous mutations in NALP12 (i.e., nonsense and splice site) in two families with periodic fever syndromes. As shown by means of functional studies, these two NALP12 mutations have a deleterious effect on NF-kappaB signaling. Overall, these data identify a group of HPFs defined by molecular defects in NALP12, opening up new ways to manage these disorders. The identification of these first NALP12 mutations in patients with autoinflammatory disorder also clearly demonstrates the crucial role of NALP12 in inflammatory signaling pathways, thereby assigning a precise function to this particular member of an emerging family of proteins whose putative biological properties are currently inferred essentially through in vitro means.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
10432380,"A novel apolipoprotein E mutation, E2 (Arg25Cys), in lipoprotein glomerulopathy.","BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is characterized by intraglomerular lipoprotein thrombosis and high plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo) E. An apo E variant, apo E2 (Arg145Pro) Sendai, was recently identified in three patients with LPG. We detected a novel point mutation in the apo E gene in a patient with LPG, and we characterized the mutant apo E. METHODS: The propositus was a 32-year-old male patient on maintenance hemodialysis because of LPG. The mutation was detected by sequencing of genomic DNA from the patient and was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with Aor51HI. Recombinant apo E2 (Arg25Cys) Kyoto and normal apo E3 were expressed from COS-1 cells. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-binding activities of the variants were determined in an in vitro competition assay. RESULTS: The propositus had the apo E phenotype E2/E4, as determined by isoelectric focusing, and the genotype epsilon3/epsilon4, as determined by RFLP with HhaI. Sequence analysis of amplified DNA showed a C to T transition, changing the codon for residue 25 from arginine to cysteine. The proband was a heterozygous carrier for apo E2 (Arg25Cys) Kyoto. A family study showed that the mother was a heterozygous carrier of apo E2 Kyoto and had dysbetalipoproteinemia, but no LPG. The pathophysiological effect of this mutation was investigated in vitro by binding studies of recombinant apo E2 Kyoto to LDL receptors on human fibroblasts. The ability of recombinant apo E2 Kyoto to displace LDL was reduced to 10% compared with recombinant apo E3. CONCLUSIONS: Apo E2 (Arg25Cys) Kyoto is a novel mutation of apo E that is etiologically related to LPG. However, our case indicates that the development of LPG may involve other genetic or environmental factors. Furthermore, our data suggest that arginine-25 of apo E plays an important functional role by influencing the receptor-binding ability of apo E.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17967977,Mutation in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 like gene (GPD1-L) decreases cardiac Na+ current and causes inherited arrhythmias.,"Brugada syndrome is a rare, autosomal-dominant, male-predominant form of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation characterized by a right bundle-branch block and ST elevation in the right precordial leads of the surface ECG. Mutations in the cardiac Na+ channel SCN5A on chromosome 3p21 cause approximately 20% of the cases of Brugada syndrome; most mutations decrease inward Na+ current, some by preventing trafficking of the channels to the surface membrane. We previously used positional cloning to identify a new locus on chromosome 3p24 in a large family with Brugada syndrome and excluded SCN5A as a candidate gene.We used direct sequencing to identify a mutation (A280V) in a conserved amino acid of the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like (GPD1-L) gene. The mutation was present in all affected individuals and absent in >500 control subjects. GPD1-L RNA and protein are abundant in the heart. Compared with wild-type GPD1-L, coexpression of A280V GPD1-L with SCN5A in HEK cells reduced inward Na+ currents by approximately 50% (P<0.005). Wild-type GPD1-L localized near the cell surface to a greater extent than A280V GPD1-L. Coexpression of A280V GPD1-L with SCN5A reduced SCN5A cell surface expression by 31+/-5% (P=0.01).GPD1-L is a novel gene that may affect trafficking of the cardiac Na+ channel to the cell surface. A GPD1-L mutation decreases SCN5A surface membrane expression, reduces inward Na+ current, and causes Brugada syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
11839626,Clinical and molecular heterogeneity in the Brugada syndrome: a novel gene locus on chromosome 3.,"BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome is a form of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation characterized by a right bundle-branch block pattern and ST elevation (STE) in the right precordial leads of the ECG. Sodium channel blockers increase STE. Mutations of the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A cause the disorder, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is often recommended for affected individuals. Mutations in other genes have not been identified, and it is not known if the efficacy of drug testing or the malignancy of arrhythmias correlates to the gene defect. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed histories, physical examinations, ECGs, and drug testing on a large multigenerational family with Brugada syndrome. DNA isolated from blood samples, polymorphic genomic markers, and polymorphisms within candidate sodium channels were used for a genome-wide screen, fine mapping, and linkage analysis. We identified 12 affected individuals (right bundle-branch block, > or =1-mm STE) with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern characterized by incomplete penetrance that appeared to be dependent on age and sex. Four affected individuals had syncope and 2 had documented ventricular arrhythmias, but there was minimal family history of sudden death. Procainamide infusions did not identify additional affected individuals. Linkage was present to an approximately equal 15-cM region on chromosome 3p22-25 (maximum LOD score=4.00). The sodium channel genes SCN5A, SCN10A, and SCN12A on chromosome 3 were excluded as candidates (LOD scores < or =-2). CONCLUSIONS: A Brugada syndrome locus distinct from SCN5A is associated with progressive conduction disease, a low sensitivity to procainamide testing, and a relatively good prognosis in a single large pedigree.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

HIF-alpha is a transcription factor that modulates a wide range of processes, including erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and cellular metabolism. We describe a family with erythrocytosis and a mutation in the HIF2A gene, which encodes the HIF-2alpha protein. Our functional studies indicate that this mutation leads to stabilization of the HIF-2alpha protein and suggest that wild-type HIF-2alpha regulates erythropoietin production in adults.","research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19409525,"Mutations in smooth muscle alpha-actin (ACTA2) cause coronary artery disease, stroke, and Moyamoya disease, along with thoracic aortic disease.","The vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific isoform of alpha-actin (ACTA2) is a major component of the contractile apparatus in SMCs located throughout the arterial system. Heterozygous ACTA2 mutations cause familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD), but only half of mutation carriers have aortic disease. Linkage analysis and association studies of individuals in 20 families with ACTA2 mutations indicate that mutation carriers can have a diversity of vascular diseases, including premature onset of coronary artery disease (CAD) and premature ischemic strokes (including Moyamoya disease [MMD]), as well as previously defined TAAD. Sequencing of DNA from patients with nonfamilial TAAD and from premature-onset CAD patients independently identified ACTA2 mutations in these patients and premature onset strokes in family members with ACTA2 mutations. Vascular pathology and analysis of explanted SMCs and myofibroblasts from patients harboring ACTA2 suggested that increased proliferation of SMCs contributed to occlusive diseases. These results indicate that heterozygous ACTA2 mutations predispose patients to a variety of diffuse and diverse vascular diseases, including TAAD, premature CAD, ischemic strokes, and MMD. These data demonstrate that diffuse vascular diseases resulting from either occluded or enlarged arteries can be caused by mutations in a single gene and have direct implications for clinical management and research on familial vascular diseases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
3058231,A molecular study of heterozygous protein 4.1 deficiency in hereditary elliptocytosis.,"Genomic DNA from five kindreds and two individuals with hereditary elliptocytosis [HE(4.1+)] and a partial deficiency of protein 4.1 [HE(4.1+)] was extracted and probed with a cDNA for protein 4.1. When using a fragment of the cDNA that encompassed the coding region of the gene, two restriction fragment length polymorphisms segregating with protein 4.1 deficiency were found in one kindred when using the enzymes BgIII and PvuII but were not seen in the other HE(4.1+) subjects or in 20 random control individuals. DNA digested with three other enzymes (HindIII, EcoRI, TaqI) produced restriction patterns similar to controls. The unique BgIII and PvuII polymorphisms probably reflect a rearrangement of the coding region of the protein 4.1 gene as the underlying cause of the partial protein 4.1 deficiency in this family. A less likely possibility is that these polymorphisms represent coincidental single base changes unrelated to the primary gene defect.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18179881,Biallelic mutation of BEST1 causes a distinct retinopathy in humans.,"We describe a distinct retinal disorder, autosomal-recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB), that is consequent upon biallelic mutation in BEST1 and is associated with central visual loss, a characteristic retinopathy, an absent electro-oculogram light rise, and a reduced electroretinogram. Heterozygous mutations in BEST1 have previously been found to cause the two dominantly inherited disorders, Best macular dystrophy and autosomal-dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy. The transmembrane protein bestrophin-1, encoded by BEST1, is located at the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium in which it probably functions as a Cl(-) channel. We sequenced BEST1 in five families, identifying DNA variants in each of ten alleles. These encoded six different missense variants and one nonsense variant. The alleles segregated appropriately for a recessive disorder in each family. No clinical or electrophysiological abnormalities were identified in any heterozygotes. We conducted whole-cell patch-clamping of HEK293 cells transfected with bestrophin-1 to measure the Cl(-) current. Two ARB missense isoforms severely reduced channel activity. However, unlike two other alleles previously associated with Best disease, cotransfection with wild-type bestrophin-1 did not impair the formation of active wild-type bestrophin-1 channels, consistent with the recessive nature of the condition. We propose that ARB is the null phenotype of bestrophin-1 in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
17060380,Mutant caveolin-3 induces persistent late sodium current and is associated with long-QT syndrome.,"BACKGROUND:Congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is a primary arrhythmogenic syndrome stemming from perturbed cardiac repolarization. LQTS, which affects approximately 1 in 3000 persons, is 1 of the most common causes of autopsy-negative sudden death in the young. Since the sentinel discovery of cardiac channel gene mutations in LQTS in 1995, hundreds of mutations in 8 LQTS susceptibility genes have been identified. All 8 LQTS genotypes represent primary cardiac channel defects (ie, ion channelopathy) except LQT4, which is a functional channelopathy because of mutations in ankyrin-B. Approximately 25% of LQTS remains unexplained pathogenetically. We have pursued a ""final common pathway"" hypothesis to elicit novel LQTS-susceptibility genes. With the recent observation that the LQT3-associated, SCN5A-encoded cardiac sodium channel localizes in caveolae, which are known membrane microdomains whose major component in the striated muscle is caveolin-3, we hypothesized that mutations in caveolin-3 may represent a novel pathogenetic mechanism for LQTS. METHODS AND RESULTS:Using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and direct DNA sequencing, we performed open reading frame/splice site mutational analysis on CAV3 in 905 unrelated patients referred for LQTS genetic testing. CAV3 mutations were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis and the molecular phenotype determined by transient heterologous expression into cell lines that stably express the cardiac sodium channel hNa(v)1.5. We identified 4 novel mutations in CAV3-encoded caveolin-3 that were absent in >1000 control alleles. Electrophysiological analysis of sodium current in HEK293 cells stably expressing hNa(v)1.5 and transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant caveolin-3 demonstrated that mutant caveolin-3 results in a 2- to 3-fold increase in late sodium current compared with wild-type caveolin-3. Our observations are similar to the increased late sodium current associated with LQT3-associated SCN5A mutations. CONCLUSIONS:The present study reports the first CAV3 mutations in subjects with LQTS, and we provide functional data demonstrating a gain-of-function increase in late sodium current.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17592081,SCN4B-encoded sodium channel beta4 subunit in congenital long-QT syndrome.,"Congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is potentially lethal secondary to malignant ventricular arrhythmias and is caused predominantly by mutations in genes that encode cardiac ion channels. Nearly 25% of patients remain without a genetic diagnosis, and genes that encode cardiac channel regulatory proteins represent attractive candidates. Voltage-gated sodium channels have a pore-forming alpha-subunit associated with 1 or more auxiliary beta-subunits. Four different beta-subunits have been described. All are detectable in cardiac tissue, but none have yet been linked to any heritable arrhythmia syndrome.We present a case of a 21-month-old Mexican-mestizo female with intermittent 2:1 atrioventricular block and a corrected QT interval of 712 ms. Comprehensive open reading frame/splice mutational analysis of the 9 established LQTS-susceptibility genes proved negative, and complete mutational analysis of the 4 Na(vbeta)-subunits revealed a L179F (C535T) missense mutation in SCN4B that cosegregated properly throughout a 3-generation pedigree and was absent in 800 reference alleles. After this discovery, SCN4B was analyzed in 262 genotype-negative LQTS patients (96% white), but no further mutations were found. L179F was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells that contained the stably expressed SCN5A-encoded sodium channel alpha-subunit (hNa(V)1.5). Compared with the wild-type, L179F-beta4 caused an 8-fold (compared with SCN5A alone) and 3-fold (compared with SCN5A + WT-beta4) increase in late sodium current consistent with the molecular/electrophysiological phenotype previously shown for LQTS-associated mutations.We provide the seminal report of SCN4B-encoded Na(vbeta)4 as a novel LQT3-susceptibility gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18179902,22q11.2 distal deletion: a recurrent genomic disorder distinct from DiGeorge syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome.,"Microdeletions within chromosome 22q11.2 cause a variable phenotype, including DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). About 97% of patients with DGS/VCFS have either a common recurrent approximately 3 Mb deletion or a smaller, less common, approximately 1.5 Mb nested deletion. Both deletions apparently occur as a result of homologous recombination between nonallelic flanking low-copy repeat (LCR) sequences located in 22q11.2. Interestingly, although eight different LCRs are located in proximal 22q, only a few cases of atypical deletions utilizing alternative LCRs have been described. Using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis, we have detected six unrelated cases of deletions that are within 22q11.2 and are located distal to the approximately 3 Mb common deletion region. Further analyses revealed that the rearrangements had clustered breakpoints and either a approximately 1.4 Mb or approximately 2.1 Mb recurrent deletion flanked proximally by LCR22-4 and distally by either LCR22-5 or LCR22-6, respectively. Parental fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that none of the available parents (11 out of 12 were available) had the deletion, indicating de novo events. All patients presented with characteristic facial dysmorphic features. A history of prematurity, prenatal and postnatal growth delay, developmental delay, and mild skeletal abnormalities was prevalent among the patients. Two patients were found to have a cardiovascular malformation, one had truncus arteriosus, and another had a bicuspid aortic valve. A single patient had a cleft palate. We conclude that distal deletions of chromosome 22q11.2 between LCR22-4 and LCR22-6, although they share some characteristic features with DGS/VCFS, represent a novel genomic disorder distinct genomically and clinically from the well-known DGS/VCF deletion syndromes.",brief-report; journal article
17224476,"Loss-of-function mutations in the cardiac calcium channel underlie a new clinical entity characterized by ST-segment elevation, short QT intervals, and sudden cardiac death.","Cardiac ion channelopathies are responsible for an ever-increasing number and diversity of familial cardiac arrhythmia syndromes. We describe a new clinical entity that consists of an ST-segment elevation in the right precordial ECG leads, a shorter-than-normal QT interval, and a history of sudden cardiac death.Eighty-two consecutive probands with Brugada syndrome were screened for ion channel gene mutations with direct sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed, and CHO-K1 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant CACNB2b (Ca(v beta2b)), CACNA2D1 (Ca(v alpha2delta1)), and CACNA1C tagged with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (Ca(v)1.2). Whole-cell patch-clamp studies were performed after 48 to 72 hours. Three probands displaying ST-segment elevation and corrected QT intervals < or = 360 ms had mutations in genes encoding the cardiac L-type calcium channel. Corrected QT ranged from 330 to 370 ms among probands and clinically affected family members. Rate adaptation of QT interval was reduced. Quinidine normalized the QT interval and prevented stimulation-induced ventricular tachycardia. Genetic and heterologous expression studies revealed loss-of-function missense mutations in CACNA1C (A39V and G490R) and CACNB2 (S481L) encoding the alpha1- and beta2b-subunits of the L-type calcium channel. Confocal microscopy revealed a defect in trafficking of A39V Ca(v)1.2 channels but normal trafficking of channels containing G490R Ca(v)1.2 or S481L Ca(v beta2b)-subunits.This is the first report of loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding the cardiac L-type calcium channel to be associated with a familial sudden cardiac death syndrome in which a Brugada syndrome phenotype is combined with shorter-than-normal QT intervals.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
15542288,Severe disease expression of cardiac troponin C and T mutations in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.,"OBJECTIVES: We performed genetic investigations of cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) and troponin C (TNNC1) in 235 consecutive patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) to evaluate prevalence of mutations and associated disease expression in affected families. BACKGROUND: Recently, mutations in sarcomeric genes have been reported in DCM. However, the prevalence, penetrance, and clinical significance of sarcomere gene mutations in large consecutive cohorts of DCM patients are poorly defined. METHODS: Mutation detection was performed by fluorescent SSCP/DHPLC analysis and direct sequencing. The functional effects of mutations on interactions within the troponin complex were assessed by a two-hybrid luciferase assay. RESULTS: A total of 43% (102 of 235) of the study cohort had familial DCM. One TNNC1 and four TNNT2 (three novel) mutations were identified in one and four families, respectively. The prevalence of TNNC1/TNNT2 mutations in familial DCM was 5% with a penetrance of 100%. A total of 21 mutation carriers were identified; 6 underwent cardiac transplantation, 5 died of heart failure, and 4 died suddenly at a mean age of 29 years, while 6 remained stable on medication. Functional studies showed significant impairment of mutated troponin interaction compared with wild-type control, indicating an altered regulation of myocardial contractility. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac troponin C was identified as a novel DCM gene. The disease expression associated with TNNC1 and TNNT2 mutations was severe with complete penetrance. The data suggest that mutation analysis of the troponin complex in DCM patients may prove valuable in early identification of individuals with an adverse prognosis and a high risk of premature death. This may lead to improved management and survival.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17886298,Angiogenin loss-of-function mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Heterozygous missense mutations in the coding region of angiogenin (ANG), an angiogenic ribonuclease, have been reported in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. However, the role of ANG in motor neuron physiology and the functional consequences of these mutations are unknown. We searched for new mutations and sought to define the functional consequences of these mutations.We sequenced the coding region of ANG in an independent cohort of North American ALS patients. Identified ANG mutations were then characterized using functional assays of angiogenesis, ribonucleolysis, and nuclear translocation. We also examined expression of ANG in normal human fetal and adult spinal cords.We identified four mutations in the coding region of ANG from 298 ALS patients. Three of these mutations are present in the mature protein. Among the four mutations, P(-4)S, S28N, and P112L are novel, and K17I has been reported previously. Functional assays show that these ANG mutations result in complete loss of function. The mutant ANG proteins are unable to induce angiogenesis because of a deficiency in ribonuclease activity, nuclear translocation, or both. As a correlate, we demonstrate strong ANG expression in both endothelial cells and motor neurons of normal human spinal cords from the developing fetus and adult.We provide the first evidence that ANG mutations, identified in ALS patients, are associated with functional loss of ANG activity. Moreover, strong ANG expression, in normal human fetal and adult spinal cord neurons and endothelial cells, confirms the plausibility of ANG dysfunction being relevant to the pathogenesis of ALS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

Detailed molecular and phenotypic characterisations were performed on 17 deletion subjects and ten subjects with the duplication.The most common clinical manifestations in 17 deletion and 10 duplication subjects were speech/language delay and cognitive impairment. Other phenotypes in the deletion patients included motor delay (50%), seizures ( approximately 40%), behavioural problems ( approximately 40%), congenital anomalies ( approximately 30%), and autism ( approximately 20%). The phenotypes among duplication patients included motor delay (6/10), behavioural problems (especially attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) (6/10), congenital anomalies (5/10), and seizures (3/10). Patients with the 16p11.2 deletion had statistically significant macrocephaly (p<0.0017) and 6 of the 10 patients with the duplication had microcephaly. One subject with the deletion was asymptomatic and another with the duplication had a normal cognitive and behavioural phenotype. Genomic analyses revealed additional complexity to the 16p11.2 region with mechanistic implications. The chromosomal rearrangement was de novo in all but 2 of the 10 deletion cases in which parental studies were available. Additionally, 2 de novo cases were apparently mosaic for the deletion in the analysed blood sample. Three de novo and 2 inherited cases were observed in the 5 of 10 duplication patients where data were available.Recurrent reciprocal 16p11.2 deletion and duplication are characterised by a spectrum of primarily neurocognitive phenotypes that are subject to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.

Utilizing high-resolution chromosome analysis, array CGH and SNP technologies we identified a novel genomic syndrome comprising of an interstitial duplication of approximately 1.61 Mb at the distal end of chromosome 3 band q29. The imbalance was present in five individuals in a three generation family with clinical features including mild to moderate mental retardation and microcephaly. The duplicated segment overlaps with and is the genomic counterpart of the recently described microdeletion of 3q29. Both syndromes are proposed to occur by non-allelic homologous recombination between regions of low copy repeats present around the breakpoints.",journal article; case reports
19203578,The RIDDLE syndrome protein mediates a ubiquitin-dependent signaling cascade at sites of DNA damage.,"The biological response to DNA double-strand breaks acts to preserve genome integrity. Individuals bearing inactivating mutations in components of this response exhibit clinical symptoms that include cellular radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. The archetype for such disorders is Ataxia-Telangiectasia caused by biallelic mutation in ATM, a central component of the DNA damage response. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is mutated in the RIDDLE syndrome, a recently discovered immunodeficiency and radiosensitivity disorder. We show that RNF168 is recruited to sites of DNA damage by binding to ubiquitylated histone H2A. RNF168 acts with UBC13 to amplify the RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitylation by targeting H2A-type histones and by promoting the formation of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates. These RNF168-dependent chromatin modifications orchestrate the accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to DNA lesions, and their loss is the likely cause of the cellular and developmental phenotypes associated with RIDDLE syndrome.",research-article; journal article
17940005,RIDDLE immunodeficiency syndrome is linked to defects in 53BP1-mediated DNA damage signaling.,"Cellular DNA double-strand break-repair pathways have evolved to protect the integrity of the genome from a continual barrage of potentially detrimental insults. Inherited mutations in genes that control this process result in an inability to properly repair DNA damage, ultimately leading to developmental defects and also cancer predisposition. Here, we describe a patient with a previously undescribed syndrome, which we have termed RIDDLE syndrome (radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, dysmorphic features and learning difficulties), whose cells lack an ability to recruit 53BP1 to sites of DNA double-strand breaks. As a consequence, cells derived from this patient exhibit a hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, cell cycle checkpoint abnormalities, and impaired end-joining in the recombined switch regions. Sequencing of TP53BP1 and other genes known to regulate ionizing radiation-induced 53BP1 foci formation in this patient failed to detect any mutations. Therefore, these data indicate the existence of a DNA double-strand break-repair protein that functions upstream of 53BP1 and contributes to the normal development of the human immune system.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
19372089,Further delineation of the 15q13 microdeletion and duplication syndromes: a clinical spectrum varying from non-pathogenic to a severe outcome.,"Recurrent 15q13.3 microdeletions were recently identified with identical proximal (BP4) and distal (BP5) breakpoints and associated with mild to moderate mental retardation and epilepsy.To assess further the clinical implications of this novel 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome, 18 new probands with a deletion were molecularly and clinically characterised. In addition, we evaluated the characteristics of a family with a more proximal deletion between BP3 and BP4. Finally, four patients with a duplication in the BP3-BP4-BP5 region were included in this study to ascertain the clinical significance of duplications in this region.The 15q13.3 microdeletion in our series was associated with a highly variable intra- and inter-familial phenotype. At least 11 of the 18 deletions identified were inherited. Moreover, 7 of 10 siblings from four different families also had this deletion: one had a mild developmental delay, four had only learning problems during childhood, but functioned well in daily life as adults, whereas the other two had no learning problems at all. In contrast to previous findings, seizures were not a common feature in our series (only 2 of 17 living probands). Three patients with deletions had cardiac defects and deletion of the KLF13 gene, located in the critical region, may contribute to these abnormalities. The limited data from the single family with the more proximal BP3-BP4 deletion suggest this deletion may have little clinical significance. Patients with duplications of the BP3-BP4-BP5 region did not share a recognisable phenotype, but psychiatric disease was noted in 2 of 4 patients.Overall, our findings broaden the phenotypic spectrum associated with 15q13.3 deletions and suggest that, in some individuals, deletion of 15q13.3 is not sufficient to cause disease. The existence of microdeletion syndromes, associated with an unpredictable and variable phenotypic outcome, will pose the clinician with diagnostic difficulties and challenge the commonly used paradigm in the diagnostic setting that aberrations inherited from a phenotypically normal parent are usually without clinical consequences.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

This deletion likely resulted from nonallelic homologous recombination between low-copy repeats on the normal and inverted region of chromosome 15q13.3. Although this deletion also affects OTUD7A, accumulated data suggest that haploinsufficiency of CHRNA7 is causative for the majority of neurodevelopmental phenotypes in the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18304496,Mutation of solute carrier SLC16A12 associates with a syndrome combining juvenile cataract with microcornea and renal glucosuria.,"Unobstructed vision requires a particular refractive index of the lens, a measure based on the organization of the structural proteins within the differentiated lens cells. To ensure an intact lens structure, homeostasis within the lens cells is indispensable. Alterations of the lens structure result in opacity and lead to cataract. Renal glucosuria is defined by elevated glucose level in the urine without hyperglycemia and without evidence of morphological renal anomalies. In a Swiss family with autosomal dominant juvenile cataract, microcornea, and renal glucosuria, we have identified a nonsense mutation in a member of the carboxylic acid transporter family SLC16. The underlying gene defect in SLC16A12 resides within a 3 cM region on chromosome 10q23.13 defined by linkage mapping of this phenotype. We found tissue-specific variability of SLC16A12 transcript levels in control samples, with high expression in the eye and kidney, the two organs affected by this syndrome. This report demonstrates biological relevance of this solute carrier. We hypothesize that SLC16A12 is important for lens and kidney homeostasis and discuss its potential role in age-related cataract.",research-article; journal article
18313024,Neuropathy target esterase gene mutations cause motor neuron disease.,"The possibility that organophosphorus (OP) compounds contribute to motor neuron disease (MND) is supported by association of paraoxonase 1 polymorphisms with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the occurrence of MND in OP compound-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN), in which neuropathy target esterase (NTE) is inhibited by organophosphorylation. We evaluated a consanguineous kindred and a genetically unrelated nonconsanguineous kindred in which affected subjects exhibited progressive spastic paraplegia and distal muscle wasting. Affected subjects resembled those with OPIDN and those with Troyer Syndrome due to SPG20/spartin gene mutation (excluded by genetic linkage and SPG20/spartin sequence analysis). Genome-wide analysis suggested linkage to a 22 cM homozygous locus (D19S565 to D19S884, maximum multipoint LOD score 3.28) on chromosome 19p13 to which NTE had been mapped (GenBank AJ004832). NTE was a candidate because of its role in OPIDN and the similarity of our patients to those with OPIDN. Affected subjects in the consanguineous kindred were homozygous for disease-specific NTE mutation c.3034A-->G that disrupted an interspecies conserved residue (M1012V) in NTE's catalytic domain. Affected subjects in the nonconsanguineous family were compound heterozygotes: one allele had c.2669G-->A mutation, which disrupts an interspecies conserved residue in NTE's catalytic domain (R890H), and the other allele had an insertion (c.2946_2947insCAGC) causing frameshift and protein truncation (p.S982fs1019). Disease-specific, nonconserved NTE mutations in unrelated MND patients indicates NTE's importance in maintaining axonal integrity, raises the possibility that NTE pathway disturbances contribute to other MNDs including ALS, and supports the role of NTE abnormalities in axonopathy produced by neuropathic OP compounds.",review-article; review; journal article
19026395,Mutations in glucose transporter 9 gene SLC2A9 cause renal hypouricemia.,"Renal hypouricemia is an inherited disorder characterized by impaired renal urate (uric acid) reabsorption and subsequent low serum urate levels, with severe complications such as exercise-induced acute renal failure and nephrolithiasis. We previously identified SLC22A12, also known as URAT1, as a causative gene of renal hypouricemia. However, hypouricemic patients without URAT1 mutations, as well as genome-wide association studies between urate and SLC2A9 (also called GLUT9), imply that GLUT9 could be another causative gene of renal hypouricemia. With a large human database, we identified two loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in GLUT9, which occur in the highly conserved ""sugar transport proteins signatures 1/2."" Both mutations result in loss of positive charges, one of which is reported to be an important membrane topology determinant. The oocyte expression study revealed that both GLUT9 isoforms showed high urate transport activities, whereas the mutated GLUT9 isoforms markedly reduced them. Our findings, together with previous reports on GLUT9 localization, suggest that these GLUT9 mutations cause renal hypouricemia by their decreased urate reabsorption on both sides of the renal proximal tubules. These findings also enable us to propose a physiological model of the renal urate reabsorption in which GLUT9 regulates serum urate levels in humans and can be a promising therapeutic target for gout and related cardiovascular diseases.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15884099,Fusion of the EWSR1 and ATF1 genes without expression of the MITF-M transcript in angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma.,"Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is a rare soft tissue tumor that usually occurs in children and young adults. Only two cases of AFH with genetic rearrangements have been reported previously; both of these had a FUS-ATF1 fusion gene. We have studied an AFH from a 9-year-old boy whose tumor displayed a t(12;22)(q13;q12) as the sole cytogenetic aberration. FISH,RT-PCR, and sequence analyses revealed an EWSR1-ATF1 fusion gene that has previously been reported in clear cell sarcoma (CCS), a soft tissue sarcoma that is morphologically and clinically distinct from AFH. This study thus has demonstrated that the EWSR1-ATF1 chimera represents a fusion gene that can be associated with different tumor types. Simultaneous expression of the EWSR1-ATF1 and MITF-M transcripts in CCS has led to the proposal that the MITF-M promoter is transactivated by EWSR1-ATF1. The AFH, however, did not express the MITF-M transcript, supporting the theory that MITF-M expression in CCS is a reflection of its cellular origin, rather than a consequence of the presence of an EWSR1-ATF1 fusion protein. Activation of the EWSR1-ATF1 oncogene is probably an early step in the transformation process, but the overall gene expression patterns are likely to vary considerably between AFH and CCS, in keeping with their clinicopathologic differences.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
17426099,PAX4 mutations in Thais with maturity onset diabetes of the young.,"Six maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes have been discovered to date but account for a small proportion of MODY among Asians, suggesting the existence of other MODY genes in this racial group.The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not genetic variants in PAX4, a crucial transcription factor in beta-cell development, contribute to MODY in Thais.We screened PAX4 coding sequences in 46 MODY probands without mutation in known MODY genes and in 74 nondiabetic controls using PCR-single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis followed by direct sequencing. Genotyping of variants identified was done by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.Eight sequence differences were identified. Two novel variations (R164W and IVS7-1G>A) were found in two different probands. Neither was found in the 74 nondiabetic controls and additional 270 healthy subjects of Thai origin. R164W segregated with diabetes in the family of the proband and in vitro studies showed that it impairs the repressor activity of PAX4 on the insulin and glucagon promoters. The remaining six variants were previously described and observed in both groups. One of them, R192H, was three times more frequent in MODY probands than in 342 nondiabetic controls (minor allele frequency = 0.196 vs. 0.064; P < 0.00001). The same variant was associated with a younger age at diagnosis among 254 Thai subjects with adult-onset type 2 diabetes (44.6 +/- 15 vs. 49.7 +/- 11 yr; P = 0.048).We have identified two possible pathogenic mutations of PAX4, R164W, and IVS7-1G>A. For one of these, we have shown evidence of segregation with diabetes and a functional impact on PAX4 activity. Single-nucleotide polymorphism R192H might influence the age at onset of diabetes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18372901,Genome-wide association scan identifies a colorectal cancer susceptibility locus on 11q23 and replicates risk loci at 8q24 and 18q21.,"In a genome-wide association study to identify loci associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, we genotyped 555,510 SNPs in 1,012 early-onset Scottish CRC cases and 1,012 controls (phase 1). In phase 2, we genotyped the 15,008 highest-ranked SNPs in 2,057 Scottish cases and 2,111 controls. We then genotyped the five highest-ranked SNPs from the joint phase 1 and 2 analysis in 14,500 cases and 13,294 controls from seven populations, and identified a previously unreported association, rs3802842 on 11q23 (OR = 1.1; P = 5.8 x 10(-10)), showing population differences in risk. We also replicated and fine-mapped associations at 8q24 (rs7014346; OR = 1.19; P = 8.6 x 10(-26)) and 18q21 (rs4939827; OR = 1.2; P = 7.8 x 10(-28)). Risk was greater for rectal than for colon cancer for rs3802842 (P < 0.008) and rs4939827 (P < 0.009). Carrying all six possible risk alleles yielded OR = 2.6 (95% CI = 1.75-3.89) for CRC. These findings extend our understanding of the role of common genetic variation in CRC etiology.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
16772329,Kv1.5 channelopathy due to KCNA5 loss-of-function mutation causes human atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation is a rhythm disorder characterized by chaotic electrical activity of cardiac atria. Predisposing to stroke and heart failure, this common condition is increasingly recognized as a heritable disorder. To identify genetic defects conferring disease susceptibility, patients with idiopathic atrial fibrillation, lacking traditional risk factors, were evaluated. Genomic DNA scanning revealed a nonsense mutation in KCNA5 that encodes Kv1.5, a voltage-gated potassium channel expressed in human atria. The heterozygous E375X mutation, present in a familial case of atrial fibrillation and absent in 540 unrelated control individuals, introduced a premature stop codon disrupting the Kv1.5 channel protein. The truncation eliminated the S4-S6 voltage sensor, pore region and C-terminus, preserving the N-terminus and S1-S3 transmembrane domains that secure tetrameric subunit assembly. Heterologously expressed recombinant E375X mutant failed to generate the ultrarapid delayed rectifier current I(Kur) vital for atrial repolarization and exerted a dominant-negative effect on wild-type current. Loss of channel function translated into action potential prolongation and early after-depolarization in human atrial myocytes, increasing vulnerability to stress-provoked triggered activity. The pathogenic link between compromised Kv1.5 function and susceptibility to atrial fibrillation was verified, at the organism level, in a murine model. Rescue of the genetic defect was achieved by aminoglycoside-induced translational read-through of the E375X premature stop codon, restoring channel function. This first report of Kv1.5 loss-of-function channelopathy establishes KCNA5 mutation as a novel risk factor for repolarization deficiency and atrial fibrillation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
21248748,The phenotype of recurrent 10q22q23 deletions and duplications.,"The genomic architecture of the 10q22q23 region is characterised by two low-copy repeats (LCRs3 and 4), and deletions in this region appear to be rare. We report the clinical and molecular characterisation of eight novel deletions and six duplications within the 10q22.3q23.3 region. Five deletions and three duplications occur between LCRs3 and 4, whereas three deletions and three duplications have unique breakpoints. Most of the individuals with the LCR3-4 deletion had developmental delay, mainly affecting speech. In addition, macrocephaly, mild facial dysmorphisms, cerebellar anomalies, cardiac defects and congenital breast aplasia were observed. For congenital breast aplasia, the NRG3 gene, known to be involved in early mammary gland development in mice, is a putative candidate gene. For cardiac defects, BMPR1A and GRID1 are putative candidate genes because of their association with cardiac structure and function. Duplications between LCRs3 and 4 are associated with variable phenotypic penetrance. Probands had speech and/or motor delays and dysmorphisms including a broad forehead, deep-set eyes, upslanting palpebral fissures, a smooth philtrum and a thin upper lip. In conclusion, duplications between LCRs3 and 4 on 10q22.3q23.2 may lead to a distinct facial appearance and delays in speech and motor development. However, the phenotypic spectrum is broad, and duplications have also been found in healthy family members of a proband. Reciprocal deletions lead to speech and language delay, mild facial dysmorphisms and, in some individuals, to cerebellar, breast developmental and cardiac defects.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
20345475,Clinical and molecular characterization of individuals with recurrent genomic disorder at 10q22.3q23.2.,"The identification of genomic imbalances in young patients can affect medical management by allowing early intervention for developmental delay and by identifying patients at risk for unexpected medical complications. Using a 105K-feature oligonucleotide array, we identified a 7.25 Mb deletion at 10q22.3q23.2 in six unrelated patients. Deletions of this region have been described in individuals with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, including autistic features, and may represent a recurring genetic syndrome. All four patients in this study for whom clinical information was available had mild dysmorphic features and three had developmental delay. Of note is the emerging clinical phenotype in these individuals with similar dysmorphic features such as macrocephaly, hypertelorism, and arachnodactyly, and neurodevelopmental delay that includes failure to thrive, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties in the neonatal period, and receptive and expressive language delay with global neurodevelopmental delay after the neonatal period. However, there is no pattern of abnormalities, craniofacial, behavioral, or otherwise, that would have aroused clinical suspicion of a specific syndrome. Finally, the patients' deletions encompass BMPR1A but not PTEN, and these patients may be at risk for colon cancer and should be referred for appropriate prophylactic care and surveillance. Of the two patients in this study who had colonoscopy following the array results, neither had polyps. Therefore, the magnitude of the increased risk for colon cancer is currently unknown.",journal article; case reports
18514161,Hyperglycosylation and reduced GABA currents of mutated GABRB3 polypeptide in remitting childhood absence epilepsy.,"Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) accounts for 10% to 12% of epilepsy in children under 16 years of age. We screened for mutations in the GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) beta 3 subunit gene (GABRB3) in 48 probands and families with remitting CAE. We found that four out of 48 families (8%) had mutations in GABRB3. One heterozygous missense mutation (P11S) in exon 1a segregated with four CAE-affected persons in one multiplex, two-generation Mexican family. P11S was also found in a singleton from Mexico. Another heterozygous missense mutation (S15F) was present in a singleton from Honduras. An exon 2 heterozygous missense mutation (G32R) was present in two CAE-affected persons and two persons affected with EEG-recorded spike and/or sharp wave in a two-generation Honduran family. All mutations were absent in 630 controls. We studied functions and possible pathogenicity by expressing mutations in HeLa cells with the use of Western blots and an in vitro translation and translocation system. Expression levels did not differ from those of controls, but all mutations showed hyperglycosylation in the in vitro translation and translocation system with canine microsomes. Functional analysis of human GABA(A) receptors (alpha 1 beta 3-v2 gamma 2S, alpha 1 beta 3-v2[P11S]gamma 2S, alpha 1 beta 3-v2[S15F]gamma 2S, and alpha 1 beta 3-v2[G32R]gamma 2S) transiently expressed in HEK293T cells with the use of rapid agonist application showed that each amino acid transversion in the beta 3-v2 subunit (P11S, S15F, and G32R) reduced GABA-evoked current density from whole cells. Mutated beta 3 subunit protein could thus cause absence seizures through a gain in glycosylation of mutated exon 1a and exon 2, affecting maturation and trafficking of GABAR from endoplasmic reticulum to cell surface and resulting in reduced GABA-evoked currents.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29100093,"De Novo Mutations in SLC25A24 Cause a Craniosynostosis Syndrome with Hypertrichosis, Progeroid Appearance, and Mitochondrial Dysfunction.","Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome (GCMS) is a dysmorphic syndrome characterized by coronal craniosynostosis and severe midface hypoplasia, body and facial hypertrichosis, microphthalmia, short stature, and short distal phalanges. Variable lipoatrophy and cutis laxa are the basis for a progeroid appearance. Using exome and genome sequencing, we identified the recurrent de novo mutations c.650G>A (p.Arg217His) and c.649C>T (p.Arg217Cys) in SLC25A24 in five unrelated girls diagnosed with GCMS. Two of the girls had pronounced neonatal progeroid features and were initially diagnosed with Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome. SLC25A24 encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane ATP-Mg/Pi carrier. In fibroblasts from affected individuals, the mutated SLC25A24 showed normal stability. In contrast to control cells, the probands' cells showed mitochondrial swelling, which was exacerbated upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The same effect was observed after overexpression of the mutant cDNA. Under normal culture conditions, the mitochondrial membrane potential of the probands' fibroblasts was intact, whereas ATP content in the mitochondrial matrix was lower than that in control cells. However, upon H2O2 exposure, the membrane potential was significantly elevated in cells harboring the mutated SLC25A24. No reduction of mitochondrial DNA copy number was observed. These findings demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction with increased sensitivity to oxidative stress is due to the SLC25A24 mutations. Our results suggest that the SLC25A24 mutations induce a gain of pathological function and link mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi transport to the development of skeletal and connective tissue.",brief-report; journal article
18674751,Mutations in the cilia gene ARL13B lead to the classical form of Joubert syndrome.,"Joubert syndrome (JS) and related disorders are a group of autosomal-recessive conditions sharing the ""molar tooth sign"" on axial brain MRI, together with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, ataxia, and psychomotor delay. JS is suggested to be a disorder of cilia function and is part of a spectrum of disorders involving retinal, renal, digital, oral, hepatic, and cerebral organs. We identified mutations in ARL13B in two families with the classical form of JS. ARL13B belongs to the Ras GTPase family, and in other species is required for ciliogenesis, body axis formation, and renal function. The encoded Arl13b protein was expressed in developing murine cerebellum and localized to the cilia in primary neurons. Overexpression of human wild-type but not patient mutant ARL13B rescued the Arl13b scorpion zebrafish mutant. Thus, ARL13B has an evolutionarily conserved role mediating cilia function in multiple organs.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article"
27151206,KCNK9 imprinting syndrome-further delineation of a possible treatable disorder.,"Patients with KCNK9 imprinting syndrome demonstrate congenital hypotonia, variable cleft palate, normal MRIs and EEGs, delayed development, and feeding problems. Associated facial dysmorphic features include dolichocephaly with bitemporal narrowing, short philtrum, tented upper lip, palatal abnormalities, and small mandible. This disorder maps to chromosomal region 8q24, and it is caused by a specific missense mutation 770G>A in exon 2, replacing glycine at position 236 by arginine (G236R) in the maternal copy of KCNK9 within this locus. KCNK9 (also called TASK3) encodes a member of the two pore- domain potassium channel (K2P) subfamily. This gene is normally imprinted with paternal silencing, thus a mutation in the maternal copy of the gene will result in disease, whereas a mutation in the paternal copy will have no effect. Exome sequencing in four new patients with developmental delay and central hypotonia revealed de novo G236R mutations. Older members of a previously reported Arab-Israeli family have intellectual disability of variable severity, persistent feeding difficulties in infancy with dysphagia of liquids and dysphonia with a muffled voice in early adulthood, generalized hypotonia, weakness of proximal muscles, elongated face with narrow bitemporal diameter, and reduced facial movements. We describe the clinical features in four recently recognized younger patients and compare them with those found in members of the originally reported Arab-Israeli family and suggest this may be a treatable disorder.

1382994,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria due to hereditary nucleotide deletion in the HRF20 (CD59) gene.,"HRF20 (CD59) is a membrane glycoprotein which protects cells from the membrane attack reaction of homologous complement. A patient who is completely deficient in HRF20 expression and is suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) was studied. His parents are cousins and both have decreased HRF20 expression, suggesting that the deficiency is genetic. We established a cultured cell line (NCU1) which is HRF20 deficient from the patient's lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) infection. Northern blot analysis revealed HRF20 mRNA signals, indicating that HRF20 mRNA were transcribed. HRF20 cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Sequencing of the cDNA from the NCU1 showed two single-base deletions at amino acid 16 and 96 from the N terminus of the mature protein. Deletion in the genomic DNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes was confirmed by the DNA sequence of an HRF20 open reading frame containing amino acid 16. Furthermore, the patient's parents and sister possessed both intact and deleted genomic HRF20 DNA while his brother's DNA was intact. These findings demonstrate that the HRF20 deficiency was genomic in origin, and that complete deletion was brought about by a homozygous abnormality in the HRF20 gene. The base deletion caused a codon frame shift resulting in failure to produce intact HRF20 protein in the patient.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18606301,Human osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis with hypogammaglobulinemia due to TNFRSF11A (RANK) mutations.,"Autosomal-Recessive Osteopetrosis (ARO) comprises a heterogeneous group of bone diseases for which mutations in five genes are known as causative. Most ARO are classified as osteoclast-rich, but recently a subset of osteoclast-poor ARO has been recognized as due to a defect in TNFSF11 (also called RANKL or TRANCE, coding for the RANKL protein), a master gene driving osteoclast differentiation along the RANKL-RANK axis. RANKL and RANK (coded for by the TNFRSF11A gene) also play a role in the immune system, which raises the possibility that defects in this pathway might cause osteopetrosis with immunodeficiency. From a large series of ARO patients we selected a Turkish consanguineous family with two siblings affected by ARO and hypogammaglobulinemia with no defects in known osteopetrosis genes. Sequencing of genes involved in the RANKL downstream pathway identified a homozygous mutation in the TNFRSF11A gene in both siblings. Their monocytes failed to differentiate in vitro into osteoclasts upon exposure to M-CSF and RANKL, in keeping with an osteoclast-intrinsic defect. Immunological analysis showed that their hypogammaglobulinemia was associated with impairment in immunoglobulin-secreting B cells. Investigation of other patients revealed a defect in both TNFRSF11A alleles in six additional, unrelated families. Our results indicate that TNFRSF11A mutations can cause a clinical condition in which severe ARO is associated with an immunoglobulin-production defect.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

It is rarely associated with short stature. FIGLA mutations with POI are identified with regard to heterozygosity; till date, only one affected family has been identified with homozygous mutations in FIGLA but without functional evaluation. Here, we described two POI patients from a consanguineous family from China. An 18-year-old girl and her sister presented with primary amenorrhea and increased FSH and luteinizing hormone levels, but the sister also presented with short stature and bone age delay. Whole-genome sequencing analysis identified a recurrent homozygous mutation in the FIGLA gene, c.2 T > C (p.Met1Thr), in this family member with POI; this variant was segregated within the pedigree. This change was absent in 382 control subjects, and we did not detect any mutations in 39 other idiopathic POI patients. in vitro functional analysis indicates that the p.Met1Thr mutation does not affect the transcription of the FIGLA gene, but blocks the synthesis of the full-length FIGLA protein. Our results support the notion that bi-allelic recessive loss-of-function effects of FIGLA contribute to POI patients with short stature and expand the FIGLA-related phenotypic spectrum.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
18678321,Germline mutations and variants in the succinate dehydrogenase genes in Cowden and Cowden-like syndromes.,"Individuals with PTEN mutations have Cowden syndrome (CS), associated with breast, thyroid, and endometrial neoplasias. Many more patients with features of CS, not meeting diagnostic criteria (termed CS-like), are evaluated by clinicians for CS-related cancer risk. Germline mutations in succinate dehydrogenase subunits SDHB-D cause pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome. One to five percent of SDHB/SDHD mutation carriers have renal cell or papillary thyroid carcinomas, which are also CS-related features. SDHB-D may be candidate susceptibility genes for some PTEN mutation-negative individuals with CS-like cancers. To address this hypothesis, germline SDHB-D mutation analysis in 375 PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like individuals was performed, followed by functional analysis of identified SDH mutations/variants. Of 375 PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like individuals, 74 (20%) had increased manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) expression, a manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction. Among these, 10 (13.5%) had germline mutations/variants in SDHB (n = 3) or SDHD (7), not found in 700 controls (p < 0.001). Compared to PTEN mutation-positive CS/CS-like individuals, those with SDH mutations/variants were enriched for carcinomas of the female breast (6/9 SDH versus 30/107 PTEN, p < 0.001), thyroid (5/10 versus 15/106, p < 0.001), and kidney (2/10 versus 4/230, p = 0.026). In the absence of PTEN alteration, CS/CS-like-related SDH mutations/variants show increased phosphorylation of AKT and/or MAPK, downstream manifestations of PTEN dysfunction. Germline SDH mutations/variants occur in a subset of PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like individuals and are associated with increased frequencies of breast, thyroid, and renal cancers beyond those conferred by germline PTEN mutations. SDH testing should be considered for germline PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like individuals, especially in the setting of breast, thyroid, and/or renal cancers.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18834967,"Mutations in CHD7, encoding a chromatin-remodeling protein, cause idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and Kallmann syndrome.","CHARGE syndrome and Kallmann syndrome (KS) are two distinct developmental disorders sharing overlapping features of impaired olfaction and hypogonadism. KS is a genetically heterogeneous disorder consisting of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and anosmia, and is most commonly due to KAL1 or FGFR1 mutations. CHARGE syndrome, a multisystem autosomal-dominant disorder, is caused by CHD7 mutations. We hypothesized that CHD7 would be involved in the pathogenesis of IHH and KS (IHH/KS) without the CHARGE phenotype and that IHH/KS represents a milder allelic variant of CHARGE syndrome. Mutation screening of the 37 protein-coding exons of CHD7 was performed in 101 IHH/KS patients without a CHARGE phenotype. In an additional 96 IHH/KS patients, exons 6-10, encoding the conserved chromodomains, were sequenced. RT-PCR, SIFT, protein-structure analysis, and in situ hybridization were performed for additional supportive evidence. Seven heterozygous mutations, two splice and five missense, which were absent in > or = 180 controls, were identified in three sporadic KS and four sporadic normosmic IHH patients. Three mutations affect chromodomains critical for proper CHD7 function in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, whereas the other four affect conserved residues, suggesting that they are deleterious. CHD7's role is further corroborated by specific expression in IHH/KS-relevant tissues and appropriate developmental expression. Sporadic CHD7 mutations occur in 6% of IHH/KS patients. CHD7 represents the first identified chromatin-remodeling protein with a role in human puberty and the second gene to cause both normosmic IHH and KS in humans. Our findings indicate that both normosmic IHH and KS are mild allelic variants of CHARGE syndrome and are caused by CHD7 mutations.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
1652368,"Chromosomal translocation t(15;17) in human acute promyelocytic leukemia fuses RAR alpha with a novel putative transcription factor, PML.","A unique mRNA produced in leukemic cells from a t(15;17) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patient encodes a fusion protein between the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) and a myeloid gene product called PML. PML contains a cysteine-rich region present in a new family of apparent DNA-binding proteins that includes a regulator of the interleukin-2 receptor gene (Rpt-1) and the recombination-activating gene product (RAG-1). Accordingly, PML may represent a novel transcription factor or recombinase. The aberrant PML-RAR fusion product, while typically retinoic acid responsive, displays both cell type- and promoter-specific differences from the wild-type RAR alpha. Because patients with APL can be induced into remission with high dose RA therapy, we propose that the nonliganded PML-RAR protein is a new class of dominant negative oncogene product. Treatment with RA would not only relieve this inhibition, but the activated PML-RAR protein may actually promote myelocyte differentiation.",journal article

18950741,DNAI2 mutations cause primary ciliary dyskinesia with defects in the outer dynein arm.,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by chronic destructive airway disease and randomization of left/right body asymmetry. Males often have reduced fertility due to impaired sperm tail function. The complex PCD phenotype results from dysfunction of cilia of the airways and the embryonic node and the structurally related motile sperm flagella. This is associated with underlying ultrastructural defects that frequently involve the outer dynein arm (ODA) complexes that generate cilia and flagella movement. Applying a positional and functional candidate-gene approach, we identified homozygous loss-of-function DNAI2 mutations (IVS11+1G > A) in four individuals from a family with PCD and ODA defects. Further mutational screening of 105 unrelated PCD families detected two distinct homozygous mutations, including a nonsense (c.787C > T) and a splicing mutation (IVS3-3T > G) resulting in out-of-frame transcripts. Analysis of protein expression of the ODA intermediate chain DNAI2 showed sublocalization throughout respiratory cilia. Electron microscopy showed that mutant respiratory cells from these patients lacked DNAI2 protein expression and exhibited ODA defects. High-resolution immunofluorescence imaging demonstrated absence of the ODA heavy chains DNAH5 and DNAH9 from all DNAI2 mutant ciliary axonemes. In addition, we demonstrated complete or distal absence of DNAI2 from ciliary axonemes in respiratory cells of patients with mutations in genes encoding the ODA chains DNAH5 and DNAI1, respectively. Thus, DNAI2 and DNAH5 mutations affect assembly of proximal and distal ODA complexes, whereas DNAI1 mutations mainly disrupt assembly of proximal ODA complexes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
19052621,Ktu/PF13 is required for cytoplasmic pre-assembly of axonemal dyneins.,"Cilia and flagella are highly conserved organelles that have diverse roles in cell motility and sensing extracellular signals. Motility defects in cilia and flagella often result in primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, the mechanisms underlying cilia formation and function, and in particular the cytoplasmic assembly of dyneins that power ciliary motility, are only poorly understood. Here we report a new gene, kintoun (ktu), involved in this cytoplasmic process. This gene was first identified in a medaka mutant, and found to be mutated in primary ciliary dyskinesia patients from two affected families as well as in the pf13 mutant of Chlamydomonas. In the absence of Ktu/PF13, both outer and inner dynein arms are missing or defective in the axoneme, leading to a loss of motility. Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies show that Ktu/PF13 is one of the long-sought proteins involved in pre-assembly of dynein arm complexes in the cytoplasm before intraflagellar transport loads them for the ciliary compartment.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
9313763,Identification of mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha gene in Japanese subjects with IDDM.,"One form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young, MODY3, is characterized by a severe insulin secretory defect, compared with MODY2, a glucokinase-deficient diabetes. It has recently been shown that mutations of the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha cause MODY3. Because of the rapid progress to overt diabetes and the high prevalence of required insulin treatment in patients with MODY3, we screened the HNF-1 alpha gene for mutations in Japanese subjects with IDDM. Ten exons and flanking introns of the HNF-1 alpha gene in these subjects were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of the products. Mutations were identified in three (5.5%) of the 55 unrelated subjects with IDDM. A missense mutation of R272H (replacement of Arg by His in codon 272) in the DNA binding domain of HNF-1 alpha was found in a subject who developed IDDM 1 year after diagnosis of NIDDM at 8 years of age. A frameshift mutation of P291 fsinsC (insertion of a C in a polyC tract around codon 291 for Pro), which would generate a mutant truncated protein of 340 amino acids, was found in a subject who started insulin treatment when hyperglycemia and ketonuria were noticed at 13 years of age. A missense mutation of R583G (replacement of Arg by Gly in codon 583) in the transactivation domain of HNF-1 alpha was found in a subject with sudden-onset IDDM at 20 years of age. None of these mutations were present in 100 nondiabetic subjects (200 normal chromosomes). These results indicate that the HNF-1 alpha gene defects could lead to the development of not only early-onset NIDDM but also IDDM, implicating the importance of subclassification of HNF-1 alpha-deficient IDDM from a classical type of autoimmune-based IDDM in Japanese.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18211975,Association of a homozygous nonsense caveolin-1 mutation with Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy.,"CONTEXT: Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL) is a rare recessive disease characterized by near absence of adipose tissue, resulting in severe dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. In most reported cases, BSCL is due to alterations in either seipin, of unknown function, or 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-beta (AGPAT2), which catalyzes the formation of phosphatidic acid. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the genetic origin of the unexplained cases of BSCL. We thus sequenced CAV1, encoding caveolin-1, as a candidate gene involved in insulin signaling and lipid homeostasis. CAV1 is a key structural component of plasma membrane caveolae, and Cav1-deficient mice display progressive loss of adipose tissue and insulin resistance. DESIGN: We undertook phenotyping studies and molecular screening of CAV1 in four patients with BSCL with no mutation in the genes encoding either seipin or AGPAT2. RESULTS: A homozygous nonsense mutation (p.Glu38X) was identified in CAV1 in a patient with BSCL born from a consanguineous union. This mutation affects both the alpha- and beta-CAV1 isoforms and ablates CAV1 expression in skin fibroblasts. Detailed magnetic resonance imaging of the proband confirmed near total absence of both sc and visceral adipose tissue, with only vestigial amounts in the dorsal sc regions. In keeping with the lack of adipose tissue, the proband was also severely insulin resistant and dyslipidemic. In addition, the proband had mild hypocalcemia likely due to vitamin D resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify CAV1 as a new BSCL-related gene and support a critical role for caveolins in human adipocyte function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20378560,Mutations in the ribosomal protein genes in Japanese patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.,"BACKGROUND: Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare, clinically heterogeneous, congenital red cell aplasia: 40% of patients have congenital abnormalities. Recent studies have shown that in western countries, the disease is associated with heterozygous mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) genes in about 50% of patients. There have been no studies to determine the incidence of these mutations in Asian patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened 49 Japanese patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (45 probands) for mutations in the six known genes associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia: RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A. RPS14 was also examined due to its implied involvement in 5q- syndrome. RESULTS: Mutations in RPS19, RPL5, RPL11 and RPS17 were identified in five, four, two and one of the probands, respectively. In total, 12 (27%) of the Japanese Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients had mutations in ribosomal protein genes. No mutations were detected in RPS14, RPS24 or RPL35A. All patients with RPS19 and RPL5 mutations had physical abnormalities. Remarkably, cleft palate was seen in two patients with RPL5 mutations, and thumb anomalies were seen in six patients with an RPS19 or RPL5 mutation. In contrast, a small-for-date phenotype was seen in five patients without an RPL5 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a slightly lower frequency of mutations in the ribosomal protein genes in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia compared to the frequency reported in western countries. Genotype-phenotype data suggest an association between anomalies and RPS19 mutations, and a negative association between small-for-date phenotype and RPL5 mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; multicenter study; journal article"
18535205,"Abnormalities of the large ribosomal subunit protein, Rpl35a, in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.","Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by anemia, congenital abnormalities, and cancer predisposition. Small ribosomal subunit genes RPS19, RPS24, and RPS17 are mutated in approximately one-third of patients. We used a candidate gene strategy combining high-resolution genomic mapping and gene expression microarray in the analysis of 2 DBA patients with chromosome 3q deletions to identify RPL35A as a potential DBA gene. Sequence analysis of a cohort of DBA probands confirmed involvement RPL35A in DBA. shRNA inhibition shows that Rpl35a is essential for maturation of 28S and 5.8S rRNAs, 60S subunit biogenesis, normal proliferation, and cell survival. Analysis of pre-rRNA processing in primary DBA lymphoblastoid cell lines demonstrated similar alterations of large ribosomal subunit rRNA in both RPL35A-mutated and some RPL35A wild-type patients, suggesting additional large ribosomal subunit gene defects are likely present in some cases of DBA. These data demonstrate that alterations of large ribosomal subunit proteins cause DBA and support the hypothesis that DBA is primarily the result of altered ribosomal function. The results also establish that haploinsufficiency of large ribosomal subunit proteins contributes to bone marrow failure and potentially cancer predisposition.",review-article; review; journal article
19061985,Ribosomal protein L5 and L11 mutations are associated with cleft palate and abnormal thumbs in Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients.,"Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital bone-marrow-failure syndrome, is characterized by red blood cell aplasia, macrocytic anemia, clinical heterogeneity, and increased risk of malignancy. Although anemia is the most prominent feature of DBA, the disease is also characterized by growth retardation and congenital anomalies that are present in approximately 30%-50% of patients. The disease has been associated with mutations in four ribosomal protein (RP) genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A, in about 30% of patients. However, the genetic basis of the remaining 70% of cases is still unknown. Here, we report the second known mutation in RPS17 and probable pathogenic mutations in three more RP genes, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7. In addition, we identified rare variants of unknown significance in three other genes, RPL36, RPS15, and RPS27A. Remarkably, careful review of the clinical data showed that mutations in RPL5 are associated with multiple physical abnormalities, including craniofacial, thumb, and heart anomalies, whereas isolated thumb malformations are predominantly present in patients carrying mutations in RPL11. We also demonstrate that mutations of RPL5, RPL11, or RPS7 in DBA cells is associated with diverse defects in the maturation of ribosomal RNAs in the large or the small ribosomal subunit production pathway, expanding the repertoire of ribosomal RNA processing defects associated with DBA.",review-article; review; journal article
19890111,Inflammatory bowel disease and mutations affecting the interleukin-10 receptor.,"BACKGROUND:The molecular cause of inflammatory bowel disease is largely unknown. METHODS:We performed genetic-linkage analysis and candidate-gene sequencing on samples from two unrelated consanguineous families with children who were affected by early-onset inflammatory bowel disease. We screened six additional patients with early-onset colitis for mutations in two candidate genes and carried out functional assays in patients' peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. We performed an allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in one patient. RESULTS:In four of nine patients with early-onset colitis, we identified three distinct homozygous mutations in genes IL10RA and IL10RB, encoding the IL10R1 and IL10R2 proteins, respectively, which form a heterotetramer to make up the interleukin-10 receptor. The mutations abrogate interleukin-10-induced signaling, as shown by deficient STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation on stimulation with interleukin-10. Consistent with this observation was the increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha and other proinflammatory cytokines from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from patients who were deficient in IL10R subunit proteins, suggesting that interleukin-10-dependent ""negative feedback"" regulation is disrupted in these cells. The allogeneic stem-cell transplantation performed in one patient was successful. CONCLUSIONS:Mutations in genes encoding the IL10R subunit proteins were found in patients with early-onset enterocolitis, involving hyperinflammatory immune responses in the intestine. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation resulted in disease remission in one patient.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18806796,Insights from retinitis pigmentosa into the roles of isocitrate dehydrogenases in the Krebs cycle.,"Here we describe two families with retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary neurodegeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina. Affected family members were homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in IDH3B, encoding the beta-subunit of NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD-IDH, or IDH3), which is believed to catalyze the oxidation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle. Cells from affected individuals had a substantial reduction of NAD-IDH activity, with about a 300-fold increase in the K(m) for NAD. NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-IDH, or IDH2), an enzyme that catalyzes the same reaction, was normal in affected individuals, and they had no health problems associated with the enzyme deficiency except for retinitis pigmentosa. These findings support the hypothesis that mitochondrial NADP-IDH, rather than NAD-IDH, serves as the main catalyst for this reaction in the citric acid cycle outside the retina, and that the retina has a particular requirement for NAD-IDH.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

19012874,Alterations in CDH15 and KIRREL3 in patients with mild to severe intellectual disability.,"Cell-adhesion molecules play critical roles in brain development, as well as maintaining synaptic structure, function, and plasticity. Here we have found the disruption of two genes encoding putative cell-adhesion molecules, CDH15 (cadherin superfamily) and KIRREL3 (immunoglobulin superfamily), by a chromosomal translocation t(11;16) in a female patient with intellectual disability (ID). We screened coding regions of these two genes in a cohort of patients with ID and controls and identified four nonsynonymous CDH15 variants and three nonsynonymous KIRREL3 variants that appear rare and unique to ID. These variations altered highly conserved residues and were absent in more than 600 unrelated patients with ID and 800 control individuals. Furthermore, in vivo expression studies showed that three of the CDH15 variations adversely altered its ability to mediate cell-cell adhesion. We also show that in neuronal cells, human KIRREL3 colocalizes and interacts with the synaptic scaffolding protein, CASK, recently implicated in X-linked brain malformation and ID. Taken together, our data suggest that alterations in CDH15 and KIRREL3, either alone or in combination with other factors, could play a role in phenotypic expression of ID in some patients.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19030898,A novel locus DFNA59 for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss maps at chromosome 11p14.2-q12.3.,"Autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL) accounts for about one-fifth of hereditary hearing loss in humans. In the present study, we have analyzed a three-generation family with 14 of its members manifesting ADNSHL, using a genome-wide linkage mapping approach. We found a novel locus DFNA59 between the D11S929 and D11S480 markers in the chromosome location 11p14.2-q12.3. The highest two-point lod score of 5.72 at recombination fraction = 0 was obtained for D11S4152, D11S4154, D11S1301, D11S905 and D11S1344. The critical genomic region comprising about 37 megabases of DNA is proposed to carry a gene for ADNSHL in the family. About 50 cochlear-expressed genes mapping to the region are strong candidates which we propose to examine to identify the gene responsible for the hearing impairment.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
23993197,Loss-of-function mutations in RSPH1 cause primary ciliary dyskinesia with central-complex and radial-spoke defects.,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare autosomal-recessive respiratory disorder resulting from defects of motile cilia. Various axonemal ultrastructural phenotypes have been observed, including one with so-called central-complex (CC) defects, whose molecular basis remains unexplained in most cases. To identify genes involved in this phenotype, whose diagnosis can be particularly difficult to establish, we combined homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in a consanguineous individual with CC defects. This identified a nonsense mutation in RSPH1, a gene whose ortholog in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii encodes a radial-spoke (RS)-head protein and is mainly expressed in respiratory and testis cells. Subsequent analyses of RSPH1 identified biallelic mutations in 10 of 48 independent families affected by CC defects. These mutations include splicing defects, as demonstrated by the study of RSPH1 transcripts obtained from airway cells of affected individuals. Wild-type RSPH1 localizes within cilia of airway cells, but we were unable to detect it in an individual with RSPH1 loss-of-function mutations. High-speed-videomicroscopy analyses revealed the coexistence of different ciliary beating patterns-cilia with a normal beat frequency but abnormal motion alongside immotile cilia or cilia with a slowed beat frequency-in each individual. This study shows that this gene is mutated in 20.8% of individuals with CC defects, whose diagnosis could now be improved by molecular screening. RSPH1 mutations thus appear as a major etiology for this PCD phenotype, which in fact includes RS defects, thereby unveiling the importance of RSPH1 in the proper building of CCs and RSs in humans.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19200523,Mutations in radial spoke head protein genes RSPH9 and RSPH4A cause primary ciliary dyskinesia with central-microtubular-pair abnormalities.,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous inherited disorder arising from dysmotility of motile cilia and sperm. This is associated with a variety of ultrastructural defects of the cilia and sperm axoneme that affect movement, leading to clinical consequences on respiratory-tract mucociliary clearance and lung function, fertility, and left-right body-axis determination. We performed whole-genome SNP-based linkage analysis in seven consanguineous families with PCD and central-microtubular-pair abnormalities. This identified two loci, in two families with intermittent absence of the central-pair structure (chromosome 6p21.1, Zmax 6.7) and in five families with complete absence of the central pair (chromosome 6q22.1, Zmax 7.0). Mutations were subsequently identified in two positional candidate genes, RSPH9 on chromosome 6p21.1 and RSPH4A on chromosome 6q22.1. Haplotype analysis identified a common ancestral founder effect RSPH4A mutation present in UK-Pakistani pedigrees. Both RSPH9 and RSPH4A encode protein components of the axonemal radial spoke head. In situ hybridization of murine Rsph9 shows gene expression restricted to regions containing motile cilia. Investigation of the effect of knockdown or mutations of RSPH9 orthologs in zebrafish and Chlamydomonas indicate that radial spoke head proteins are important in maintaining normal movement in motile, ""9+2""-structure cilia and flagella. This effect is rescued by reintroduction of gene expression for restoration of a normal beat pattern in zebrafish. Disturbance in function of these genes was not associated with defects in left-right axis determination in humans or zebrafish.",review-article; review; journal article
18654668,Mutant prominin 1 found in patients with macular degeneration disrupts photoreceptor disk morphogenesis in mice.,"Familial macular degeneration is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by progressive central vision loss. Here we show that an R373C missense mutation in the prominin 1 gene (PROM1) causes 3 forms of autosomal-dominant macular degeneration. In transgenic mice expressing R373C mutant human PROM1, both mutant and endogenous PROM1 were found throughout the layers of the photoreceptors, rather than at the base of the photoreceptor outer segments, where PROM1 is normally localized. Moreover, the outer segment disk membranes were greatly overgrown and misoriented, indicating defective disk morphogenesis. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that PROM1 interacted with protocadherin 21 (PCDH21), a photoreceptor-specific cadherin, and with actin filaments, both of which play critical roles in disk membrane morphogenesis. Collectively, our results identify what we believe to be a novel complex involved in photoreceptor disk morphogenesis and indicate a possible role for PROM1 and PCDH21 in macular degeneration.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26702251,An intronic deletion in the PROM1 gene leads to autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy.,"To investigate the genetic basis for autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) in a consanguineous Israeli Jewish family.Patients underwent a detailed ophthalmic evaluation, including eye examination, visual field testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electrophysiological tests, electroretinography (ERG) and visual evoked potential (VEP). Genome-wide homozygosity mapping using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array was performed to identify homozygous regions shared among two of the affected individuals. Mutation screening of the underlying gene was performed with direct sequencing. In silico and in vitro analyses were used to predict the effect of the identified mutation on splicing.The affected family members are three siblings who have various degrees of progressive visual deterioration, glare, color vision abnormalities, and night vision difficulties. Visual field tests revealed central scotomas of different extension. Cone and rod ERG responses were reduced, with cones more severely affected. Homozygosity mapping revealed several homozygous intervals shared among two of the affected individuals. One included the PROM1 gene. Sequence analysis of the 26 coding exons of PROM1 in one affected individual revealed no mutations in the coding sequence or in intronic splice sites. However, in intron 21, proximate to the intron-exon junction, we observed a homozygous 10 bp deletion between positions -26 and -17 (c.2281-26_-17del). The deletion was linked to a known SNP, c.2281-6C>G. The deletion cosegregated with the disease in the family, and was not detected in public databases or in 101 ethnically-matched control individuals. In silico analysis predicted that this deletion would lead to altered intron 21 splicing. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that a recognition site for the SRSF2 splicing factor is located within the deleted sequence. The in vitro splicing assay demonstrated that c.2281-26_-17del leads to complete exon 22 skipping.A novel and unique intronic mutation of PROM1, underlying autosomal recessive CRD in a consanguineous Israeli family, was found.

Protein 4.2 was absent from red cell ghosts by Western blotting. Although the 4.2 mRNA was not detected in Northern blots, it was shown to be present by a procedure based on nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Partial nucleotide sequencing disclosed a one-nucleotide deletion at nt 264 (or 265): AAG GTG-->AAG TG, in codon 88 (or 89) belonging to exon 2. This change, defining allele 4.2 Lisboa, placed in frame the nonsense triplet that normally overlaps codons 136 and 137 (GTG ACC). This mutation, which abolishes an EcoNI site, was also found in the gene of the proband (homozygous state), her parents, and her brother (heterozygous state). Apart from anemia, the patient was free of clinical manifestations. Platelet membranes were also investigated using Western blots. Antibodies to red cell protein 4.2 showed a doublet (72 and 70 kD) both in the controls and the patient. This finding raises an interesting question concerning the relationship between this doublet and erythroid protein 4.2.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
15241655,Heterozygous mutation in 5'-untranslated region of sepiapterin reductase gene (SPR) in a patient with dopa-responsive dystonia.,The search for mutations in genes coding for components of the biopterin pathway other than GTPCH1 revealed a mutation in the gene coding for sepiapterin reductase (SPR) in 1 of 95 patients with GCH1-negative dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). The mutation detected in SPR is a G-->A transition at position -13 of the untranslated region of the gene. This resulted in drastically reduced activity of sepiapterin reductase in the patient's fibroblasts. The findings indicate that haploinsufficiency of SPR can be a rare cause of DRD.,"research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20682460,l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency: clinical presentation and response to treatment in two patients with a novel mutation.,"Creatine and creatine phosphate provide storage and transmission of phosphate-bound energy in muscle and brain. Of the three inborn errors of creatine metabolism causing brain creatine depletion, l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency has been described in only two families. We describe clinical and biochemical features, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) findings and response to creatine supplementation in two siblings with a novel mutation in the AGAT-encoding GATM gene. The sister and brother were evaluated at age 12 and 18years, respectively, because of mild mental retardation, muscle weakness and low weight. Extensive work-up had previously yielded negative results. Electron microscopy of the muscle revealed tubular aggregates and the activity of respiratory chain complexes was decreased in the muscle. Urine organic acid concentrations normalized to urine creatinine concentration were all increased, suggesting a creatine metabolism disorder. Brain MRS was remarkable for absence of creatine. Urine guanidinoacetate levels by tandem mass spectrometry were low, suggesting AGAT deficiency. GATM sequencing revealed a homozygous single nucleotide insertion 1111_1112insA, producing a frame-shift at Met-371 and premature termination at codon 376. Eleven months after commencing treatment with oral creatine monohydrate 100mg/kg/day, repeat MRI/MRS showed significantly increased brain creatine in the sister and a slight increase in the older brother. The parents' impression of improved strength and stamina was substantiated by increased post-treatment versus pre-treatment scores in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, straight-arm raising and timed up-and-go tests. Similarly, there was an apparent improvement in cognitive function, with significantly increased IQ-scores in the sister and marginal improvement in the brother.",journal article; case reports
7808840,"Creatine deficiency in the brain: a new, treatable inborn error of metabolism.","In a patient with extrapyramidal movement disorder and extremely low creatinine concentrations in serum and urine, in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy disclosed a generalized depletion of creatinine in the brain. Oral substitution of arginine, a substrate for creatine synthesis, resulted in an increase of brain guanidinoacetate as the immediate precursor of creatine but did not elevate cerebral creatine levels. In contrast, oral substitution of creatine-monohydrate led to a significant increase of brain creatine, a decrease of brain guanidinoacetate, and a normalization of creatinine in serum and urine. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain revealed no detectable creatine-phosphate before oral substitution of creatine and a significant increase afterward. Partial restoration of cerebral creatine concentrations was accompanied by improvement of the patient's neurologic symptoms. This is the first report of a patient with complete creatine deficiency in the brain. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy during arginine and creatine treatment point to an inborn error of creatine biosynthesis at the level of guanidinoacetete-methyltransferase.",journal article; case reports
20876309,Whole-exome sequencing-based discovery of STIM1 deficiency in a child with fatal classic Kaposi sarcoma.,"Classic Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is exceedingly rare in children from the Mediterranean Basin, despite the high prevalence of human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection in this region. We hypothesized that rare single-gene inborn errors of immunity to HHV-8 may underlie classic KS in childhood. We investigated a child with no other unusually severe infectious or tumoral phenotype who died from disseminated KS at two years of age. Whole-exome sequencing in the patient revealed a homozygous splice-site mutation in STIM1, the gene encoding stromal interaction molecule 1, which regulates store-operated Ca(2+) entry. STIM1 mRNA splicing, protein production, and Ca(2+) influx were completely abolished in EBV-transformed B cell lines from the patient, but were rescued by the expression of wild-type STIM1. Based on the previous discovery of STIM1 deficiency in a single family with a severe T cell immunodeficiency and the much higher risk of KS in individuals with acquired T cell deficiencies, we conclude that STIM1 T cell deficiency precipitated the development of lethal KS in this child upon infection with HHV-8. Our report provides the first evidence that isolated classic KS in childhood may result from single-gene defects and provides proof-of-principle that whole-exome sequencing in single patients can decipher the genetic basis of rare inborn errors.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19229252,Novel autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment locus (DFNB71) maps to chromosome 8p22-21.3.,"A novel ARNSHI (autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment) locus, DFNB71, was localized to 8p22-21.3. To map the locus, a whole-genome scan was carried out using DNA samples from a consanguineous seven-generational Pakistani family with profound prelingual ARNSHI. A maximum multipoint LOD score of 4.2 occurred at marker D8S261. The DFNB71 region of homozygosity and 3-unit support interval is flanked by markers D8S1130 and D8S1786.

19110214,"A recessive skeletal dysplasia, SEMD aggrecan type, results from a missense mutation affecting the C-type lectin domain of aggrecan.","Analysis of a nuclear family with three affected offspring identified an autosomal-recessive form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia characterized by severe short stature and a unique constellation of radiographic findings. Homozygosity for a haplotype that was identical by descent between two of the affected individuals identified a locus for the disease gene within a 17.4 Mb interval on chromosome 15, a region containing 296 genes. These genes were assessed and ranked by cartilage selectivity with whole-genome microarray data, revealing only two genes, encoding aggrecan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, that were selectively expressed in cartilage. Sequence analysis of aggrecan complementary DNA from an affected individual revealed homozygosity for a missense mutation (c.6799G --> A) that predicts a p.D2267N amino acid substitution in the C-type lectin domain within the G3 domain of aggrecan. The D2267 residue is predicted to coordinate binding of a calcium ion, which influences the conformational binding loops of the C-type lectin domain that mediate interactions with tenascins and other extracellular-matrix proteins. Expression of the normal and mutant G3 domains in mammalian cells showed that the mutation created a functional N-glycosylation site but did not adversely affect protein trafficking and secretion. Surface-plasmon-resonance studies showed that the mutation influenced the binding and kinetics of the interactions between the aggrecan G3 domain and tenascin-C. These findings identify an autosomal-recessive skeletal dysplasia and a significant role for the aggrecan C-type lectin domain in regulating endochondral ossification and, thereby, height.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18464934,Sodium channel β1 subunit mutations associated with Brugada syndrome and cardiac conduction disease in humans.,"Brugada syndrome is a genetic disease associated with sudden cardiac death that is characterized by ventricular fibrillation and right precordial ST segment elevation on ECG. Loss-of-function mutations in SCN5A, which encodes the predominant cardiac sodium channel alpha subunit NaV1.5, can cause Brugada syndrome and cardiac conduction disease. However, SCN5A mutations are not detected in the majority of patients with these syndromes, suggesting that other genes can cause or modify presentation of these disorders. Here, we investigated SCN1B, which encodes the function-modifying sodium channel beta1 subunit, in 282 probands with Brugada syndrome and in 44 patients with conduction disease, none of whom had SCN5A mutations. We identified 3 mutations segregating with arrhythmia in 3 kindreds. Two of these mutations were located in a newly described alternately processed transcript, beta1B. Both the canonical and alternately processed transcripts were expressed in the human heart and were expressed to a greater degree in Purkinje fibers than in heart muscle, consistent with the clinical presentation of conduction disease. Sodium current was lower when NaV1.5 was coexpressed with mutant beta1 or beta1B subunits than when it was coexpressed with WT subunits. These findings implicate SCN1B as a disease gene for human arrhythmia susceptibility.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17185466,Natural history and early diagnosis of LAD-1/variant syndrome.,"The syndrome of leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) combined with a severe Glanzmann-type bleeding disorder has been recognized as a separate disease entity. The variability in clinical and cell biological terms has remained largely unclear. We present data on 9 cases from 7 unrelated families, with 3 patients being actively followed for more than 12 years. The disease entity, designated LAD-1/variant syndrome, presents early in life and consists of nonpussing infections from bacterial and fungal origin, as well as a severe bleeding tendency. This is compatible with 2 major blood cell types contributing to the clinical symptoms (ie, granulocytes and platelets). In granulocytes of the patients, we found adhesion and chemotaxis defects, as well as a defect in NADPH oxidase activity triggered by unopsonized zymosan. This last test can be used as a screening test for the syndrome. Many proteins and genes involved in adhesion and signaling, including small GTPases such as Rap1 and Rap2 as well as the major Rap activity-regulating molecules, were normally present. Moreover, Rap1 activation was intact in patients' blood cells. Defining the primary defect awaits genetic linkage analysis, which may be greatly helped by a more precise understanding and awareness of the disease combined with the early identification of affected patients.","clinical trial; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
9312170,Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD-1)/variant. A novel immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by dysfunctional beta2 integrins.,"Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is characterized by the inability of leukocytes, in particular neutrophilic granulocytes, to emigrate from the bloodstream towards sites of inflammation. Infectious foci are nonpurulent and may eventually become necrotic because of abnormal wound healing. LAD-1 is characterized by the absence of the beta2 integrins (CD11/CD18) on leukocytes. When expression is completely absent, patients often die within the first year. However, low levels of beta2 expression may result in a milder clinical picture of recurrent infection, which offers a better prognosis. In this paper, we describe the in vivo and in vitro findings on a patient with clinical features of a mild LAD-1 disorder, i.e., suffering from bacterial infections without apparent pus formation in the presence of a striking granulocytosis, showing no delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction upon skin testing, no specific antibody generation, but normal in vitro T cell proliferation responses after immunization. Expression levels of CD11/CD18 proteins were completely normal, but leukocyte activation did not result in CD11/ CD18 activation and high-avidity ligand-binding. In vitro chemotaxis and endothelial transmigration of the neutrophils as well as leukocyte aggregation responses were almost absent. On the other hand, beta1 and beta3 integrin-mediated adhesion functions were completely normal. During follow-up, a bleeding tendency related to decreased beta3 activation became clinically apparent, different from previously described cellular adhesion molecule variants. Therefore, this is the first well-documented case of a clinical combined immunodeficiency syndrome that results from nonfunctional CD11/CD18 molecules, and thus designated LAD-1/ variant.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
18984066,Clinical and genetic heterogeneity in keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans.,"Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans (KFSD) is an uncommon genodermatosis mainly characterized by follicular hyperkeratosis, progressive cicatricial alopecia and photophobia. Although an excess of affected males and linkage studies strongly suggest an X-linked pattern of inheritance, an apparently rarer autosomal dominant form with prominent follicular inflammation has also been postulated. We report on a three-generation family with five affected individuals and male-to-male transmission. In addition to widespread keratosis pilaris, cicatricial alopecia and eye involvement, our patients show diffuse facial erythema, recurrent folliculitis, enamel hypoplasia, and thickened nails. A literature review of the last 50 years identified 43 additional KFSD cases. X-linked inheritance is demonstrated in two pedigrees by linkage studies and suspected in five. An autosomal dominant pattern is confirmed in three families, including ours, by male-to-male transmission and considered likely in four. Marked facial erythema, extensive folliculitis, onychodystrophy and multiple caries are frequently reported in the autosomal dominant variant, while palmo-plantar keratoderma and early onset seem more typical of the X-linked form. Moreover, three sporadic male patients showing additional multisystemic abnormalities might be explained by an X-linked contiguous-gene syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
18678517,A missense variant in desmoglein-2 predisposes to dilated cardiomyopathy.,"Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy (FDCM) is caused by mutations in genes encoding myocardial force transduction proteins. Desmoglein-2 (DSG2) and Desmocollin-2 (DSC2) provide cellular adhesion and force transduction by cell-to-cell anchorage. To test whether perturbations of DSG2 or DSC2 exhibit a pathogenic impact on DCM pathogenesis, we sequenced both genes in 73 patients with FDCM and assessed prevalence of missense variations in matched control cohorts. We detected two missense variations in DSG2 (V55M and V919G) which were absent in 360 control alleles. Surprisingly, both variants were previously reported in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Yet, in the present study only the DSG2-V55M variant showed segregation with DCM in a family pedigree. Subsequent, analysis of 538 patients with idiopathic DCM and 617 consecutive control individuals resulted in identification of thirteen DSG2-V55M carriers with DCM, whereas only three control subjects harbored the variant. DSG2 immunostaining revealed pale structures of the intercalated disc in myocardium of one unique homozygous DSG2-V55M carrier. Furthermore, myocardial desmosomal structures were significantly shortened when compared to DCM myocardium negative for DSG2-V55M. Thus, our study identified the DSG2-V55M polymorphism as a novel risk variant for DCM associated with shortened desmosomes of the cardiac intercalated disc.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
25437880,Exome sequencing reveals MCM8 mutation underlies ovarian failure and chromosomal instability.,"Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder that includes individuals with manifestations ranging from primary amenorrhea to loss of menstrual function prior to age 40. POF presents as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and can be part of a syndrome or occur in isolation. Here, we studied 3 sisters with primary amenorrhea, hypothyroidism, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. The sisters were born to parents who are first cousins. SNP analysis and whole-exome sequencing revealed the presence of a pathogenic variant of the minichromosome maintenance 8 gene (MCM8, c.446C>G; p.P149R) located within a region of homozygosity that was present in the affected daughters but not in their unaffected sisters. Because MCM8 participates in homologous recombination and dsDNA break repair, we tested fibroblasts from the affected sisters for hypersensitivity to chromosomal breaks. Compared with fibroblasts from unaffected daughters, chromosomal break repair was deficient in fibroblasts from the affected individuals, likely due to inhibited recruitment of MCM8 p.P149R to sites of DNA damage. Our study identifies an autosomal recessive disorder caused by an MCM8 mutation that manifests with endocrine dysfunction and genomic instability.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
16301218,Deletion of the ANKRD15 gene at 9p24.3 causes parent-of-origin-dependent inheritance of familial cerebral palsy.,"A four-generation family was studied in which nine children had congenital cerebral palsy (CP), characterized by quadriplegia and mental retardation. All the affected children were born to healthy, related fathers, whereas the children of their healthy female relatives were unaffected. Linkage analysis attributed the condition to chromosome 9p24.3, where a 225 kb deletion was identified. The deletion spans a single gene, ANKRD15 (ankyrin repeat domain 15), which is ubiquitously expressed. In the affected children, the ANKRD15 is not expressed in lymphoblastoid cells, whereas in their healthy fathers, who harbor the same deletion, the expression of ANKRD15 did not deviate from controls. This expression pattern can be interpreted as a maternal imprinted gene that is expressed only from the paternal allele. The expression of ANKRD15 in lymphoblastoid cells from the control group was monoallelic but not imprinted. The monoallelic expression was restricted to the ANKRD15 gene, whereas biallelic expression was found in the DOCK8 gene, which resides at the telomeric side of the deletion. No correlation was found between the expression of the ANKRD15 gene and the pattern of DNA methylation in the CpG islands 5' of the gene. However, differences in methylation pattern were found in the CpG islands flanking the DMRT1 gene, which is located at the 3' side of the ANKRD15 gene. In the affected individuals, as in the control group, the CpG islands were hypo-methylated, whereas in the healthy fathers, the CpG islands were hyper-methylated in cis with the deletion. This unique family demonstrates a phenomenon of a deletion that creates imprinting-like inheritance. The implication of this family to sporadic CP is discussed.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19481195,The primordial growth disorder 3-M syndrome connects ubiquitination to the cytoskeletal adaptor OBSL1.,"3-M syndrome is an autosomal-recessive primordial growth disorder characterized by significant intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction. Mutations in the CUL7 gene are known to cause 3-M syndrome. In 3-M syndrome patients that do not carry CUL7 mutations, we performed high-density genome-wide SNP mapping to identify a second locus at 2q35-q36.1. Further haplotype analysis revealed a 1.29 Mb interval in which the underlying gene is located and we subsequently discovered seven distinct null mutations from 10 families within the gene OBSL1. OBSL1 is a putative cytoskeletal adaptor protein that localizes to the nuclear envelope. We were also able to demonstrate that loss of OBSL1 leads to downregulation of CUL7, implying a role for OBSL1 in the maintenance of CUL7 protein levels and suggesting that both proteins are involved within the same molecular pathway.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19576565,Deficiency of Dol-P-Man synthase subunit DPM3 bridges the congenital disorders of glycosylation with the dystroglycanopathies.,"Alpha-dystroglycanopathies such as Walker Warburg syndrome represent an important subgroup of the muscular dystrophies that have been related to defective O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. In many patients, the underlying genetic etiology remains unsolved. Isolated muscular dystrophy has not been described in the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) caused by N-linked protein glycosylation defects. Here, we present a genetic N-glycosylation disorder with muscular dystrophy in the group of CDG type I. Extensive biochemical investigations revealed a strongly reduced dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase activity. Sequencing of the three DPM subunits and complementation of DPM3-deficient CHO2.38 cells showed a pathogenic p.L85S missense mutation in the strongly conserved coiled-coil domain of DPM3 that tethers catalytic DPM1 to the ER membrane. Cotransfection experiments in CHO cells showed a reduced binding capacity of DPM3(L85S) for DPM1. Investigation of the four Dol-P-Man-dependent glycosylation pathways in the ER revealed strongly reduced O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan in a muscle biopsy, thereby explaining the clinical phenotype of muscular dystrophy. This mild Dol-P-Man biosynthesis defect due to DPM3 mutations is a cause for alpha-dystroglycanopathy, thereby bridging the congenital disorders of glycosylation with the dystroglycanopathies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18591664,Syntrophin mutation associated with long QT syndrome through activation of the nNOS-SCN5A macromolecular complex.,"Mutations in 11 genes that encode ion channels or their associated proteins cause inherited long QT syndrome (LQTS) and account for approximately 75-80% of cases (LQT1-11). Direct sequencing of SNTA1, the gene encoding alpha1-syntrophin, was performed in a cohort of LQTS patients that were negative for mutations in the 11 known LQTS-susceptibility genes. A missense mutation (A390V-SNTA1) was found in a patient with recurrent syncope and markedly prolonged QT interval (QTc, 530 ms). SNTA1 links neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to the nNOS inhibitor plasma membrane Ca-ATPase subtype 4b (PMCA4b); SNTA1 also is known to associate with the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A. By using a GST-fusion protein of the C terminus of SCN5A, we showed that WT-SNTA1 interacted with SCN5A, nNOS, and PMCA4b. In contrast, A390V-SNTA1 selectively disrupted association of PMCA4b with this complex and increased direct nitrosylation of SCN5A. A390V-SNTA1 expressed with SCN5A, nNOS, and PMCA4b in heterologous cells increased peak and late sodium current compared with WT-SNTA1, and the increase was partially inhibited by NOS blockers. Expression of A390V-SNTA1 in cardiac myocytes also increased late sodium current. We conclude that the A390V mutation disrupted binding with PMCA4b, released inhibition of nNOS, caused S-nitrosylation of SCN5A, and was associated with increased late sodium current, which is the characteristic biophysical dysfunction for sodium-channel-mediated LQTS (LQT3). These results establish an SNTA1-based nNOS complex attached to SCN5A as a key regulator of sodium current and suggest that SNTA1 be considered a rare LQTS-susceptibility gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
10220144,Novel KCNQ1 and HERG missense mutations in Dutch long-QT families.,"Congenital long QT syndrome (cLQTS) is electrocardiographically characterized by a prolonged QT interval and polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias (torsade de pointes). These cardiac arrhythmias may result in recurrent syncopes, seizure, or sudden death. LQTS can occur either as an autosomal dominant (Romano Ward) or as an autosomal recessive disorder (Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome). Mutations in at least five genes have been associated with the LQTS. Four genes, encoding cardiac ion channels, have been identified. The most common forms of LQTS are due to mutations in the potassium-channel genes KCNQ1 and HERG. We have screened 24 Dutch LQTS families for mutations in KCNQ1 and HERG. Fourteen missense mutations were identified. Eight of these missense mutations were novel: three in KCNQ1 and five in HERG. Novel missense mutations in KCNQ1 were Y184S, S373P, and W392R and novel missense mutations in HERG were A558P, R582C, G604S, T613M, and F640L. The KCNQ1 mutation G189R and the HERG mutation R582C were detected in two families. The pathogenicity of the mutations was based on segregation in families, absence in control individuals, the nature of the amino acid substitution, and localization in the protein. Genotype-phenotype studies indicated that auditory stimuli as trigger of cardiac events differentiate LQTS2 and LQTS1. In LQTS1, exercise was the predominant trigger. In addition, a number of asymptomatic gene defect carriers were identified. Asymptomatic carriers are still at risk of the development of life-threatening arrhythmias, underlining the importance of DNA analyses for unequivocal diagnosis of patients with LQTS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19589401,Multiple synostoses syndrome is due to a missense mutation in exon 2 of FGF9 gene.,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play diverse roles in several developmental processes. Mutations leading to deregulated FGF signaling can cause human skeletal dysplasias and cancer.(1,2) Here we report a missense mutation (Ser99Asp) in exon 2 of FGF9 in 12 patients with multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS) in a large Chinese family. In vitro studies demonstrate that FGF9(S99N) is expressed and secreted as efficiently as wild-type FGF9 in transfected cells. However, FGF9(S99N) induces compromised chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, which is accompanied by enhanced osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Biochemical analysis reveals that S99N mutation in FGF9 leads to significantly impaired FGF signaling, as evidenced by diminished activity of Erk1/2 pathway and decreased beta-catenin and c-Myc expression when compared with wild-type FGF9. Importantly, the binding of FGF9(S99N) to its receptor is severely impaired although the dimerization ability of mutant FGF9 itself or with wild-type FGF9 is not detectably affected, providing a basis for the defective FGFR signaling. Collectively, our data demonstrate a previously uncharacterized mutation in FGF9 as one of the causes of SYNS, implicating an important role of FGF9 in normal joint development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
19246354,Mutations in NR5A1 associated with ovarian insufficiency.,"The genetic causes of nonsyndromic ovarian insufficiency are largely unknown. A nuclear receptor, NR5A1 (also called steroidogenic factor 1), is a key transcriptional regulator of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-steroidogenic axis. Mutation of NR5A1 causes 46,XY disorders of sex development, with or without adrenal failure, but growing experimental evidence from studies in mice suggests a key role for this factor in ovarian development and function as well.To test the hypothesis that mutations in NR5A1 cause disorders of ovarian development and function, we sequenced NR5A1 in four families with histories of both 46,XY disorders of sex development and 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency and in 25 subjects with sporadic ovarian insufficiency. None of the affected subjects had clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency.Members of each of the four families and 2 of the 25 subjects with isolated ovarian insufficiency carried mutations in the NR5A1 gene. In-frame deletions and frameshift and missense mutations were detected. Functional studies indicated that these mutations substantially impaired NR5A1 transactivational activity. Mutations were associated with a range of ovarian anomalies, including 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis and 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency. We did not observe these mutations in more than 700 control alleles.NR5A1 mutations are associated with 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency and 46,XY disorders of sex development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Two case reports and a case series study have described the phenotype of 10 individuals with ZNF462 loss of function variants. Herein, we present 14 new individuals with loss of function variants to the previous studies to delineate the syndrome of loss of function in ZNF462. Collectively, these 24 individuals present with recurring phenotypes that define a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome. Most have some form of developmental delay (79%) and a minority has autism spectrum disorder (33%). Characteristic facial features include ptosis (83%), down slanting palpebral fissures (58%), exaggerated Cupid's bow/wide philtrum (54%), and arched eyebrows (50%). Metopic ridging or craniosynostosis was found in a third of study participants and feeding problems in half. Other phenotype characteristics include dysgenesis of the corpus callosum in 25% of individuals, hypotonia in half, and structural heart defects in 21%. Using facial analysis technology, a computer algorithm applying deep learning was able to accurately differentiate individuals with ZNF462 loss of function variants from individuals with Noonan syndrome and healthy controls. In summary, we describe a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome associated with haploinsufficiency of ZNF462 that has distinct clinical characteristics and facial features.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

19615667,Mutations in MMP9 and MMP13 determine the mode of inheritance and the clinical spectrum of metaphyseal anadysplasia.,"The matrix metalloproteinases MMP9 and MMP13 catalyze the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the growth plate and at the same time cleave and release biologically active molecules stored in the ECM, such as VEGFA. In mice, ablation of Mmp9, Mmp13, or both Mmp9 and Mmp13 causes severe distortion of the metaphyseal growth plate. We report that mutations in either MMP9 or MMP13 are responsible for the human disease metaphyseal anadysplasia (MAD), a heterogeneous group of disorders for which a milder recessive variant and a more severe dominant variant are known. We found that recessive MAD is caused by homozygous loss of function of either MMP9 or MMP13, whereas dominant MAD is associated with missense mutations in the prodomain of MMP13 that determine autoactivation of MMP13 and intracellular degradation of both MMP13 and MMP9, resulting in a double enzymatic deficiency.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Impaired miRNA target binding resulting from SNPs within mRNA target sites has been shown to lead to pathologies associated with dysregulated gene expression. However, no pathogenic mutations within the mature sequence of a miRNA have been reported so far. Here we show that point mutations in the seed region of miR-96, a miRNA expressed in hair cells of the inner ear, result in autosomal dominant, progressive hearing loss. This is the first study implicating a miRNA in a mendelian disorder. The identified mutations have a strong impact on miR-96 biogenesis and result in a significant reduction of mRNA targeting. We propose that these mutations alter the regulatory role of miR-96 in maintaining gene expression profiles in hair cells required for their normal function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19409522,The mitochondrial disulfide relay system protein GFER is mutated in autosomal-recessive myopathy with cataract and combined respiratory-chain deficiency.,"A disulfide relay system (DRS) was recently identified in the yeast mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) that consists of two essential components: the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 and the redox-regulated import receptor Mia40. The DRS drives the import of cysteine-rich proteins into the IMS via an oxidative folding mechanism. Erv1p is reoxidized within this system, transferring its electrons to molecular oxygen through interactions with cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase (COX), thereby linking the DRS to the respiratory chain. The role of the human Erv1 ortholog, GFER, in the DRS has been poorly explored. Using homozygosity mapping, we discovered that a mutation in the GFER gene causes an infantile mitochondrial disorder. Three children born to healthy consanguineous parents presented with progressive myopathy and partial combined respiratory-chain deficiency, congenital cataract, sensorineural hearing loss, and developmental delay. The consequences of the mutation at the level of the patient's muscle tissue and fibroblasts were 1) a reduction in complex I, II, and IV activity; 2) a lower cysteine-rich protein content; 3) abnormal ultrastructural morphology of the mitochondria, with enlargement of the IMS space; and 4) accelerated time-dependent accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions. Moreover, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae erv1(R182H) mutant strain reproduced the complex IV activity defect and exhibited genetic instability of the mtDNA and mitochondrial morphological defects. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis, establish the role of GFER in the human DRS, and promote an understanding of the pathogenesis of a new mitochondrial disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
19409520,Human RAD50 deficiency in a Nijmegen breakage syndrome-like disorder.,"The MRE11/RAD50/NBN (MRN) complex plays a key role in recognizing and signaling DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Hypomorphic mutations in NBN (previously known as NBS1) and MRE11A give rise to the autosomal-recessive diseases Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) and ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD), respectively. To date, no disease due to RAD50 deficiency has been described. Here, we report on a patient previously diagnosed as probably having NBS, with microcephaly, mental retardation, 'bird-like' face, and short stature. At variance with this diagnosis, she never had severe infections, had normal immunoglobulin levels, and did not develop lymphoid malignancy up to age 23 years. We found that she is compound heterozygous for mutations in the RAD50 gene that give rise to low levels of unstable RAD50 protein. Cells from the patient were characterized by chromosomal instability; radiosensitivity; failure to form DNA damage-induced MRN foci; and impaired radiation-induced activation of and downstream signaling through the ATM protein, which is defective in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia. These cells were also impaired in G1/S cell-cycle-checkpoint activation and displayed radioresistant DNA synthesis and G2-phase accumulation. The defective cellular phenotype was rescued by wild-type RAD50. In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a patient with a RAD50 deficiency that results in a clinical phenotype that can be classified as an NBS-like disorder (NBSLD).",research-article; journal article; case reports
19732867,"Mutations in LOXHD1, an evolutionarily conserved stereociliary protein, disrupt hair cell function in mice and cause progressive hearing loss in humans.","Hearing loss is the most common form of sensory impairment in humans and is frequently progressive in nature. Here we link a previously uncharacterized gene to hearing impairment in mice and humans. We show that hearing loss in the ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-induced samba mouse line is caused by a mutation in Loxhd1. LOXHD1 consists entirely of PLAT (polycystin/lipoxygenase/alpha-toxin) domains and is expressed along the membrane of mature hair cell stereocilia. Stereociliary development is unaffected in samba mice, but hair cell function is perturbed and hair cells eventually degenerate. Based on the studies in mice, we screened DNA from human families segregating deafness and identified a mutation in LOXHD1, which causes DFNB77, a progressive form of autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). LOXHD1, MYO3a, and PJVK are the only human genes to date linked to progressive ARNSHL. These three genes are required for hair cell function, suggesting that age-dependent hair cell failure is a common mechanism for progressive ARNSHL.",review-article; review; journal article
23456818,"Exome sequencing identifies DYNC2H1 mutations as a common cause of asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (Jeune syndrome) without major polydactyly, renal or retinal involvement.","BACKGROUND:Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) is a rare, often lethal, recessively inherited chondrodysplasia characterised by shortened ribs and long bones, sometimes accompanied by polydactyly, and renal, liver and retinal disease. Mutations in intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes cause JATD, including the IFT dynein-2 motor subunit gene DYNC2H1. Genetic heterogeneity and the large DYNC2H1 gene size have hindered JATD genetic diagnosis. AIMS AND METHODS:To determine the contribution to JATD we screened DYNC2H1 in 71 JATD patients JATD patients combining SNP mapping, Sanger sequencing and exome sequencing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:We detected 34 DYNC2H1 mutations in 29/71 (41%) patients from 19/57 families (33%), showing it as a major cause of JATD especially in Northern European patients. This included 13 early protein termination mutations (nonsense/frameshift, deletion, splice site) but no patients carried these in combination, suggesting the human phenotype is at least partly hypomorphic. In addition, 21 missense mutations were distributed across DYNC2H1 and these showed some clustering to functional domains, especially the ATP motor domain. DYNC2H1 patients largely lacked significant extra-skeletal involvement, demonstrating an important genotype-phenotype correlation in JATD. Significant variability exists in the course and severity of the thoracic phenotype, both between affected siblings with identical DYNC2H1 alleles and among individuals with different alleles, which suggests the DYNC2H1 phenotype might be subject to modifier alleles, non-genetic or epigenetic factors. Assessment of fibroblasts from patients showed accumulation of anterograde IFT proteins in the ciliary tips, confirming defects similar to patients with other retrograde IFT machinery mutations, which may be of undervalued potential for diagnostic purposes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
19129173,Incomplete penetrance and phenotypic variability characterize Gdf6-attributable oculo-skeletal phenotypes.,"Proteins of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family are known to have a role in ocular and skeletal development; however, because of their widespread expression and functional redundancy, less progress has been made identifying the roles of individual BMPs in human disease. We identified seven heterozygous mutations in growth differentiation factor 6 (GDF6), a member of the BMP family, in patients with both ocular and vertebral anomalies, characterized their effects with a SOX9-reporter assay and western analysis, and demonstrated comparable phenotypes in model organisms with reduced Gdf6 function. We observed a spectrum of ocular and skeletal anomalies in morphant zebrafish, the latter encompassing defective tail formation and altered expression of somite markers noggin1 and noggin2. Gdf6(+/-) mice exhibited variable ocular phenotypes compatible with phenotypes observed in patients and zebrafish. Key differences evident between patients and animal models included pleiotropic effects, variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. These data establish the important role of this determinant in ocular and vertebral development, demonstrate the complex genetic inheritance of these phenotypes, and further understanding of BMP function and its contributions to human disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19804848,Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5 (FHL-5) is caused by mutations in Munc18-2 and impaired binding to syntaxin 11.,"Rapid intracellular transport and secretion of cytotoxic granules through the immunological synapse requires a balanced interaction of several proteins. Disturbance of this highly regulated process underlies familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), a genetically heterogeneous autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by a severe hyperinflammatory phenotype. Here, we have assigned FHL-5 to a 1 Mb region on chromosome 19p by using high-resolution SNP genotyping in eight unrelated FHL patients from consanguineous families. Subsequently, we found nine different mutations, either truncating or missense, in STXBP2 in twelve patients from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Central Europe. STXBP2 encodes syntaxin binding protein 2 (Munc18-2), involved in the regulation of vesicle transport to the plasma membrane. We have identified syntaxin 11, a SNARE protein mutated in FHL-4, as an interaction partner of STXBP2. This interaction is eliminated by the missense mutations found in our FHL-5 patients, which leads to a decreased stability of both proteins, as shown in patient lymphocytes. Activity of natural killer and cytotoxic T cells was markedly reduced or absent, as determined by CD107 degranulation. Our findings thus identify a key role for STXBP2 in lytic granule exocytosis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

We describe a family in which four women who were affected by either recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis or onychomycosis had the early-stop-codon mutation Tyr238X in the beta-glucan receptor dectin-1. The mutated form of dectin-1 was poorly expressed, did not mediate beta-glucan binding, and led to defective production of cytokines (interleukin-17, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6) after stimulation with beta-glucan or Candida albicans. In contrast, fungal phagocytosis and fungal killing were normal in the patients, explaining why dectin-1 deficiency was not associated with invasive fungal infections and highlighting the specific role of dectin-1 in human mucosal antifungal defense.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
19122847,Functional effects of KCNE3 mutation and its role in the development of Brugada syndrome.,"The Brugada Syndrome (BrS), an inherited syndrome associated with a high incidence of sudden cardiac arrest, has been linked to mutations in four different genes leading to a loss of function in sodium and calcium channel activity. Although the transient outward current (I(to)) is thought to play a prominent role in the expression of the syndrome, mutations in I(to)-related genes have not been identified as yet.One hundred and five probands with BrS were screened for ion channel gene mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) electrophoresis and direct sequencing. A missense mutation (R99H) in KCNE3 (MiRP2) was detected in one proband. The R99H mutation was found 4/4 phenotype positive and 0/3 phenotype-negative family members. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were co-transfected using wild-type (WT) or mutant KCNE3 and either WT KCND3 or KCNQ1. Whole-cell patch clamp studies were performed after 48 hours. Interactions between Kv4.3 and KCNE3 were analyzed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments in human atrial samples. Co-transfection of R99H-KCNE3 with KCNQ1 produced no alteration in current magnitude or kinetics. However, co-transfection of R99H KCNE3 with KCND3 resulted in a significant increase in the I(to) intensity compared to WT KCNE3+KCND3. Using tissues isolated from left atrial appendages of human hearts, we also demonstrate that K(v)4.3 and KCNE3 can be co-immunoprecipitated.These results provide definitive evidence for a functional role of KCNE3 in the modulation of I(to) in the human heart and suggest that mutations in KCNE3 can underlie the development of BrS.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19165230,Role of HCN4 channel in preventing ventricular arrhythmia.,"Bradycardia is a trigger of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with arrhythmia including Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome. The HCN4 channel controls the heart rate, and its mutations predispose to inherited sick sinus syndrome and long QT syndrome associated with bradycardia. We found a 4 base-insertion at the splice donor site of the HCN4 gene in a patient with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, which was supposed to generate a truncated channel. To investigate the role of the HCN4 channel in ventricular arrhythmia, we introduced a ventricular action potential of I(f) channel produced by HCN4 in a computer simulation model and found that the I(f) channel generated a leaky outward current during the plateau phase of ventricular action potential. Currents through the I(f) channel were suggested to contribute to the shortening of the action potential duration and the prevention of early after-depolarization in bradycardia. These observations suggested that the HCN4 channel played a preventive role in triggering bradycardia-induced ventricular arrhythmias.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19696794,Central areolar choroidal dystrophy associated with inherited drusen in a multigeneration Tunisian family: exclusion of the PRPH2 gene and the 17p13 locus.,"Central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD) is a rare inherited disease, which causes progressive profound loss of vision in patients during their fourth decade. It is characterized by atrophy of retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors and choriocapillaris. The disease showed a genetic heterogeneity. Previously, mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene and a linkage to the CACD locus in the 17p13 region have been reported in CACD families. In this study, we report on a clinical and genetic investigation of CACD in a large Tunisian consanguineous family with 21 affected individuals in three living generations. CACD has been associated with drusen in some of them. Linkage analysis and mutational screening exclude linkage to the PRPH2/RDS gene and to the CACD locus. These data provide further evidence of the genetic heterogeneity of CACD.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
19853238,"Missense mutations in a retinal pigment epithelium protein, bestrophin-1, cause retinitis pigmentosa.","Bestrophin-1 is preferentially expressed at the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) of the retina. Mutations in the BEST1 gene cause the retinal dystrophies vitelliform macular dystrophy, autosomal-dominant vitreochoroidopathy, and autosomal-recessive bestrophinopathy. Here, we describe four missense mutations in bestrophin-1, three that we believe are previously unreported, in patients diagnosed with autosomal-dominant and -recessive forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The physiological function of bestrophin-1 remains poorly understood although its heterologous expression induces a Cl--specific current. We tested the effect of RP-causing variants on Cl- channel activity and cellular localization of bestrophin-1. Two (p.L140V and p.I205T) produced significantly decreased chloride-selective whole-cell currents in comparison to those of wild-type protein. In a model system of a polarized epithelium, two of three mutations (p.L140V and p.D228N) caused mislocalization of bestrophin-1 from the basolateral membrane to the cytoplasm. Mutations in bestrophin-1 are increasingly recognized as an important cause of inherited retinal dystrophy.",research-article; journal article
19896109,Mutations in TRPM1 are a common cause of complete congenital stationary night blindness.,"Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of retinal disorders characterized by nonprogressive impaired night vision and variable decreased visual acuity. We report here that six out of eight female probands with autosomal-recessive complete CSNB (cCSNB) had mutations in TRPM1, a retinal transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel gene. These data suggest that TRMP1 mutations are a major cause of autosomal-recessive CSNB in individuals of European ancestry. We localized TRPM1 in human retina to the ON bipolar cell dendrites in the outer plexifom layer. Our results suggest that in humans, TRPM1 is the channel gated by the mGluR6 (GRM6) signaling cascade, which results in the light-evoked response of ON bipolar cells. Finally, we showed that detailed electroretinography is an effective way to discriminate among patients with mutations in either TRPM1 or GRM6, another autosomal-recessive cCSNB disease gene. These results add to the growing importance of the diverse group of TRP channels in human disease and also provide new insights into retinal circuitry.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19896113,TRPM1 is mutated in patients with autosomal-recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness.,"Night vision requires signaling from rod photoreceptors to adjacent bipolar cells in the retina. Mutations in the genes NYX and GRM6, expressed in ON bipolar cells, lead to a disruption of the ON bipolar cell response. This dysfunction is present in patients with complete X-linked and autosomal-recessive congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) and can be assessed by standard full-field electroretinography (ERG), showing severely reduced rod b-wave amplitude and slightly altered cone responses. Although many cases of complete CSNB (cCSNB) are caused by mutations in NYX and GRM6, in approximately 60% of the patients the gene defect remains unknown. Animal models of human diseases are a good source for candidate genes, and we noted that a cCSNB phenotype present in homozygous Appaloosa horses is associated with downregulation of TRPM1. TRPM1, belonging to the family of transient receptor potential channels, is expressed in ON bipolar cells and therefore qualifies as an excellent candidate. Indeed, mutation analysis of 38 patients with CSNB identified ten unrelated cCSNB patients with 14 different mutations in this gene. The mutation spectrum comprises missense, splice-site, deletion, and nonsense mutations. We propose that the cCSNB phenotype in these patients is due to the absence of functional TRPM1 in retinal ON bipolar cells.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19878917,Recessive mutations of the gene TRPM1 abrogate ON bipolar cell function and cause complete congenital stationary night blindness in humans.,"Complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB) is associated with loss of function of rod and cone ON bipolar cells in the mammalian retina. In humans, mutations in NYX and GRM6 have been shown to cause the condition. Through the analysis of a consanguineous family and screening of nine additional pedigrees, we have identified three families with recessive mutations in the gene TRPM1 encoding transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 1, also known as melastatin. A number of other variants of unknown significance were found. All patients had myopia, reduced central vision, nystagmus, and electroretinographic evidence of ON bipolar cell dysfunction. None had abnormalities of skin pigmentation, although other skin conditions were reported. RNA derived from human retina and skin was analyzed and alternate 5' exons were determined. The most 5' exon is likely to harbor an initiation codon, and the protein sequence is highly conserved across vertebrate species. These findings suggest an important role of this specific cation channel for the normal function of ON bipolar cells in the human retina.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20023659,Mutations in the formin gene INF2 cause focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a pattern of kidney injury observed either as an idiopathic finding or as a consequence of underlying systemic conditions. Several genes have been identified that, when mutated, lead to inherited FSGS and/or the related nephrotic syndrome. These findings have accelerated the understanding of glomerular podocyte function and disease, motivating our search for additional FSGS genes. Using linkage analysis, we identified a locus for autosomal-dominant FSGS susceptibility on a region of chromosome 14q. By sequencing multiple genes in this region, we detected nine independent nonconservative missense mutations in INF2, which encodes a member of the formin family of actin-regulating proteins. These mutations, all within the diaphanous inhibitory domain of INF2, segregate with FSGS in 11 unrelated families and alter highly conserved amino acid residues. The observation that alterations in this podocyte-expressed formin cause FSGS emphasizes the importance of fine regulation of actin polymerization in podocyte function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18024964,SLC4A11 mutations in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy.,"The endothelial (posterior) corneal dystrophies, which result from primary endothelial dysfunction, include Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) and congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED). Mutations in SLC4A11 gene have been recently identified in patients with recessive CHED (CHED2). In this study, we show that heterozygous mutations in the SLC4A11 gene also cause late-onset FECD. Four heterozygous mutations [three missense mutations (E399K, G709E and T754M) and one deletion mutation (c.99-100delTC)] absent in ethnically matched controls were identified in a screen of 89 FECD patients. Missense mutations involved amino acid residues showing high interspecies conservation, indicating that mutations at these sites would be deleterious. Accordingly, immunoblot analysis, biochemical assay of cell surface localization and confocal immunolocalization showed that missense proteins encoded by the mutants were defective in localization to the cell surface. Our data suggests that SLC4A11 haploinsufficiency and gradual accumulation of the aberrant misfolded protein may play a role in FECD pathology and that reduced levels of SLC4A11 influence the long-term viability of the neural crest derived corneal endothelial cells.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
25007886,Biosynthetic and functional defects in newly identified SLC4A11 mutants and absence of COL8A2 mutations in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy.,"Late-onset Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) shows genetic heterogeneity. Identification of SLC4A11 as a candidate gene for congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy with similar corneal endothelial defects as FECD and reduced mRNA expression of SLC4A11 in the endothelium of FECD cases suggested that this gene may also be involved in pathogenesis of FECD. Mutations in SLC4A11 give rise to SLC4A11 protein marked by retention in the endoplasmic reticulum as a result of mis-folding. We screened 45 sporadic late-onset, 4 early-onset FECD patients and an early-onset autosomal dominant FECD family. We identified three previously unreported missense mutations: c.719G>C (p.W240S), c.1519G>A (p.V507I) and c.1304C>T (p.T434I) in unrelated individuals. These SLC4A11 mutants, expressed in HEK293 cells, had defects in either their cell surface expression or functional activity (rate of osmotically driven water flux). SLC4A11 mutations contribute to 11% (5/45) of sporadic late-onset FECD in the cohort studied. COL8A2, which causes some cases of early-onset FECD, was also screened in this cohort. No mutations were identified in COL8A2, in neither the late-onset cohort nor the early-onset family, suggesting genetic heterogeneity in this FECD family.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
24094747,Mutations in AGBL1 cause dominant late-onset Fuchs corneal dystrophy and alter protein-protein interaction with TCF4.,"Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FCD) is a hereditary dystrophy of the corneal endothelium and is responsible for majority of the corneal transplantation performed in the United States. Here, we describe three generations of a family with 12 individuals affected by late-onset FCD and in which three individuals are unaffected. Genome-wide mapping provided suggestive linkage at two loci on chromosomal arms 3p and 15q. Alleles at either locus alone were not sufficient to explain FCD; however, considered together, both loci could explain the disorder in this pedigree. Subsequent next-generation sequencing identified a nonsense mutation in AGBL1 in the 15q locus; this mutation would result in a premature termination of AGBL1. Consistent with a causal role for this transcript, further sequencing of our cohort of late-onset-FCD-affected individuals identified two cases harboring the same nonsense mutation and a further three unrelated individuals bearing a second missense allele. AGBL1 encodes a glutamate decarboxylase previously identified in serial analysis of gene expression of corneal endothelium, a finding confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Wild-type AGBL1 localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm; in sharp contrast, the truncated protein showed distinct nuclear localization. Finally, we show that AGBL1 interacts biochemically with the FCD-associated protein TCF4 and that the mutations found in our cohort of FCD individuals diminish this interaction. Taken together, our data identify a locus for FCD, extend the complex genetic architecture of the disorder, provide direct evidence for the involvement of TCF4 in FCD pathogenesis, and begin to explain how causal FCD mutations affect discrete biochemical complexes.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
20137778,Homozygosity mapping reveals mutations of GRXCR1 as a cause of autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment.,"We identified overlapping homozygous regions within the DFNB25 locus in two Dutch and ten Pakistani families with sensorineural autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (arNSHI). Only one of the families, W98-053, was not consanguineous, and its sibship pointed toward a reduced critical region of 0.9 Mb. This region contained the GRXCR1 gene, and the orthologous mouse gene was described to be mutated in the pirouette (pi) mutant with resulting hearing loss and circling behavior. Sequence analysis of the GRXCR1 gene in hearing-impaired family members revealed splice-site mutations in two Dutch families and a missense and nonsense mutation, respectively, in two Pakistani families. The splice-site mutations are predicted to cause frameshifts and premature stop codons. In family W98-053, this could be confirmed by cDNA analysis. GRXCR1 is predicted to contain a GRX-like domain. GRX domains are involved in reversible S-glutathionylation of proteins and thereby in the modulation of activity and/or localization of these proteins. The missense mutation is located in this domain, whereas the nonsense and splice-site mutations may result in complete or partial absence of the GRX-like domain or of the complete protein. Hearing loss in patients with GRXCR1 mutations is congenital and is moderate to profound. Progression of the hearing loss was observed in family W98-053. Vestibular dysfunction was observed in some but not all affected individuals. Quantitative analysis of GRXCR1 transcripts in fetal and adult human tissues revealed a preferential expression of the gene in fetal cochlea, which may explain the nonsyndromic nature of the hearing impairment.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18162506,"Insulin mutation screening in 1,044 patients with diabetes: mutations in the INS gene are a common cause of neonatal diabetes but a rare cause of diabetes diagnosed in childhood or adulthood.","OBJECTIVE: Insulin gene (INS) mutations have recently been described as a cause of permanent neonatal diabetes (PND). We aimed to determine the prevalence, genetics, and clinical phenotype of INS mutations in large cohorts of patients with neonatal diabetes and permanent diabetes diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The INS gene was sequenced in 285 patients with diabetes diagnosed before 2 years of age, 296 probands with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and 463 patients with young-onset type 2 diabetes (nonobese, diagnosed <45 years). None had a molecular genetic diagnosis of monogenic diabetes. RESULTS: We identified heterozygous INS mutations in 33 of 141 probands diagnosed at <6 months, 2 of 86 between 6 and 12 months, and none of 58 between 12 and 24 months of age. Three known mutations (A24D, F48C, and R89C) account for 46% of cases. There were six novel mutations: H29D, L35P, G84R, C96S, S101C, and Y103C. INS mutation carriers were all insulin treated from diagnosis and were diagnosed later than ATP-sensitive K(+) channel mutation carriers (11 vs. 8 weeks, P < 0.01). In 279 patients with PND, the frequency of KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS gene mutations was 31, 10, and 12%, respectively. A heterozygous R6C mutation cosegregated with diabetes in a MODY family and is probably pathogenic, but the L68M substitution identified in a patient with young-onset type 2 diabetes may be a rare nonfunctional variant. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that INS mutations are the second most common cause of PND and a rare cause of MODY. Insulin gene mutation screening is recommended for all diabetic patients diagnosed before 1 year of age.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

19888295,Five novel loci for inherited hearing loss mapped by SNP-based homozygosity profiles in Palestinian families.,"In communities with high rates of consanguinity and consequently high prevalence of recessive phenotypes, homozygosity mapping with SNP arrays is an effective approach for gene discovery. In 20 Palestinian kindreds with prelingual nonsyndromic hearing loss, we generated homozygosity profiles reflecting linkage to the phenotype. Family sizes ranged from small nuclear families with two affected children, one unaffected sibling, and parents to multigenerational kindreds with 12 affected relatives. By including unaffected parents and siblings and screening 250 K SNP arrays, even small nuclear families yielded informative profiles. In 14 families, we identified the allele responsible for hearing loss by screening a single candidate gene in the longest homozygous region. Novel alleles included missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations of CDH23, MYO7A, MYO15A, OTOF, PJVK, Pendrin/SLC26A4, TECTA, TMHS, and TMPRSS3, and a large genomic deletion of Otoancorin (OTOA). All point mutations were rare in the Palestinian population (zero carriers in 288 unrelated controls); the carrier frequency of the OTOA genomic deletion was 1%. In six families, we identified five genomic regions likely to harbor novel genes for human hearing loss on chromosomes 1p13.3 (DFNB82), 9p23-p21.2/p13.3-q21.13 (DFNB83), 12q14.3-q21.2 (DFNB84; two families), 14q23.1-q31.1, and 17p12-q11.2 (DFNB85).","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
20400964,Germline mutations in breast and ovarian cancer pedigrees establish RAD51C as a human cancer susceptibility gene.,"Germline mutations in a number of genes involved in the recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. RAD51C is essential for homologous recombination repair, and a biallelic missense mutation can cause a Fanconi anemia-like phenotype. In index cases from 1,100 German families with gynecological malignancies, we identified six monoallelic pathogenic mutations in RAD51C that confer an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer. These include two frameshift-causing insertions, two splice-site mutations and two nonfunctional missense mutations. The mutations were found exclusively within 480 pedigrees with the occurrence of both breast and ovarian tumors (BC/OC; 1.3%) and not in 620 pedigrees with breast cancer only or in 2,912 healthy German controls. These results provide the first unambiguous evidence of highly penetrant mutations associated with human cancer in a RAD51 paralog and support the 'common disease, rare allele' hypothesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19921647,Genotype-phenotype correlation in four 15q24 deleted patients identified by array-CGH.,"Microdeletion 15q24 is an emerging syndrome recently described, mainly due to increased use of array-CGH. Clinical features associate mild to moderate developmental delay, typical facial characteristics (high forehead and frontal hairline, broad eyebrows, downslanting palpebral features, long philtrum), hands (particularly proximal implanted thumbs) and genital anomalies (micropenis, hypospadias). We report here on four de novo cases having 2.5-6.1 Mb deletions involving 15q24: one 15q23q24.2 (Patient 1) and three 15q24.1q24.2 deletions (Patients 2-4). We correlate phenotype to genotype according to molecular boundaries of these deletions. Since bilateral iris coloboma and severe ano-rectal malformation were only present in Patient 1, we could link these anomalies to haploinsufficiency of 15q23 genes. Neither hypospadias nor micropenis were present in Patient 3 bearing the smallest deletion, therefore we could define 500 kb 15q24.1 region linked to these anomalies.",research-article; journal article; case reports
20678247,A large-scale survey of the novel 15q24 microdeletion syndrome in autism spectrum disorders identifies an atypical deletion that narrows the critical region.,"BACKGROUND: The 15q24 microdeletion syndrome has been recently described as a recurrent, submicroscopic genomic imbalance found in individuals with intellectual disability, typical facial appearance, hypotonia, and digital and genital abnormalities. Gene dosage abnormalities, including copy number variations (CNVs), have been identified in a significant fraction of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In this study we surveyed two ASD cohorts for 15q24 abnormalities to assess the frequency of genomic imbalances in this interval. METHODS: We screened 173 unrelated subjects with ASD from the Central Valley of Costa Rica and 1336 subjects with ASD from 785 independent families registered with the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) for CNVs across 15q24 using oligonucleotide arrays. Rearrangements were confirmed by array comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Among the patients from Costa Rica, an atypical de novo deletion of 3.06 Mb in 15q23-q24.1 was detected in a boy with autism sharing many features with the other 13 subjects with the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome described to date. He exhibited intellectual disability, constant smiling, characteristic facial features (high anterior hairline, broad medial eyebrows, epicanthal folds, hypertelorism, full lower lip and protuberant, posteriorly rotated ears), single palmar crease, toe syndactyly and congenital nystagmus. The deletion breakpoints are atypical and lie outside previously characterized low copy repeats (69,838-72,897 Mb). Genotyping data revealed that the deletion had occurred in the paternal chromosome. Among the AGRE families, no large 15q24 deletions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: From the current and previous studies, deletions in the 15q24 region represent rare causes of ASDs with an estimated frequency of 0.1 to 0.2% in individuals ascertained for ASDs, although the proportion might be higher in sporadic cases. These rates compare with a frequency of about 0.3% in patients ascertained for unexplained intellectual disability and congenital anomalies. This atypical deletion reduces the minimal interval for the syndrome from 1.75 Mb to 766 kb, implicating a reduced number of genes (15 versus 38). Sequencing of genes in the 15q24 interval in large ASD and intellectual disability samples may identify mutations of etiologic importance in the development of these disorders.",research-article; journal article
17070587,A novel homozygous GRK1 mutation (P391H) in 2 siblings with Oguchi disease with markedly reduced cone responses.,"PURPOSE: The only mutations reported to date in Japanese patients with Oguchi disease, a rare form of stationary night blindness with autosomal recessive transmission, have been in the SAG (arrestin) gene. The objective of this study was to describe the ophthalmic features and a novel mutation in the GRK1 (rhodopsin kinase) gene in 2 Japanese patients with Oguchi disease. DESIGN: Molecular genetic and observational case study. PARTICIPANTS: A consanguineous family including 2 siblings with Oguchi disease (a 35-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman). METHODS: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus examinations, Goldmann perimetry, color vision tests, and full-field electroretinograms (ERGs) were evaluated. Mutation screening of the SAG and GRK1 genes was performed with polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mutations in the GRK1 gene, BCVA, color vision, fundus photographs, visual fields, and ERG findings. RESULTS: Molecular analysis revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation (p.P391H) in the GRK1 gene in both patients. Proline 391 is not only within the functionally important catalytic domain, but is also a phylogenetically conserved amino acid residue among GRK1 orthologs and homologs. No mutation was found in the SAG gene. The unaffected parents were heterozygous carriers of the mutation. Both patients had night blindness, 1.5 BCVA for each eye, normal color vision, and typical fundus appearance with golden-yellow discoloration. The visual fields were normal in the male sibling. The ERGs showed no rod B waves, reduced standard combined responses, and markedly reduced single-flash cone and 30-Hz flicker responses in both patients. CONCLUSIONS: A novel homozygous GRK1 mutation (p.P391H) was found in 2 Japanese siblings with Oguchi disease. Visual function in the 2 patients has not deteriorated with age, indicating that the disease is stationary. This is the first report of any patient with GRK1-associated Oguchi disease with markedly reduced cone responses.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20398886,"Discovery and functional analysis of a retinitis pigmentosa gene, C2ORF71.","Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetically heterogeneous group of inherited ocular disorders characterized by progressive photoreceptor cell loss, night blindness, constriction of the visual field, and progressive visual disability. Homozygosity mapping and gene expression studies identified a 2 exon gene, C2ORF71. The encoded protein has no homologs and is highly expressed in the eye, where it is specifically expressed in photoreceptor cells. Two mutations were found in C2ORF71 in human RP patients: A nonsense mutation (p.W253X) in the first exon is likely to be a null allele; the second, a missense mutation (p.I201F) within a highly conserved region of the protein, leads to proteosomal degradation. Bioinformatic and functional studies identified and validated sites of lipid modification within the first three amino acids of the C2ORF71 protein. Using morpholino oligonucleotides to knockdown c2orf71 expression in zebrafish results in visual defects, confirming that C2ORF71 plays an important role in the development of normal vision. Finally, localization of C2ORF71 to primary cilia in cultured cells suggests that the protein is likely to localize to the connecting cilium or outer segment of photoreceptor cells.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
20398884,Mutations in C2ORF71 cause autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa.,"With a worldwide prevalence of 1 in 4,000, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common form of hereditary retinal degeneration. More than 30 genes and loci have been implicated in nonsyndromic autosomal-recessive (ar) RP. Genome-wide homozygosity mapping was conducted in one Dutch and one Israeli family affected by arRP. The families were found to share a 5.9 Mb homozygous region on chromosome 2p23.1-p23.3. A missense variant in one of the genes residing in this interval, C2ORF71, has recently been reported to be associated with RP. C2ORF71, encoding a putative protein of 1,288 amino acids, was found to be specifically expressed in human retina. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis revealed that in the mouse eye, C2orf71 is expressed as early as embryonic day 14. Mutation analysis detected a 1 bp deletion (c.946 del; p.Asn237MetfsX5) segregating with RP in the Dutch family, whereas a nonsense mutation (c.556C > T; p.Gln186X) was identified in the Israeli family. Microsatellite-marker analysis in additional Israeli families revealed cosegregation of a C2ORF71-linked haplotype in one other family, in which a 13 bp deletion (c.2756_2768 del; p.Lys919ThrfsX) was identified. Clinically, patients with mutations in C2ORF71 show signs of typical RP; these signs include poor night vision and peripheral field loss, typical retinal bone-spicule-type pigment deposits, pale appearance of the optic disk, and markedly reduced or completely extinguished electroretinograms. In conclusion, truncating mutations in C2ORF71 were identified in three unrelated families, thereby confirming the involvement of this gene in the etiology of arRP.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20428114,Mutations of optineurin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has its onset in middle age and is a progressive disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons of the primary motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Most cases of ALS are sporadic, but about 10% are familial. Genes known to cause classic familial ALS (FALS) are superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), ANG encoding angiogenin, TARDP encoding transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein TDP-43 (ref. 4) and fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS, also known as TLS). However, these genetic defects occur in only about 20-30% of cases of FALS, and most genes causing FALS are unknown. Here we show that there are mutations in the gene encoding optineurin (OPTN), earlier reported to be a causative gene of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), in patients with ALS. We found three types of mutation of OPTN: a homozygous deletion of exon 5, a homozygous Q398X nonsense mutation and a heterozygous E478G missense mutation within its ubiquitin-binding domain. Analysis of cell transfection showed that the nonsense and missense mutations of OPTN abolished the inhibition of activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and the E478G mutation revealed a cytoplasmic distribution different from that of the wild type or a POAG mutation. A case with the E478G mutation showed OPTN-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, TDP-43- or SOD1-positive inclusions of sporadic and SOD1 cases of ALS were also noticeably immunolabelled by anti-OPTN antibodies. Our findings strongly suggest that OPTN is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. They also indicate that NF-kappaB inhibitors could be used to treat ALS and that transgenic mice bearing various mutations of OPTN will be relevant in developing new drugs for this disorder.",research-article; journal article
4076245,"Generalised glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency causing haemolytic anaemia, neuromuscular symptoms and impairment of granulocytic function: a new syndrome due to a new stable GPI variant with diminished specific activity (GPI Homburg).","A new glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI) variant is described which is characterised by very low specific activity in erythrocytes, granulocytes and muscle tissue, nearly normal stability, normal kinetic properties and a decreased electrophoretic mobility. The propositus suffers from a complex syndrome involving erythrocytes (congenital haemolytic anaemia), granulocytes (decreased production of superoxide anion and reduced bactericidal activity in vitro) and the neuromuscular system (myopathy, mental retardation). It is suggested that the clinical syndrome results from generalised GPI deficiency due to a decreased specific activity of the variant enzyme, which cannot be compensated by an increase of de-novo synthesis of GPI protein even in cells exhibiting active protein synthesis such as granulocytes and muscle cells.",meta-analysis; research-article; journal article
8831086,Pulmonary function in children with homozygous alpha1-protease inhibitor deficiency.,"UNLABELLED:Alpha1-protease inhibitor (alpha1-PI) deficiency is a well-recognized cause of emphysema in adults; however, the natural history of this disorder in children is unclear. Because of the paucity of data in the paediatric age group, we performed whole body plethysmography, spirometry, and diffusing capacity, in a cohort of 17 homozygous (PiZZ phenotype) children (9 females, 8 males; mean age +/- SEM 13.4 +/- 0.9, range 7-18 years) and in 17 normal schoolchildren (13.5 +/- 0.9, 7-18 years), using a matched-pair design. Blood was drawn for determination of serum alpha1-PI levels, PI phenotype, and standard biochemical tests of liver function. Among the PiZZ subjects, 12 were detected during diagnostic workup of prolonged neonatal icterus, and 5 by routine testing in paediatric patients. None had chronic respiratory symptoms except for an 18-year-old PiZZ girl with a history of recent onset of exertional dyspnoea. All were non-smokers. The Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. As expected, serum alpha1-PI levels were lower in the PiZZ group (16% of the control value). A few patients had slight elevations of their liver enzymes. As for the pulmonary function parameters, differences between groups were not significant. Individual data showed no consistent abnormality in lung function except for signs of mild expiratory obstructive airway disease with hyperinflation (elevated TGV/TLC ratio) in the only symptomatic 18-year-old subject (0.63, control subject 0.49). This was unresponsive to bronchodilators. For her, augmentation therapy with intravenous infusion of alpha1-PI may be considered. CONCLUSION:Our study confirms the absence of pulmonary function abnormalities in the vast majority of children with homozygous alpha1-PI deficiency. Serial measurements of lung function may help to distinguish those individuals who require treatment with alpha1-PI from those who do not.",journal article

A cohort of PiZZ and PiSZ individuals was identified by the Swedish national neonatal AAT screening program in 1972-1974 and followed up regularly since birth. Our aim was to study the lung function, respiratory symptoms and health status at the age of 38 years in comparison with a random sample of control subjects selected from the population registry.The study group included 120 PiZZ, 46 PiSZ and 164 control subjects (PiMM), who answered a questionnaire on smoking habits and symptoms and the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) on quality of life. A total of 89 PiZZ, 33 PiSZ and 92 PiMM subjects underwent spirometry.Four percent of the PiZZ, 2% of the PiSZ and 12% of the control subjects were current smokers (P=0.008), and 17% of the PiZZ, 9% of the PiSZ and 21% of the control subjects had stopped smoking. The PiZZ current smokers had a significantly higher (ie, poorer) median activity score according to the SGRQ than the PiZZ never-smokers (P=0.032). The PiMM current smokers had significantly higher activity score (P<0.001), symptom score (P<0.001), and total score (P=0.001) according to the SGRQ than the PiMM never-smokers. The PiZZ current smokers had a significantly lower postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)% of predicted value (P=0.019) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio (P=0.032) than the PiZZ never-smokers. The proportion of subjects with a FEV1/FVC ratio of <0.70, indicating COPD, was significantly higher in the PiZZ current smokers than in the PiZZ never-smokers (P=0.001). Among the PiSZ and PiMM subjects, the differences in lung function between the smoking subgroups were insignificant.PiZZ current smokers were found to have signs of COPD before 40 years of age. Smoking is less common among the AAT-deficient subjects identified by neonatal screening than among their peers in the general population.",research-article; journal article
12672469,"Alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, liver disease and emphysema.","alpha(1)-Antitrypsin is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily and a potent inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. The most important deficiency variant of alpha(1)-antitrypsin arises from the Z mutation (Glu342Lys). This mutation perturbs the protein's tertiary structure to promote a precise, sequential intermolecular linkage that results in polymer formation. These polymers accumulate within the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocyte forming inclusion bodies that are associated with neonatal hepatitis, juvenile cirrhosis and adult hepatocellular carcinoma. The resultant secretory defect leads to plasma deficiency of alpha(1)-antitrypsin. This exposes lung tissue to uncontrolled proteolytic attack from neutrophil elastase, culminating in alveolar destruction. Thus, the Z alpha(1)-antitrypsin homozygote is predisposed to developing early onset basal, panacinar emphysema. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of the pathobiology of alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency and the associated liver cirrhosis and emphysema. We show how this knowledge has led to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat this condition.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
17164303,Variable phenotypes associated with aromatase (CYP19) insufficiency in humans.,"The P450 enzyme aromatase (CYP19) plays a crucial role in the endocrine and paracrine biosynthesis of estrogens from androgens in many diverse estrogen-responsive tissues. Complete aromatase deficiency has been reported in a small number of 46,XX girls with genital ambiguity and absent pubertal development, but it is unknown whether nonclassic phenotypes exist.The objective of this study was to determine whether variant forms of aromatase insufficiency can occur in humans.Four patients (46,XX) from three kindreds with variable degrees of androgenization and pubertal failure were studied using mutational analysis of CYP19 and assay of enzyme activity.Aromatase insufficiency resulting in genital ambiguity at birth, but with variable breast development at puberty (B2-B4), occurred in 46,XX patients from two kindreds who harbored point mutations or single codon deletions (R435C, F234del). Absent puberty with minimal androgenization at birth was found in one girl with a deletion involving exon 5 of CYP19 (exon5del), which would be predicted to lead to an in-frame deletion of 59 amino acids from the enzyme. Functional studies revealed low residual aromatase activity in the cases in which breast development occurred.These studies demonstrate that aromatase mutations can produce variable or ""nonclassic"" phenotypes in humans. Low residual aromatase activity may be sufficient for breast and uterine development to occur at puberty, despite significant androgenization in utero. Such phenotypic variability may be influenced further by modifying factors such as nonclassic pathways of estrogen synthesis, variability in coregulators, or differences in androgen responsiveness.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"

Most patients with 17,20-lyase deficiency have mutations in the domain of P450c17 that interact with the electron-donating redox partner, P450 oxidoreductase (POR).Our objective was to clarify the genetic and functional basis of isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency in familial cases who were previously reported as having 17,20-lyase deficiency.Four undervirilized males of an extended Bedouin family were investigated. One of these has previously been reported to carry mutations in the CYP17A1 gene encoding P450c17 causing isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency.Serum hormones were evaluated before and after stimulation with ACTH. Urinary steroid metabolites were profiled by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Exons 1 and 8 of CYP17A1 previously reported to harbor mutations in one of these patients and all 15 coding exons of POR were sequenced.Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) urinary steroid profiling and serum steroid measurements showed combined deficiencies of 17,20-lyase and 21-hydroxylase. Sequencing of exons 1 and 8 of CYP17A1 in two different laboratories showed no mutations. Sequencing of POR showed that all four patients were homozygous for G539R, a previously studied mutation that retains 46% of normal capacity to support the 17alpha-hydroxylase activity but only 8% of the 17,20-lyase activity of P450c17.POR deficiency can masquerade clinically as isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

20826268,Dominant mutations in RP1L1 are responsible for occult macular dystrophy.,"Occult macular dystrophy (OMD) is an inherited macular dystrophy characterized by progressive loss of macular function but normal ophthalmoscopic appearance. Typical OMD is characterized by a central cone dysfunction leading to a loss of vision despite normal ophthalmoscopic appearance, normal fluorescein angiography, and normal full-field electroretinogram (ERGs), but the amplitudes of the focal macular ERGs and multifocal ERGs are significantly reduced at the central retina. Linkage analysis of two OMD families was performed by the SNP High Throughput Linkage analysis system (SNP HiTLink), localizing the disease locus to chromosome 8p22-p23. Among the 128 genes in the linkage region, 22 genes were expressed in the retina, and four candidate genes were selected. No mutations were found in the first three candidate genes, methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA), GATA binding 4 (GATA4), and pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1). However, amino acid substitution of p.Arg45Trp in retinitis pigmentosa 1-like 1 (RP1L1) was found in three OMD families and p.Trp960Arg in a remaining OMD family. These two mutations were detected in all affected individuals but in none of the 876 controls. Immunohistochemistry of RP1L1 in the retina section of cynomolgus monkey revealed expression in the rod and cone photoreceptor, supporting a role of RP1L1 in the photoreceptors that, when disrupted by mutation, leads to OMD. Identification of RP1L1 mutations as causative for OMD has potentially broader implications for understanding the differential cone photoreceptor functions in the fovea and the peripheral retina.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20835237,Candidate exome capture identifies mutation of SDCCAG8 as the cause of a retinal-renal ciliopathy.,"Nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC) are recessive disorders that feature dysplasia or degeneration occurring preferentially in the kidney, retina and cerebellum. Here we combined homozygosity mapping with candidate gene analysis by performing 'ciliopathy candidate exome capture' followed by massively parallel sequencing. We identified 12 different truncating mutations of SDCCAG8 (serologically defined colon cancer antigen 8, also known as CCCAP) in 10 families affected by NPHP-RC. We show that SDCCAG8 is localized at both centrioles and interacts directly with OFD1 (oral-facial-digital syndrome 1), which is associated with NPHP-RC. Depletion of sdccag8 causes kidney cysts and a body axis defect in zebrafish and induces cell polarity defects in three-dimensional renal cell cultures. This work identifies loss of SDCCAG8 function as a cause of a retinal-renal ciliopathy and validates exome capture analysis for broadly heterogeneous single-gene disorders.",research-article; journal article
20797690,Mutations in DHDPSL are responsible for primary hyperoxaluria type III.,"Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is an autosomal-recessive disorder of endogenous oxalate synthesis characterized by accumulation of calcium oxalate primarily in the kidney. Deficiencies of alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) or glyoxylate reductase (GRHPR) are the two known causes of the disease (PH I and II, respectively). To determine the etiology of an as yet uncharacterized type of PH, we selected a cohort of 15 non-PH I/PH II patients from eight unrelated families with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis for high-density SNP microarray analysis. We determined that mutations in an uncharacterized gene, DHDPSL, on chromosome 10 cause a third type of PH (PH III). To overcome the difficulties in data analysis attributed to a state of compound heterozygosity, we developed a strategy of ""heterozygosity mapping""-a search for long heterozygous patterns unique to all patients in a given family and overlapping between families, followed by reconstruction of haplotypes. This approach enabled us to determine an allelic fragment shared by all patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and bearing a 3 bp deletion in DHDPSL. Overall, six mutations were detected: four missense mutations, one in-frame deletion, and one splice-site mutation. Our assumption is that DHDPSL is the gene encoding 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase, catalyzing the final step in the metabolic pathway of hydroxyproline.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
18391077,Genotype-phenotype correlation in combined deficiency of factor V and factor VIII.,"Combined deficiency of factor V and factor VIII (F5F8D) is caused by mutations in one of 2 genes, either LMAN1 or MCFD2. Here we report the identification of mutations for 11 additional F5F8D families, including 4 novel mutations, 2 in MCFD2 and 2 in LMAN1. We show that a novel MCFD2 missense mutation identified here (D81Y) and 2 previously reported mutations (D89A and D122V) abolish MCFD2 binding to LMAN1. Measurement of platelet factor V (FV) levels in 7 F5F8D patients (4 with LMAN1 and 3 with MCFD2 mutations) demonstrated similar reductions to those observed for plasma FV. Combining the current data together with all previous published reports, we performed a genotype-phenotype analysis comparing patients with MCFD2 mutations with those with LMAN1 mutations. A previously unappreciated difference is observed between these 2 classes of patients in the distribution of plasma levels for FV and factor VIII (FVIII). Although there is considerable overlap, the mean levels of plasma FV and FVIII in patients with MCFD2 mutations are significantly lower than the corresponding levels in patients with LMAN1 mutations. No differences in distribution of factor levels are observed by sex. These data suggest that MCFD2 may play a primary role in the export of FV and FVIII from the ER, with the impact of LMAN1 mediated indirectly through its interaction with MCFD2.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

20613546,A novel microdeletion/microduplication syndrome of 19p13.13.,"PURPOSE: Whole genome interrogation by array-based comparative genomic hybridization has led to a rapidly increasing number of discoveries of novel microdeletion and/or microduplication syndromes. We here describe the clinical and cytogenomic correlates of a novel microdeletion/microduplication of 19p13.13. METHODS: Among patients referred to the Cytogenetics laboratory for array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis, we identified four with a deletion and one with a duplication within 19p13.13. Confirmatory fluorescence in situ hybridization and parental studies were performed. Detailed clinical findings and array profiles were reviewed and compared. RESULTS: Patients with deletions of 19p13.13 share a unique constellation of phenotypic abnormalities. In addition to developmental disabilities, the microdeletion manifested in overgrowth, macrocephaly, and ophthalmologic and gastrointestinal findings; in contrast, the single microduplication manifested in growth delay and microcephaly. CONCLUSION: The consistent constellation of clinical findings associated with copy number variation of this region warrants the designation of microdeletion/microduplication syndrome of 19p13.13. An approximately 311-340 Kb smallest region of overlap encompassing 16 genes was identified. Candidate genes include MAST1, NFIX, and CALR. Identification of this syndrome has led to recommendations for diagnostic work-up and follow-up of patients with this copy number variant. Integration of detailed clinical and array data is critical for advancing both patient care and human genomic research.",journal article; case reports

20871611,A dominant-negative mutation in the TRESK potassium channel is linked to familial migraine with aura.,"Migraine with aura is a common, debilitating, recurrent headache disorder associated with transient and reversible focal neurological symptoms. A role has been suggested for the two-pore domain (K2P) potassium channel, TWIK-related spinal cord potassium channel (TRESK, encoded by KCNK18), in pain pathways and general anaesthesia. We therefore examined whether TRESK is involved in migraine by screening the KCNK18 gene in subjects diagnosed with migraine. Here we report a frameshift mutation, F139WfsX24, which segregates perfectly with typical migraine with aura in a large pedigree. We also identified prominent TRESK expression in migraine-salient areas such as the trigeminal ganglion. Functional characterization of this mutation demonstrates that it causes a complete loss of TRESK function and that the mutant subunit suppresses wild-type channel function through a dominant-negative effect, thus explaining the dominant penetrance of this allele. These results therefore support a role for TRESK in the pathogenesis of typical migraine with aura and further support the role of this channel as a potential therapeutic target.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20847235,IDH2 mutations in patients with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.,"Heterozygous somatic mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 and -2 (IDH1 and IDH2) were recently discovered in human neoplastic disorders. These mutations disable the enzymes' normal ability to convert isocitrate to 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG) and confer on the enzymes a new function: the ability to convert 2-KG to d-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG). We have detected heterozygous germline mutations in IDH2 that alter enzyme residue Arg(140) in 15 unrelated patients with d-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA), a rare neurometabolic disorder characterized by supraphysiological levels of D-2-HG. These findings provide additional impetus for investigating the role of D-2-HG in the pathophysiology of metabolic disease and cancer.",journal article
29979980,Bi-allelic Mutations in Phe-tRNA Synthetase Associated with a Multi-system Pulmonary Disease Support Non-translational Function.,"The tRNA synthetases catalyze the first step of protein synthesis and have increasingly been studied for their nuclear and extra-cellular ex-translational activities. Human genetic conditions such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth have been attributed to dominant gain-of-function mutations in some tRNA synthetases. Unlike dominantly inherited gain-of-function mutations, recessive loss-of-function mutations can potentially elucidate ex-translational activities. We present here five individuals from four families with a multi-system disease associated with bi-allelic mutations in FARSB that encodes the beta chain of the alpha2beta2 phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase (FARS). Collectively, the mutant alleles encompass a 5'-splice junction non-coding variant (SJV) and six missense variants, one of which is shared by unrelated individuals. The clinical condition is characterized by interstitial lung disease, cerebral aneurysms and brain calcifications, and cirrhosis. For the SJV, we confirmed exon skipping leading to a frameshift associated with noncatalytic activity. While the bi-allelic combination of the SJV with a p.Arg305Gln missense mutation in two individuals led to severe disease, cells from neither the asymptomatic heterozygous carriers nor the compound heterozygous affected individual had any defect in protein synthesis. These results support a disease mechanism independent of tRNA synthetase activities in protein translation and suggest that this FARS activity is essential for normal function in multiple organs.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19161147,"Recessive developmental delay, small stature, microcephaly and brain calcifications with locus on chromosome 2.","Two interrelated Omani families are described with eight children manifesting a genetic disorder with widespread brain calcifications. Brain imaging showed extensive scattered calcifications of basal ganglia and cortex, suggesting possible Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) or Coats' Plus syndrome. However, the clinical features in the present families diverge substantially from these two conditions. Growth delay, mild developmental delay, and poor school performance were present in all affected individuals, but progressive deterioration of neurological function was not apparent, nor were there significant cortical whitematter disease or retinopathy. Genome-wide linkage and fine-mapping analyses of the extended family members and affected individuals indicate a genetic locus for this disorder on Chromosome 2 with a LOD score of 6.17. The Chromosome 2 locus is novel and the clinical presentation displays features distinguishing the condition from either Coats' or AGS, making this a new variant or possibly a new disorder of inherited brain calcification.",research-article; journal article
20543202,Clinical characterisation of 29 neurofibromatosis type-1 patients with molecularly ascertained 1.4 Mb type-1 NF1 deletions.,"BACKGROUND: Large deletions of the NF1 gene region occur in approximately 5% of patients with neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) and are associated with particularly severe manifestations of the disease. However, until now, the genotype-phenotype relationship has not been comprehensively studied in patients harbouring large NF1 gene deletions of comparable extent (giving rise to haploinsufficiency of the same genes). METHOD: We have performed the most comprehensive clinical/neuropsychological characterisation so far undertaken in NF1 deletion patients, involving 29 patients with precisely determined type-1 NF1 (1.4 Mb) deletions. RESULTS: Novel clinical features found to be associated with type-1 NF1 deletions included pes cavus (17% of patients), bone cysts (50%), attention deficit (73%), muscular hypotonia (45%) and speech difficulties (48%). Type-1 NF1 deletions were found to be disproportionately associated with facial dysmorphic features (90% of patients), tall stature (46%), large hands and feet (46%), scoliosis (43%), joint hyperflexibility (72%), delayed cognitive development and/or learning disabilities (93%) and mental retardation (IQ<70; 38%), as compared with the general NF1 patient population. Significantly increased frequencies (relative to the general NF1 population) of plexiform neurofibromas (76%), subcutaneous neurofibromas (76%), spinal neurofibromas (64%) and MPNSTs (21%) were also noted in the type-1 deletion patients. Further, 50% of the adult patients exhibited a very high burden of cutaneous neurofibromas (N>or=1000). CONCLUSION: These findings emphasise the importance of deletion analysis in NF1 since frequent monitoring of tumour presence and growth could potentiate early surgical intervention thereby improving patient survival.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
7740448,Homozygosity for a novel missense mutation in the prothrombin gene causing a severe bleeding disorder.,"A patient with a severe bleeding tendency and hypoprothrombinemia (Factor II activity 2%, Factor II antigen 5%) was screened for the presence of alterations in his prothrombin gene. Direct sequencing of PCR fragments derived from the coding and flanking regions of the prothrombin gene, revealed that the patient was homozygous for an A-->G substitution in exon 3. This substitution predicts the replacement of Tyr44 (TAC) by Cys (TGC) in the prothrombin molecule. Both parents were found to be heterozygous for the same mutation. Further family studies revealed complete cosegregation of the mutation with the prothrombin deficiency. Only the five homozygous brothers and sisters of the propositus were clinically affected (severe hemorrhages including epistaxis, soft tissue, muscle and joint bleedings in all, and severe hemorrhages in the two women). The bleeding tendency therefore seems to inherit as an autosomal recessive trait.",journal article
19864492,Mutation of the bone morphogenetic protein GDF3 causes ocular and skeletal anomalies.,"Ocular mal-development results in heterogeneous and frequently visually disabling phenotypes that include coloboma and microphthalmia. Due to the contribution of bone morphogenetic proteins to such processes, the function of the paralogue Growth Differentiation Factor 3 was investigated. Multiple mis-sense variants were identified in patients with ocular and/or skeletal (Klippel-Feil) anomalies including one individual with heterozygous alterations in GDF3 and GDF6. These variants were characterized, individually and in combination, through integrated biochemical and zebrafish model organism analyses, demonstrating appreciable effects with western blot analyses, luciferase based reporter assays and antisense morpholino inhibition. Notably, inhibition of the zebrafish co-orthologue of GDF3 accurately recapitulates patient phenotypes. By demonstrating the pleiotropic effects of GDF3 mutation, these results extend the contribution of perturbed BMP signaling to human disease and potentially implicate multi-allelic inheritance of BMP variants in developmental disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20929727,Gamma-secretase gene mutations in familial acne inversa.,"Acne inversa (AI), also known as hidradenitis suppurativa, is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory disease of hair follicles that often runs in families. We studied six Chinese families with features of AI as well as additional skin lesions on back, face, nape, and waist and found independent loss-of-function mutations in PSENEN, PSEN1, or NCSTN, the genes encoding essential components of the γ-secretase multiprotein complex. Our results identify the γ-secretase component genes as the culprits for a subset of familial AI, implicate the γ-secretase-Notch pathway in the molecular pathogenesis of AI, and demonstrate that familial AI can be an allelic disorder of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.",journal article
7479749,Mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the rod cGMP-gated channel in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.,"Mutations in the genes encoding two proteins of the retinal rod phototransduction cascade, opsin and the beta subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase, cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in some families. Here we report defects in a third member of this biochemical pathway in still other patients with this disease. We screened 94 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant RP and 173 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive RP for mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel. Five mutant sequences cosegregated with disease among four unrelated families with autosomal recessive RP. Two of these were nonsense mutations early in the reading frame (Glu76End and Lys139End) and one was a deletion encompassing most if not all of the transcriptional unit; these three alleles would not be expected to encode a functional channel. The remaining two mutations were a missense mutation (Ser316Phe) and a frameshift [Arg654(1-bp del)] mutation truncating the last 32 aa in the C terminus. The latter two mutations were expressed in vitro and found to encode proteins that were predominantly retained inside the cell instead of being targeted to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the absence or paucity of functional cGMP-gated cation channels in the plasma membrane is deleterious to rod photoreceptors and is an uncommon cause of RP.",research-article; journal article
15570217,Autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in a Pakistani family mapped to CNGA1 with identification of a novel mutation.,"PURPOSE: To map the locus for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in a large Pakistani family and to determine the causative mutation. METHODS: A large family with multiple individuals affected by autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa was ascertained in the Punjab province of Pakistan as part of an ongoing project between the CEMB, Lahore, Pakistan and the NEI to identify genetic causes of eye diseases. After initial analysis of previously identified autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa loci, a genome wide scan was performed using microsatellite markers at about 10 cM intervals. Two point lod scores were calculated and haplotypes were analyzed in order to define disease locus. Bidirectional dideoxynucleotide sequencing was used to screen for mutations in candidate genes. RESULTS: In the genome wide scan, autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in this Pakistani family showed linkage to an 11.7 cM region of chromosome 4p12 between D4S405 and D4S1592 with a maximum lod score of 2.90 with D4S405 at theta;=0.01 Sequence analysis of CNGA1 identified a 2 bp deletion in exon 8: c.626_627delTA resulting in a frameshift, p.Ser209fsX26 in the translated protein. This mutation results in deletion of the COOH terminal 482 of 690 total amino acids in CNGA1 and their replacement by 25 novel amino acids before a premature termination. The mutation is found in a homozygous state in all 7 affected individuals and was heterozygous in all 15 unaffected family members examined. The mutant allele of CNGA1 itself shows linkage to the disease with maximum lod score of 4.43 at theta;=0. CONCLUSIONS: The autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in this family is caused by a mutation in CNGA1 gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which both linkage analysis and identification of a mutation support CNGA1 as a cause for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
9565049,Arrestin gene mutations in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and molecular genetic studies of patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa associated with a mutation in the arrestin gene. DESIGN: Results of molecular genetic screening and case reports with DNA analysis and clinical features. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty anamnestically unrelated patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. METHODS: DNA analysis was performed by single strand conformation polymorphism followed by nucleotide sequencing to search for a mutation in exon 11 of the arrestin gene. Clinical features were characterized by visual acuity slitlamp biomicroscopy, fundus examinations, fluorescein angiography, kinetic visual field testing, and electroretinography. RESULTS: We identified 3 unrelated patients with retinitis pigmentosa associated with a homozygous 1-base-pair deletion mutation in codon 309 of the arrestin gene designated as 1147delA. All 3 patients showed pigmentary retinal degeneration in the midperipheral area with or without macular involvement. Patient 1 had a sibling with Oguchi disease associated with the same mutation. Patient 2 demonstrated pigmentary retinal degeneration associated with a golden-yellow reflex in the peripheral fundus. Patients 1 and 3 showed features of retinitis pigmentosa without the golden-yellow fundus reflex. CONCLUSIONS: Although the arrestin 1147delA has been known as a frequent cause of Oguchi disease, this mutation also may be related to the pathogenesis of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. This phenomenon may provide evidence of variable expressivity of the mutation in the arrestin gene.",research-article; journal article
21217753,Mutations in SMAD3 cause a syndromic form of aortic aneurysms and dissections with early-onset osteoarthritis.,"Thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections are a main feature of connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. We delineated a new syndrome presenting with aneurysms, dissections and tortuosity throughout the arterial tree in association with mild craniofacial features and skeletal and cutaneous anomalies. In contrast with other aneurysm syndromes, most of these affected individuals presented with early-onset osteoarthritis. We mapped the genetic locus to chromosome 15q22.2-24.2 and show that the disease is caused by mutations in SMAD3. This gene encodes a member of the TGF-β pathway that is essential for TGF-β signal transmission. SMAD3 mutations lead to increased aortic expression of several key players in the TGF-β pathway, including SMAD3. Molecular diagnosis will allow early and reliable identification of cases and relatives at risk for major cardiovascular complications. Our findings endorse the TGF-β pathway as the primary pharmacological target for the development of new treatments for aortic aneurysms and osteoarthritis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29392890,A mutation update on the LDS-associated genes TGFB2/3 and SMAD2/3.,"The Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a connective tissue disorder affecting the cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular system. Most typically, LDS patients present with aortic aneurysms and arterial tortuosity, hypertelorism, and bifid/broad uvula or cleft palate. Initially, mutations in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2) were described to cause LDS, hereby leading to impaired TGF-β signaling. More recently, TGF-β ligands, TGFB2 and TGFB3, as well as intracellular downstream effectors of the TGF-β pathway, SMAD2 and SMAD3, were shown to be involved in LDS. This emphasizes the role of disturbed TGF-β signaling in LDS pathogenesis. Since most literature so far has focused on TGFBR1/2, we provide a comprehensive review on the known and some novel TGFB2/3 and SMAD2/3 mutations. For TGFB2 and SMAD3, the clinical manifestations, both of the patients previously described in the literature and our newly reported patients, are summarized in detail. This clearly indicates that LDS concerns a disorder with a broad phenotypical spectrum that is still emerging as more patients will be identified. All mutations described here are present in the corresponding Leiden Open Variant Database.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
21131974,The coiled-coil domain containing protein CCDC40 is essential for motile cilia function and left-right axis formation.,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent infections of the respiratory tract associated with the abnormal function of motile cilia. Approximately half of individuals with PCD also have alterations in the left-right organization of their internal organ positioning, including situs inversus and situs ambiguous (Kartagener's syndrome). Here, we identify an uncharacterized coiled-coil domain containing a protein, CCDC40, essential for correct left-right patterning in mouse, zebrafish and human. In mouse and zebrafish, Ccdc40 is expressed in tissues that contain motile cilia, and mutations in Ccdc40 result in cilia with reduced ranges of motility. We further show that CCDC40 mutations in humans result in a variant of PCD characterized by misplacement of the central pair of microtubules and defective assembly of inner dynein arms and dynein regulatory complexes. CCDC40 localizes to motile cilia and the apical cytoplasm and is required for axonemal recruitment of CCDC39, disruption of which underlies a similar variant of PCD.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
10775529,Missense mutation in the USH2A gene: association with recessive retinitis pigmentosa without hearing loss.,"Microdeletions Glu767(1-bp del), Thr967(1-bp del), and Leu1446(2-bp del) in the human USH2A gene have been reported to cause Usher syndrome type II, a disorder characterized by retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and mild-to-severe hearing loss. Each of these three frameshift mutations is predicted to lead to an unstable mRNA transcript that, if translated, would result in a truncated protein lacking the carboxy terminus. Here, we report Cys759Phe, a novel missense mutation in this gene that changes an amino-acid residue within the fifth laminin-epidermal growth factor-like domain of the USH2A gene and that is associated with recessive RP without hearing loss. This single mutation was found in 4.5% of 224 patients with recessive RP, suggesting that USH2A could cause more cases of nonsyndromic recessive RP than does any other gene identified to date.",research-article; journal article
21258341,TTC21B contributes both causal and modifying alleles across the ciliopathy spectrum.,"Ciliary dysfunction leads to a broad range of overlapping phenotypes, collectively termed ciliopathies. This grouping is underscored by genetic overlap, where causal genes can also contribute modifier alleles to clinically distinct disorders. Here we show that mutations in TTC21B, which encodes the retrograde intraflagellar transport protein IFT139, cause both isolated nephronophthisis and syndromic Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy. Moreover, although resequencing of TTC21B in a large, clinically diverse ciliopathy cohort and matched controls showed a similar frequency of rare changes, in vivo and in vitro evaluations showed a significant enrichment of pathogenic alleles in cases (P < 0.003), suggesting that TTC21B contributes pathogenic alleles to ∼5% of ciliopathy cases. Our data illustrate how genetic lesions can be both causally associated with diverse ciliopathies and interact in trans with other disease-causing genes and highlight how saturated resequencing followed by functional analysis of all variants informs the genetic architecture of inherited disorders.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

18199800,NEK8 mutations affect ciliary and centrosomal localization and may cause nephronophthisis.,"Nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive kidney disease, is the most frequent genetic cause of chronic renal failure in the first 3 decades of life. Causative mutations in 8 genes (NPHP1-8) have been identified, and homologous mouse models for NPHP2/INVS and NPHP3 have been described. The jck mouse is another model of recessive cystic kidney disease, and this mouse harbors a missense mutation, G448V, in the highly conserved RCC1 domain of Nek8. We hypothesized that mutations in NEK8 might cause nephronophthisis in humans, so we performed mutational analysis in a worldwide cohort of 588 patients. We identified 3 different amino acid changes that were conserved through evolution (L330F, H425Y, and A497P) and that were absent from at least 80 ethnically matched controls. All 3 mutations were within RCC1 domains, and the mutation H425Y was positioned within the same RCC1 repeat as the mouse jck mutation. To test the functional significance of these mutations, we introduced them into full-length mouse Nek8 GFP-tagged cDNA constructs. We transiently overexpressed the constructs in inner medullary collecting duct cells (IMCD-3 cell line) and compared the subcellular localization of mutant Nek8 to wild-type Nek8. All mutant forms of Nek8 showed defects in ciliary localization to varying degrees; the H431Y mutant (human H425Y) was completely absent from cilia and the amount localized to centrosomes was decreased. Overexpression of these mutants did not affect overall ciliogenesis, mitosis, or centriole number. Our genetic and functional data support the assumption that mutations in NEK8 cause nephronophthisis (NPHP9), adding another link between proteins mutated in cystic kidney disease and their localization to cilia and centrosomes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article"
15452722,Mutations in the gene coding for guanylate cyclase-activating protein 2 (GUCA1B gene) in patients with autosomal dominant retinal dystrophies.,"We investigated mutations in the gene coding for guanylate-cyclase activating protein 2 (GCAP2), also known as GUCA1B gene, in Japanese patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and tried to identify phenotypic characteristics associated with mutations in the gene.Genomic DNA samples from 63 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) and 33 patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP) were screened by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis followed by direct sequencing. Clinical features associated with a mutation were demonstrated by visual acuity, visual field testing, fundus photography, and electroretinography.A novel transitional mutation converting GGA to AGA at codon 157 (G157R) was identified. This mutation has been found in three index patients from three independent families. Phenotypic examination of seven members of the three families revealed that this mutation was associated with RP with or without macular involvement in five members, macular degeneration in one member, and asymptomatic normal phenotype in one member. In addition, previously unknown polymorphic changes including V29V, Y57Y, T87I, and L180L were identified.A racial difference exists in the spectrum of mutations and/or polymorphisms in the GCAP 2 gene between British and Japanese populations. Our findings suggest that the mutation in the GCAP 2 gene can cause one form of autosomal dominant retinal dystrophy, with variable phenotypic expression and incomplete penetrance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16384941,Spectrum and frequency of mutations in IMPDH1 associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and leber congenital amaurosis.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and spectrum of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase type I (IMPDH1) mutations associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), to determine whether mutations in IMPDH1 cause other forms of inherited retinal degeneration, and to analyze IMPDH1 mutations for alterations in enzyme activity and nucleic acid binding.The coding sequence and flanking intron/exon junctions of IMPDH1 were analyzed in 203 patients with autosomal dominant RP (adRP), 55 patients with autosomal recessive RP (arRP), 7 patients with isolated RP, 17 patients with macular degeneration (MD), and 24 patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). DNA samples were tested for mutations by sequencing only or by a combination of single-stranded conformational analysis and by sequencing. Production of fluorescent reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was used to measure enzymatic activity of mutant IMPDH1 proteins. The affinity and the specificity of mutant IMPDH1 proteins for single-stranded nucleic acids were determined by filter-binding assays.Five different IMPDH1 variants, Thr116Met, Asp226Asn, Val268Ile, Gly324Asp, and His 372Pro, were identified in eight autosomal dominant RP families. Two additional IMPDH1 variants, Arg105Trp and Asn198Lys, were found in two patients with isolated LCA. None of the novel IMPDH1 mutants identified in this study altered the enzymatic activity of the corresponding proteins. In contrast, the affinity and/or the specificity of single-stranded nucleic acid binding were altered for each IMPDH1 mutant except the Gly324Asp variant.Mutations in IMPDH1 account for approximately 2% of families with adRP, and de novo IMPDH1 mutations are also rare causes of isolated LCA. This analysis of the novel IMPDH1 mutants substantiates previous reports that IMPDH1 mutations do not alter enzyme activity and demonstrates that these mutants alter the recently identified single-stranded nucleic acid binding property of IMPDH. Studies are needed to further characterize the functional significance of IMPDH1 nucleic acid binding and its potential relationship to retinal degeneration.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

We here report the identification of five independent families with achromatopsia that segregate protein-truncation mutations in the GNAT2 gene, located on chromosome 1p13. GNAT2 encodes the cone photoreceptor-specific alpha-subunit of transducin, a G-protein of the phototransduction cascade, which couples to the visual pigment(s).

21295280,"FAF1, a gene that is disrupted in cleft palate and has conserved function in zebrafish.","Cranial neural crest (CNC) is a multipotent migratory cell population that gives rise to most of the craniofacial bones. An intricate network mediates CNC formation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration along distinct paths, and differentiation. Errors in these processes lead to craniofacial abnormalities, including cleft lip and palate. Clefts are the most common congenital craniofacial defects. Patients have complications with feeding, speech, hearing, and dental and psychological development. Affected by both genetic predisposition and environmental factors, the complex etiology of clefts remains largely unknown. Here we show that Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1) is disrupted and that its expression is decreased in a Pierre Robin family with an inherited translocation. Furthermore, the locus is strongly associated with cleft palate and shows an increased relative risk. Expression studies show that faf1 is highly expressed in zebrafish cartilages during embryogenesis. Knockdown of zebrafish faf1 leads to pharyngeal cartilage defects and jaw abnormality as a result of a failure of CNC to differentiate into and express cartilage-specific markers, such as sox9a and col2a1. Administration of faf1 mRNA rescues this phenotype. Our findings therefore identify FAF1 as a regulator of CNC differentiation and show that it predisposes humans to cleft palate and is necessary for lower jaw development in zebrafish.",review-article; review; journal article

12719379,"Prestin, a cochlear motor protein, is defective in non-syndromic hearing loss.","Prestin, a membrane protein that is highly and almost exclusively expressed in the outer hair cells (OHCs) of the cochlea, is a motor protein which senses membrane potential and drives rapid length changes in OHCs. Surprisingly, prestin is a member of a gene family, solute carrier (SLC) family 26, that encodes anion transporters and related proteins. Of nine known human genes in this family, three (SLC26A2, SLC26A3 and SLC26A4) are associated with different human hereditary diseases. The restricted expression of prestin in OHCs, and its proposed function as a mechanical amplifier, make it a strong candidate gene for human deafness. Here we report the cloning and characterization of four splicing isoforms for the human prestin gene (SLC26A5a, b, c and d). SLC26A5a is the predominant form of prestin whereas the others showed limited distribution associated with certain developmental stages. Based on the functional importance of prestin we screened for possible mutations involving the prestin gene in a group of deaf probands. We have identified a 5'-UTR splice acceptor mutation (IVS2-2A>G) in exon 3 of the prestin gene, which is responsible for recessive non-syndromic deafness in two unrelated families. In addition, a high frequency of heterozygosity for the same mutation was observed in these subjects, suggesting the possibility of semi-dominant influence of the mutation in causing hearing loss. Finally, the observation of this mutation only in the Caucasian probands indicated an association with a specific ethnic background. This study thereby reveals an essential function of prestin in human auditory processing.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17186473,Genetic heterogeneity in Italian families with IgA nephropathy: suggestive linkage for two novel IgA nephropathy loci.,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide, but its etiologic mechanisms are still poorly understood. Different prevalences among ethnic groups and familial aggregation, together with an increased familial risk, suggest important genetic influences on its pathogenesis. A locus for familial IgAN, called ""IGAN1,"" on chromosome 6q22-23 has been described, without the identification of any responsible gene. The partners of the European IgAN Consortium organized a second genomewide scan in 22 new informative Italian multiplex families. A total of 186 subjects (59 affected and 127 unaffected) were genotyped and were included in a two-stage genomewide linkage analysis. The regions 4q26-31 and 17q12-22 exhibited the strongest evidence of linkage by nonparametric analysis (best P=.0025 and .0045, respectively). These localizations were also supported by multipoint parametric analysis, in which peak LOD scores of 1.83 ( alpha =0.50) and 2.56 ( alpha =0.65) were obtained using the affected-only dominant model, and by allowance for the presence of genetic heterogeneity. Our results provide further evidence for genetic heterogeneity among families with IgAN. Evidence of linkage to multiple chromosomal regions is consistent with both an oligo/polygenic and a multiple-susceptibility-gene model for familial IgAN, with small or moderate effects in determining the pathological phenotype. Although we identified new candidate regions, replication studies are required to confirm the genetic contribution to familial IgAN.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
21350122,Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis in humans with inborn errors of interleukin-17 immunity.,"Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis disease (CMCD) is characterized by recurrent or persistent infections of the skin, nails, and oral and genital mucosae caused by Candida albicans and, to a lesser extent, Staphylococcus aureus, in patients with no other infectious or autoimmune manifestations. We report two genetic etiologies of CMCD: autosomal recessive deficiency in the cytokine receptor, interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), and autosomal dominant deficiency of the cytokine interleukin-17F (IL-17F). IL-17RA deficiency is complete, abolishing cellular responses to IL-17A and IL-17F homo- and heterodimers. By contrast, IL-17F deficiency is partial, with mutant IL-17F-containing homo- and heterodimers displaying impaired, but not abolished, activity. These experiments of nature indicate that human IL-17A and IL-17F are essential for mucocutaneous immunity against C. albicans, but otherwise largely redundant.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
21145000,Exome sequencing reveals VCP mutations as a cause of familial ALS.,"Using exome sequencing, we identified a p.R191Q amino acid change in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene in an Italian family with autosomal dominantly inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in VCP have previously been identified in families with Inclusion Body Myopathy, Paget disease, and Frontotemporal Dementia (IBMPFD). Screening of VCP in a cohort of 210 familial ALS cases and 78 autopsy-proven ALS cases identified four additional mutations including a p.R155H mutation in a pathologically proven case of ALS. VCP protein is essential for maturation of ubiquitin-containing autophagosomes, and mutant VCP toxicity is partially mediated through its effect on TDP-43 protein, a major constituent of ubiquitin inclusions that neuropathologically characterize ALS. Our data broaden the phenotype of IBMPFD to include motor neuron degeneration, suggest that VCP mutations may account for ∼1%-2% of familial ALS, and provide evidence directly implicating defects in the ubiquitination/protein degradation pathway in motor neuron degeneration.",research-article; journal article
7929844,Arg60 to Leu mutation of the human thromboxane A2 receptor in a dominantly inherited bleeding disorder.,"Recent advances in molecular genetics have revealed the mechanisms underlying a variety of inherited human disorders. Among them, mutations in G protein-coupled receptors have clearly demonstrated two types of abnormalities, namely loss of function and constitutive activation of the receptors. Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor is a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptors and performs an essential role in hemostasis by interacting with TXA2 to induce platelet aggregation. Here we identify a single amino acid substitution (Arg60-->Leu) in the first cytoplasmic loop of the TXA2 receptor in a dominantly inherited bleeding disorder characterized by defective platelet response to TXA2. This mutation was found exclusively in affected members of two unrelated families with the disorder. The mutant receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed decreased agonist-induced second messenger formation despite its normal ligand binding affinities. These results suggest that the Arg60 to Leu mutation is responsible for the disorder. Moreover, dominant inheritance of the disorder suggests the possibility that the mutation produces a dominant negative TXA2 receptor.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
19828703,A novel thromboxane A2 receptor D304N variant that abrogates ligand binding in a patient with a bleeding diathesis.,"We investigated the cause of mild mucocutaneous bleeding in a 14-year-old male patient (P1). Platelet aggregation and ATP secretion induced by arachidonic acid and the thromboxane A(2) receptor (TxA(2)R) agonist U46619 were reduced in P1 compared with controls, whereas the responses to other platelet agonists were retained. P1 was heterozygous for a transversion within the TBXA2R gene predictive of a D304N substitution in the TxA(2)R. In Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells expressing the variant D304N TxA(2)R, U46619 did not increase cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration, indicating loss of receptor function. The TxA(2)R antagonist [(3)H]-SQ29548 showed an approximate 50% decrease in binding to platelets from P1 but absent binding to Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells expressing variant D304N TxA(2)R. This is the second naturally occurring TxA(2)R variant to be associated with platelet dysfunction and the first in which loss of receptor function is associated with reduced ligand binding. D304 lies within a conserved NPXXY motif in transmembrane domain 7 of the TxA(2)R that is a key structural element in family A G protein-coupled receptors. Our demonstration that the D304N substitution causes clinically significant platelet dysfunction by reducing ligand binding establishes the importance of the NPXXY motif for TxA(2)R function in vivo.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; multicenter study; journal article"
19074352,A null mutation in human APOC3 confers a favorable plasma lipid profile and apparent cardioprotection.,"Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) inhibits triglyceride hydrolysis and has been implicated in coronary artery disease. Through a genome-wide association study, we have found that about 5% of the Lancaster Amish are heterozygous carriers of a null mutation (R19X) in the gene encoding apoC-III (APOC3) and, as a result, express half the amount of apoC-III present in noncarriers. Mutation carriers compared with noncarriers had lower fasting and postprandial serum triglycerides, higher levels of HDL-cholesterol and lower levels of LDL-cholesterol. Subclinical atherosclerosis, as measured by coronary artery calcification, was less common in carriers than noncarriers, which suggests that lifelong deficiency of apoC-III has a cardioprotective effect.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
9884342,Oxidative stress causes enhanced endothelial cell injury in human heme oxygenase-1 deficiency.,"The first known human case of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) deficiency is presented in this report. The patient is a six-year-old boy with severe growth retardation. He has been suffering from persistent hemolytic anemia characterized by marked erythrocyte fragmentation and intravascular hemolysis, with paradoxical increase of serum haptoglobin and low bilirubin. An abnormal coagulation/fibrinolysis system, associated with elevated thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor, indicated the presence of severe, persistent endothelial damage. Electron microscopy of renal glomeruli revealed detachment of endothelium, with subendothelial deposition of an unidentified material. Iron deposition was noted in renal and hepatic tissue. Immunohistochemistry of hepatic tissue and immunoblotting of a cadmium-stimulated Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) revealed complete absence of HO-1 production. An LCL derived from the patient was extremely sensitive to hemin-induced cell injury. Sequence analysis of the patient's HO-1 gene revealed complete loss of exon-2 of the maternal allele and a two-nucleotide deletion within exon3 of the paternal allele. Growth retardation, anemia, iron deposition, and vulnerability to stressful injury are all characteristics observed in recently described HO-1 targeted mice. This study presents not only the first human case of HO-1 deficiency but may also provide clues to the key roles played by this important enzyme in vivo.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"

The claudin family of genes is known to express protein components of tight junctions in other tissues. The essential function of one of these claudins in the inner ear was established by identifying mutations in CLDN14 that cause nonsyndromic recessive deafness DFNB29 in two large consanguineous Pakistani families.

9820300,Leukotriene C4-synthesis deficiency: a new inborn error of metabolism linked to a fatal developmental syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are potent lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid in the 5-lipoxygenase pathway that exert profound biological effects. We investigated synthesis and metabolism of leukotrienes in an infant who presented with muscular hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, and microcephaly. The course of the disease was rapidly progressive and the infant died aged 6 months. METHODS: Cysteinyl leukotrienes and LTB4 were analysed in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, urine, and stimulated monocytes by EIA. We measured [3H]-LTC4 formation from [3H]-LTA4 in monocytes and platelets by radio-high-pressure liquid chromatography. FINDINGS: Concentrations of LTC4 and its metabolites were below the detection limit in the cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and urine. LTC4 could not be generated in stimulated monocytes, whereas LTB4 synthesis was increased. [3H]-LTC4 could not be made from [3H]-LTA4 in the patient's monocytes or platelets. INTERPRETATION: In this patient, inability to synthesise LTC4 suggests a deficiency of LTC4 synthase. This defect is a new inborn error of human eicosanoid metabolism and may be associated with the clinical disorder. Leukotriene analysis should be done in all patients with neurological symptoms who are candidates for metabolic diseases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
20566710,Mitochondrial ATP synthase deficiency due to a mutation in the ATP5E gene for the F1 epsilon subunit.,"F1Fo-ATP synthase is a key enzyme of mitochondrial energy provision producing most of cellular ATP. So far, mitochondrial diseases caused by isolated disorders of the ATP synthase have been shown to result from mutations in mtDNA genes for the subunits ATP6 and ATP8 or in nuclear genes encoding the biogenesis factors TMEM70 and ATPAF2. Here, we describe a patient with a homozygous p.Tyr12Cys mutation in the epsilon subunit encoded by the nuclear gene ATP5E. The 22-year-old woman presented with neonatal onset, lactic acidosis, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, mild mental retardation and developed peripheral neuropathy. Patient fibroblasts showed 60-70% decrease in both oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity and mitochondrial ATP synthesis. The mitochondrial content of the ATP synthase complex was equally reduced, but its size was normal and it contained the mutated epsilon subunit. A similar reduction was found in all investigated F1 and Fo subunits with the exception of Fo subunit c, which was found to accumulate in a detergent-insoluble form. This is the first case of a mitochondrial disease due to a mutation in a nuclear encoded structural subunit of the ATP synthase. Our results indicate an essential role of the epsilon subunit in the biosynthesis and assembly of the F1 part of the ATP synthase. Furthermore, the epsilon subunit seems to be involved in the incorporation of subunit c to the rotor structure of the mammalian enzyme.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
11455388,Mutation of a new gene causes a unique form of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in a genetic isolate of central Puerto Rico.,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and a storage pool deficiency due to an absence of platelet dense bodies. Lysosomal ceroid lipofuscinosis, pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis are occasional manifestations of the disease. HPS occurs with a frequency of one in 1800 in north-west Puerto Rico due to a founder effect. Several non-Puerto Rican patients also have mutations in HPS1, which produces a protein of unknown function. Another gene, ADTB3A, causes HPS in the pearl mouse and in two brothers with HPS-2 (refs. 11,12). ADTB3A encodes a coat protein involved in vesicle formation, implicating HPS as a disorder of membrane trafficking. We sought to identify other HPS-causing genes. Using homozygosity mapping on pooled DNA of 6 families from central Puerto Rico, we localized a new HPS susceptibility gene to a 1.6-cM interval on chromosome 3q24. The gene, HPS3, has 17 exons, and a putative 113.7-kD product expected to reveal how new vesicles form in specialized cells. The homozygous, disease-causing mutation is a large deletion and represents the second example of a founder mutation causing HPS on the small island of Puerto Rico. We also present an allele-specific assay for diagnosing individuals heterozygous or homozygous for this mutation.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article"
21493957,Multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome is caused by a mutation in PIGN.,"BACKGROUND: This study reports on a hitherto undescribed autosomal recessive syndrome characterised by dysmorphic features and multiple congenital anomalies together with severe neurological impairment, chorea and seizures leading to early death, and the identification of a gene involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Homozygosity mapping was performed using Affymetrix Human Mapping 250k NspI arrays. Sequencing of all coding exons of the candidate genes was performed with primer sets designed using the Primer3 program. Fluorescence activated cell sorting was performed using conjugated antibody to CD59. Staining, acquisition and analysis were performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. RESULTS: Using homozygosity mapping, the study mapped the disease locus to 18q21.32-18q22.1 and identified the disease-causing mutation, c.2126Gâ†’A (p.Arg709Gln), in PIGN, which encodes glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) ethanolamine phosphate transferase 1, a protein involved in GPI-anchor biosynthesis. Arginine at the position 709 is a highly evolutionarily conserved residue located in the PigN domain. The expression of GPI linked protein CD59 on fibroblasts from patients as compared to that in a control individual showed a 10-fold reduction in expression, confirming the pathogenic consequences of the mutation on GPI dependent protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: The abundant expression of PIGN in various tissues is compatible with the diverse phenotypic features observed in the patients and with the involvement of multiple body systems. The presence of developmental delay, hypotonia, and epilepsy combined with multiple congenital anomalies, especially anorectal anomalies, should lead a clinician to suspect a GPI deficiency related disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
11093276,"Spectrum of mutations in the Fanconi anaemia group G gene, FANCG/XRCC9.","FANCG was the third Faconi anaemia gene identified and proved to be identical to the previously cloned XRCC9 gene. We present the pathogenic mutations and sequence variants we have so far identified in a panel of FA-G patients. Mutation screening was performed by PCR, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and protein truncation tests. Altogether 18 mutations have been determined in 20 families - 97% of all expected mutant alleles. All mutation types have been found, with the exception of large deletions, the large majority is predicted to lead to shortened proteins. One stop codon mutation, E105X, has been found in several German patients and this founder mutation accounts for 44% of the mutant FANCG alleles in German FA-G patients. Comparison of clinical phenotypes shows that patients homozygous for this mutation have an earlier onset of the haematological disorder than most other FA-G patients. The mouse Fancg sequence was established in order to evaluate missense mutations. A putative missense mutation, L71P, in a possible leucine zipper motif may affect FANCG binding of FANCA and seems to be associated with a milder clinical phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15735645,Mutation in myosin heavy chain 6 causes atrial septal defect.,"Atrial septal defect is one of the most common forms of congenital heart malformation. We identified a new locus linked with atrial septal defect on chromosome 14q12 in a large family with dominantly inherited atrial septal defect. The underlying mutation is a missense substitution, I820N, in alpha-myosin heavy chain (MYH6), a structural protein expressed at high levels in the developing atria, which affects the binding of the heavy chain to its regulatory light chain. The cardiac transcription factor TBX5 strongly regulates expression of MYH6, but mutant forms of TBX5, which cause Holt-Oram syndrome, do not. Morpholino knock-down of expression of the chick MYH6 homolog eliminates the formation of the atrial septum without overtly affecting atrial chamber formation. These data provide evidence for a link between a transcription factor, a structural protein and congenital heart disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
21473986,Human and mouse mutations in WDR35 cause short-rib polydactyly syndromes due to abnormal ciliogenesis.,"Defects in cilia formation and function result in a range of human skeletal and visceral abnormalities. Mutations in several genes have been identified to cause a proportion of these disorders, some of which display genetic (locus) heterogeneity. Mouse models are valuable for dissecting the function of these genes, as well as for more detailed analysis of the underlying developmental defects. The short-rib polydactyly (SRP) group of disorders are among the most severe human phenotypes caused by cilia dysfunction. We mapped the disease locus from two siblings affected by a severe form of SRP to 2p24, where we identified an in-frame homozygous deletion of exon 5 in WDR35. We subsequently found compound heterozygous missense and nonsense mutations in WDR35 in an independent second case with a similar, severe SRP phenotype. In a mouse mutation screen for developmental phenotypes, we identified a mutation in Wdr35 as the cause of midgestation lethality, with abnormalities characteristic of defects in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. We show that endogenous WDR35 localizes to cilia and centrosomes throughout the developing embryo and that human and mouse fibroblasts lacking the protein fail to produce cilia. Through structural modeling, we show that WDR35 has strong homology to the COPI coatamers involved in vesicular trafficking and that human SRP mutations affect key structural elements in WDR35. Our report expands, and sheds new light on, the pathogenesis of the SRP spectrum of ciliopathies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article"
11001624,Anovel catalase mutation (a GA insertion) causes the Hungarian type of acatalasemia.,"Acatalasemia, a deficiency of enzyme catalase, is an autosomal recessive syndrome with an incidence of 5:106 in Hungary. We have examined the first Hungarian acatalasemic family for the disease-causing mutation. All exons of the catalase gene were screened by PCR-SSCP, PCR-heteroduplex, and nucleotide sequence analysis. The heteroduplex formation detected in exon 2 was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. We found a GA insertion at nucleotide position 138, increasing the GA repeat number from 4 to 5. This GA insertion caused a frameshift in the amino acid sequence from position 68 to 133 and generated a TGA terminating codon at amino acid position 134. This truncated protein lacks the essential amino acid (histidine 74) in the active center. This finding can explain the decreased blood catalase activity in the Hungarian acatalasemic family.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

25920557,Ten new cases further delineate the syndromic intellectual disability phenotype caused by mutations in DYRK1A.,"The dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) gene, located on chromosome 21q22.13 within the Down syndrome critical region, has been implicated in syndromic intellectual disability associated with Down syndrome and autism. DYRK1A has a critical role in brain growth and development primarily by regulating cell proliferation, neurogenesis, neuronal plasticity and survival. Several patients have been reported with chromosome 21 aberrations such as partial monosomy, involving multiple genes including DYRK1A. In addition, seven other individuals have been described with chromosomal rearrangements, intragenic deletions or truncating mutations that disrupt specifically DYRK1A. Most of these patients have microcephaly and all have significant intellectual disability. In the present study, we report 10 unrelated individuals with DYRK1A-associated intellectual disability (ID) who display a recurrent pattern of clinical manifestations including primary or acquired microcephaly, ID ranging from mild to severe, speech delay or absence, seizures, autism, motor delay, deep-set eyes, poor feeding and poor weight gain. We identified unique truncating and non-synonymous mutations (three nonsense, four frameshift and two missense) in DYRK1A in nine patients and a large chromosomal deletion that encompassed DYRK1A in one patient. On the basis of increasing identification of mutations in DYRK1A, we suggest that this gene be considered potentially causative in patients presenting with ID, primary or acquired microcephaly, feeding problems and absent or delayed speech with or without seizures.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
23099646,The DYRK1A gene is a cause of syndromic intellectual disability with severe microcephaly and epilepsy.,"BACKGROUND: DYRK1A plays different functions during development, with an important role in controlling brain growth through neuronal proliferation and neurogenesis. It is expressed in a gene dosage dependent manner since dyrk1a haploinsufficiency induces a reduced brain size in mice, and DYRK1A overexpression is the candidate gene for intellectual disability (ID) and microcephaly in Down syndrome. We have identified a 69 kb deletion including the 5' region of the DYRK1A gene in a patient with growth retardation, primary microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, seizures, ataxic gait, absent speech and ID. Because four patients previously reported with intragenic DYRK1A rearrangements or 21q22 microdeletions including only DYRK1A presented with overlapping phenotypes, we hypothesised that DYRK1A mutations could be responsible for syndromic ID with severe microcephaly and epilepsy. METHODS: The DYRK1A gene was studied by direct sequencing and quantitative PCR in a cohort of 105 patients with ID and at least two symptoms from the Angelman syndrome spectrum (microcephaly < -2.5 SD, ataxic gait, seizures and speech delay). RESULTS: We identified a de novo frameshift mutation (c.290_291delCT; p.Ser97Cysfs*98) in a patient with growth retardation, primary severe microcephaly, delayed language, ID, and seizures. CONCLUSION: The identification of a truncating mutation in a patient with ID, severe microcephaly, epilepsy, and growth retardation, combined with its dual function in regulating the neural proliferation/neuronal differentiation, adds DYRK1A to the list of genes responsible for such a phenotype. ID, microcephaly, epilepsy, and language delay are the more specific features associated with DYRK1A abnormalities. DYRK1A studies should be discussed in patients presenting such a phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
25167861,Efficient strategy for the molecular diagnosis of intellectual disability using targeted high-throughput sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: Intellectual disability (ID) is characterised by an extreme genetic heterogeneity. Several hundred genes have been associated to monogenic forms of ID, considerably complicating molecular diagnostics. Trio-exome sequencing was recently proposed as a diagnostic approach, yet remains costly for a general implementation. METHODS: We report the alternative strategy of targeted high-throughput sequencing of 217 genes in which mutations had been reported in patients with ID or autism as the major clinical concern. We analysed 106 patients with ID of unknown aetiology following array-CGH analysis and other genetic investigations. Ninety per cent of these patients were males, and 75% sporadic cases. RESULTS: We identified 26 causative mutations: 16 in X-linked genes (ATRX, CUL4B, DMD, FMR1, HCFC1, IL1RAPL1, IQSEC2, KDM5C, MAOA, MECP2, SLC9A6, SLC16A2, PHF8) and 10 de novo in autosomal-dominant genes (DYRK1A, GRIN1, MED13L, TCF4, RAI1, SHANK3, SLC2A1, SYNGAP1). We also detected four possibly causative mutations (eg, in NLGN3) requiring further investigations. We present detailed reasoning for assigning causality for each mutation, and associated patients' clinical information. Some genes were hit more than once in our cohort, suggesting they correspond to more frequent ID-associated conditions (KDM5C, MECP2, DYRK1A, TCF4). We highlight some unexpected genotype to phenotype correlations, with causative mutations being identified in genes associated to defined syndromes in patients deviating from the classic phenotype (DMD, TCF4, MECP2). We also bring additional supportive (HCFC1, MED13L) or unsupportive (SHROOM4, SRPX2) evidences for the implication of previous candidate genes or mutations in cognitive disorders. CONCLUSIONS: With a diagnostic yield of 25% targeted sequencing appears relevant as a first intention test for the diagnosis of ID, but importantly will also contribute to a better understanding regarding the specific contribution of the many genes implicated in ID and autism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

21421862,Autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome in two families is caused by mutations in the COL9A1 gene.,"PURPOSE: To investigate COL9A1 in two families suggestive of autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome and to delineate the associated phenotype. METHODS: The probands of two consanguineous autosomal recessive Stickler families were evaluated for homozygosity using SNP microarray in one and haplotype analysis in the other. Subsequently, the entire COL9A1 open reading frame was analyzed by DNA sequencing in all members of the respective families. Several family members were investigated for dysmorphic features as well as ophthalmic, audiologic, and radiologic abnormalities. RESULTS: A novel homozygous COL9A1 mutation (p.R507X) was identified in two affected Turkish sisters, and the previously published mutation (p.R295X) was found in a Moroccan boy. Ophthalmic assessment revealed myopia, cataracts, distinct vitreous changes, progressive chorioretinal degeneration, and exudative and rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. All three had sensorineural hearing loss and epiphyseal dysplasia. Intervertebral disc bulging was observed in one patient and in two heterozygous carriers of the p.R507X mutation. CONCLUSIONS: A second, novel mutation was identified in COL9A1, causing autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome together with the previously described nucleotide change in two separate families. Although the overall phenotype was comparable to autosomal dominant Stickler, vitreous changes that may enable recognition of patients who are likely to carry mutations in COL9A1 were identified, and exudative retinal detachment was observed as a new finding in Stickler syndrome.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16909383,A new autosomal recessive form of Stickler syndrome is caused by a mutation in the COL9A1 gene.,"Stickler syndrome is characterized by ophthalmic, articular, orofacial, and auditory manifestations. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is caused by mutations in COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2. We describe a family of Moroccan origin that consists of four children with Stickler syndrome, six unaffected children, and two unaffected parents who are distant relatives (fifth degree). All family members were clinically investigated for ear, nose, and throat; ophthalmologic; and radiological abnormalities. Four children showed symptoms characteristic of Stickler syndrome, including moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss, moderate-to-high myopia with vitreoretinopathy, and epiphyseal dysplasia. We considered the COL9A1 gene, located on chromosome 6q13, to be a candidate gene on the basis of the structural association with collagen types II and XI and because of the high expression in the human inner ear indicated by cDNA microarray. Mutation analysis of the coding region of the COL9A1 gene showed a homozygous R295X mutation in the four affected children. The parents and four unaffected children were heterozygous carriers of the R295X mutation. Two unaffected children were homozygous for the wild-type allele. None of the family members except the homozygous R295X carriers had any signs of Stickler syndrome. Therefore, COL9A1 is the fourth identified gene that can cause Stickler syndrome. In contrast to the three previously reported Stickler syndrome-causing genes, this gene causes a form of Stickler syndrome with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This finding will have a major impact on the genetic counseling of patients with Stickler syndrome and on the understanding of the pathophysiology of collagens. Mutation analysis of this gene is recommended in patients with Stickler syndrome with possible autosomal recessive inheritance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
11565064,A mutation in COL9A1 causes multiple epiphyseal dysplasia: further evidence for locus heterogeneity.,"Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) is an autosomal dominantly inherited chondrodysplasia. It is clinically highly heterogeneous, partially because of its complex genetic background. Mutations in four genes, COL9A2, COL9A3, COMP, and MATR3, all coding for cartilage extracellular matrix components (i.e., the alpha2 and alpha 3 chains of collagen IX, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and matrilin-3), have been identified in this disease so far, but no mutations have yet been reported in the third collagen IX gene, COL9A1, which codes for the alpha1(IX) chain. MED with apparently recessive inheritance has been reported in some families. A homozygous R279W mutation was recently found in the diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter gene, DTDST, in a patient with MED who had a club foot and double-layered patella. The series consisted of 41 probands with MED, 16 of whom were familial and on 4 of whom linkage analyses were performed. Recombination was observed between COL9A1, COL9A2, COL9A3, and COMP and the MED phenotype in two of the families, and between COL9A2, COL9A3, and COMP and the phenotype in the other two families. Screening of COL9A1 for mutations in the two probands from the families in which this gene was not involved in the recombinations failed to identify any disease-causing mutations. The remaining 37 probands were screened for mutations in all three collagen IX genes and in the COMP gene. The probands with talipes deformities or multipartite patella were also screened for the R279W mutation in DTDST. The analysis resulted in identification of three mutations in COMP and one in COL9A1, but none in the other two collagen IX genes. Two of the probands with a multipartite patella had the homozygous DTDST mutation. The results show that mutations in COL9A1 can cause MED, but they also suggest that mutations in COL9A1, COL9A2, COL9A3, COMP, and DTDST are not the major causes of MED and that there exists at least one additional locus.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
22744658,Clinical features of SCA36: a novel spinocerebellar ataxia with motor neuron involvement (Asidan).,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the phenotype of spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36), a novel dominant disorder (nicknamed ""Asidan"") caused by a hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of the NOP56 gene. METHODS: We investigated the clinical, genetic, and neuropathologic characteristics of 18 patients with SCA36. We performed histologic evaluation of a muscle biopsy specimen from 1 patient with SCA36, and neuropathologic evaluation of an autopsied brain from another patient with SCA36. RESULTS: The (GGCCTG)n expansion was found in 18 ataxic patients from 9 families. The age at onset of ataxia was 53.1 Â± 3.4 years, with the most frequent symptoms being truncal ataxia (100% of patients), ataxic dysarthria (100%), limb ataxia (93%), and hyperreflexia (79%). Tongue fasciculation and subsequent atrophy were found in 71% of cases, particularly in those of long duration. Skeletal muscle fasciculation and atrophy of the limbs and trunk were found in 57% of cases. Lower motor involvement was confirmed by EMG and muscle biopsy. The neuropathologic study revealed significant cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration with obvious loss of lower motor neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that NOP56 was localized to the nuclei of various neurons. Cytoplasmic or intranuclear inclusion staining of NOP56, TDP-43, and ataxin-2 was not observed in the remaining neurons. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of the unique clinical features of SCA36, a relatively pure cerebellar ataxia with progressive motor neuron involvement. Thus, SCA36 is a disease that stands at the crossroads of SCA and motor neuron disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
22492559,'Costa da Morte' ataxia is spinocerebellar ataxia 36: clinical and genetic characterization.,"Spinocerebellar ataxia 36 has been recently described in Japanese families as a new type of spinocerebellar ataxia with motor neuron signs. It is caused by a GGCCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of NOP56. Family interview and document research allowed us to reconstruct two extensive, multigenerational kindreds stemming from the same village (Costa da Morte in Galicia, Spain), in the 17th century. We found the presence of the spinocerebellar ataxia 36 mutation co-segregating with disease in these families in whom we had previously identified an ~0.8 Mb linkage region to chromosome 20 p. Subsequent screening revealed the NOP56 expansion in eight additional Galician ataxia kindreds. While normal alleles contain 5-14 hexanucleotide repeats, expanded alleles range from ~650 to 2500 repeats, within a shared haplotype. Further expansion of repeat size was frequent, especially upon paternal transmission, while instances of allele contraction were observed in maternal transmissions. We found a total of 63 individuals carrying the mutation, 44 of whom were confirmed to be clinically affected; over 400 people are at risk. We describe here the detailed clinical picture, consisting of a late-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome with variable eye movement abnormalities and sensorineural hearing loss. There were signs of denervation in the tongue, as well as mild pyramidal signs, but otherwise no signs of classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were consistent with the clinical course, showing atrophy of the cerebellar vermis in initial stages, later evolving to a pattern of olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy. We estimated the origin of the founder mutation in Galicia to have occurred ~1275 years ago. Out of 160 Galician families with spinocerebellar ataxia, 10 (6.3%) were found to have spinocerebellar ataxia 36, while 15 (9.4%) showed other of the routinely tested dominant spinocerebellar ataxia types. Spinocerebellar ataxia 36 is thus, so far, the most frequent dominant spinocerebellar ataxia in this region, which may have implications for American countries associated with traditional Spanish emigration.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26477546,Joubert Syndrome in French Canadians and Identification of Mutations in CEP104.,"Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a primarily autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by a distinctive mid-hindbrain and cerebellar malformation, oculomotor apraxia, irregular breathing, developmental delay, and ataxia. JBTS is a genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy. We sought to characterize the genetic landscape associated with JBTS in the French Canadian (FC) population. We studied 43 FC JBTS subjects from 35 families by combining targeted and exome sequencing. We identified pathogenic (n = 32 families) or possibly pathogenic (n = 2 families) variants in genes previously associated with JBTS in all of these subjects, except for one. In the latter case, we found a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.735+2T>C) in CEP104. Interestingly, we identified two additional non-FC JBTS subjects with mutations in CEP104; one of these subjects harbors a maternally inherited nonsense mutation (c.496C>T [p.Arg166*]) and a de novo splice-site mutation (c.2572-2A>G), whereas the other bears a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.1328_1329insT [p.Tyr444fs*3]) in CEP104. Previous studies have shown that CEP104 moves from the mother centriole to the tip of the primary cilium during ciliogenesis. Knockdown of CEP104 in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1) cells resulted in severe defects in ciliogenesis. These observations suggest that CEP104 acts early during cilia formation by regulating the conversion of the mother centriole into the cilia basal body. We conclude that disruption of CEP104 causes JBTS. Our study also reveals that the cause of JBTS has been elucidated in the great majority of our FC subjects (33/35 [94%] families), even though JBTS shows substantial locus and allelic heterogeneity in this population.",review-article; review; journal article
21725307,A transition zone complex regulates mammalian ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane composition.,"Mutations affecting ciliary components cause ciliopathies. As described here, we investigated Tectonic1 (Tctn1), a regulator of mouse Hedgehog signaling, and found that it is essential for ciliogenesis in some, but not all, tissues. Cell types that do not require Tctn1 for ciliogenesis require it to localize select membrane-associated proteins to the cilium, including Arl13b, AC3, Smoothened and Pkd2. Tctn1 forms a complex with multiple ciliopathy proteins associated with Meckel and Joubert syndromes, including Mks1, Tmem216, Tmem67, Cep290, B9d1, Tctn2 and Cc2d2a. Components of this complex co-localize at the transition zone, a region between the basal body and ciliary axoneme. Like Tctn1, loss of Tctn2, Tmem67 or Cc2d2a causes tissue-specific defects in ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane composition. Consistent with a shared function for complex components, we identified a mutation in TCTN1 that causes Joubert syndrome. Thus, a transition zone complex of Meckel and Joubert syndrome proteins regulates ciliary assembly and trafficking, suggesting that transition zone dysfunction is the cause of these ciliopathies.",research-article; journal article
21310491,CLRN1 mutations cause nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the mutations in the CLRN1 gene in patients from 2 consanguineous Pakistani families diagnosed with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP). DESIGN: Case-series study. PARTICIPANTS: Affected and unaffected individuals of 2 consanguineous Pakistani families and 90 unaffected controls from the same population. Informed consent was obtained from participants and the protocol was approved by a local institutional review board. METHODS: Patients of 2 consanguineous families were genotyped with single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays for genome-wide linkage analysis. The search for potential candidate genes within the 8-Mb overlapping homozygous region in these families revealed the presence of CLRN1, a gene previously known to cause Usher's syndrome type III (USH3), which was analyzed by direct sequence analysis. The clinical diagnosis was based on the presence of night blindness, fundoscopic findings, and electroretinography (ERG) results. Additionally, pure tone audiometry was performed to rule out Usher's syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fundoscopy, single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray, DNA sequence analysis, ERG, and audiometry. RESULTS: Sequencing of CLRN1 revealed novel missense mutations (p.Pro31Leu and p.Leu154Trp) segregating in 2 families. Analysis of fundus photographs indicated attenuation of the retinal vessels, and bone spicule pigmentation in the periphery of the retina. The ERG responses were indicative of a rod-cone pattern of the disease. Audiometric assessment revealed no hearing impairment, thereby excluding Usher's syndrome. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated the retention of the mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the wild-type protein was mainly present at the cell membrane. CONCLUSIONS: The RP-associated mutations p.Pro31Leu and p.Leu154Trp may represent hypomorphic mutations, because the substituted amino acids located in the transmembrane domains remain polar, whereas more severe changes have been detected in patients with USH3. These data indicate that mutations in CLRN1 are associated not only with USH3, but also with nonsyndromic arRP.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
21683322,Mutations in the TGFβ binding-protein-like domain 5 of FBN1 are responsible for acromicric and geleophysic dysplasias.,"Geleophysic (GD) and acromicric dysplasia (AD) belong to the acromelic dysplasia group and are both characterized by severe short stature, short extremities, and stiff joints. Although AD has an unknown molecular basis, we have previously identified ADAMTSL2 mutations in a subset of GD patients. After exome sequencing in GD and AD cases, we selected fibrillin 1 (FBN1) as a candidate gene, even though mutations in this gene have been described in Marfan syndrome, which is characterized by tall stature and arachnodactyly. We identified 16 heterozygous FBN1 mutations that are all located in exons 41 and 42 and encode TGFβ-binding protein-like domain 5 (TB5) of FBN1 in 29 GD and AD cases. Microfibrillar network disorganization and enhanced TGFβ signaling were consistent features in GD and AD fibroblasts. Importantly, a direct interaction between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1 was demonstrated, suggesting a disruption of this interaction as the underlying mechanism of GD and AD phenotypes. Although enhanced TGFβ signaling caused by FBN1 mutations can trigger either Marfan syndrome or GD and AD, our findings support the fact that TB5 mutations in FBN1 are responsible for short stature phenotypes.",editorial; review; journal article
16912710,Recessive missense mutations in LAMB2 expand the clinical spectrum of LAMB2-associated disorders.,"Congenital nephrotic syndrome is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. The majority of cases can be attributed to mutations in the genes NPHS1, NPHS2, and WT1. By homozygosity mapping in a consanguineous family with isolated congenital nephrotic syndrome, we identified a potential candidate region on chromosome 3p. The LAMB2 gene, which was recently reported as mutated in Pierson syndrome (microcoria-congenital nephrosis syndrome; OMIM #609049), was located in the linkage interval. Sequencing of all coding exons of LAMB2 revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation (R246Q) in both affected children. A different mutation at this codon (R246W), which is highly conserved through evolution, has recently been reported as causing Pierson syndrome. Subsequent LAMB2 mutational screening in six additional families with congenital nephrotic syndrome revealed compound heterozygosity for two novel missense mutations in one family with additional nonspecific ocular anomalies. These findings demonstrate that the spectrum of LAMB2-associated disorders is broader than previously anticipated and includes congenital nephrotic syndrome without eye anomalies or with minor ocular changes different from those observed in Pierson syndrome. This phenotypic variability likely reflects specific genotypes. We conclude that mutational analysis in LAMB2 should be considered in congenital nephrotic syndrome, if no mutations are found in NPHS1, NPHS2, or WT1.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
21802063,"Mutations in CDON, encoding a hedgehog receptor, result in holoprosencephaly and defective interactions with other hedgehog receptors.","Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a common human congenital anomaly defined by a failure to delineate the midline of the forebrain and/or midface, is associated with diminished Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-pathway activity in development of these structures. SHH signaling is regulated by a network of ligand-binding factors, including the primary receptor PTCH1 and the putative coreceptors, CDON (also called CDO), BOC, and GAS1. Although binding of SHH to these receptors promotes pathway activity, it is not known whether interactions between these receptors are important. We report here identification of missense CDON mutations in human HPE. These mutations diminish CDON's ability to support SHH-dependent gene expression in cell-based signaling assays. The mutations occur outside the SHH-binding domain of CDON, and the encoded variant CDON proteins do not display defects in binding to SHH. In contrast, wild-type CDON associates with PTCH1 and GAS1, but the variants do so inefficiently, in a manner that parallels their activity in cell-based assays. Our findings argue that CDON must associate with both ligand and other hedgehog-receptor components, particularly PTCH1, for signaling to occur and that disruption of the latter interactions is a mechanism of HPE.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
16709486,Linkage of a locus determining familial progressive hyperpigmentation (FPH) to chromosome 19p13.1-pter in a Chinese family.,"Familial progressive hyperpigmentation (FPH) is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by patches of hyperpigmentation in the skin which are present at birth or in early infancy and increase in size and number with age. Although previous studies showed that FPH is a monogenic trait, the genetic basis for this disease is unknown. Using a genome screening with 182 STR markers from autosomes in a three-generation Chinese family with 17 members, including 6 affected individuals, we identified a locus linked to chromosome 19p13.1-pter responsible for FPH, spanning 45.48 cM between D19S593 and 19pter. Interestingly, this region harbors the LKB1 gene, in which germline mutations were shown to be associated with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS). PJS and FPH share the disorder of hyperpigmentation, the fine mapping of the FPH gene is expected to lead to a better understanding of the etiology for both FPH and PJS. The linkage of FPH locus to human chromosome 19p13.1-pter provides a genetic basis for further fine mapping.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20054564,Mapping of a novel autosomal recessive hypotrichosis locus on chromosome 10q11.23â€“22.3.,"Autosomal recessive hypotrichosis is a rare form of human genetic disorder characterized by sparse to absent hair on scalp and rest of the body of affected individuals. Over the past few years at least five autosomal recessive forms of hypotrichosis loci have been mapped on different human chromosomes. In the present study, we report localization of another novel autosomal recessive hypotrichosis locus on human chromosome 10q11.23-22.3 in a four generation consanguineous Pakistani family. All the four patients in the family showed typical features of hereditary hypotrichosis including sparse hair on the scalp and rest of the body. Human genome scan using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers mapped the disease locus to a large region on chromosome 10. This novel locus maps to 29.81 cM (28.5 Mb) region, flanked by markers D10S538 and D10S2327 on chromosome 10q11.23-22.3. A maximum multipoint LOD score of 3.26 was obtained with several markers in this region. DNA sequence analysis of exons and splice-junction sites of four putative candidate genes (P4HA1, ZNF365, ZMYND17, MYST4), located in the linkage interval, were sequenced but were negative for functional sequence variants.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
21841779,Exome sequencing identifies ACSF3 as a cause of combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria.,"We used exome sequencing to identify the genetic basis of combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA). We sequenced the exome of an individual with CMAMMA and followed up with sequencing of eight additional affected individuals (cases). This included one individual who was identified and diagnosed by searching an exome database. We identify mutations in ACSF3, encoding a putative methylmalonyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA synthetase as a cause of CMAMMA. We also examined a canine model of CMAMMA, which showed pathogenic mutations in a predicted ACSF3 ortholog. ACSF3 mutant alleles occur with a minor allele frequency of 0.0058 in ∼1,000 control individuals, predicting a CMAMMA population incidence of ∼1:30,000. ACSF3 deficiency is the first human disorder identified as caused by mutations in a gene encoding a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase family, a diverse group of evolutionarily conserved proteins, and may emerge as one of the more common human metabolic disorders.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23232697,Report of four new patients with protein-truncating mutations in C6orf221/KHDC3L and colocalization with NLRP7.,"To date, two maternal-effect genes have been shown to have causative roles in recurrent hydatidiform moles (RHMs); NLRP7 that is mutated in 48-60% of patients with RHMs and C6orf221 (HUGO-approved nomenclature is now KHDC3L), a recently identified gene, that is mutated in 14% of patients with RHMs who are negative for NLRP7 mutations. We sequenced KHDC3L in 97 patients with RHMs and reproductive loss who are mostly negative for NLRP7 mutations. We identified three unrelated patients, each homozygous for one of the two protein-truncating mutations, a novel 4-bp deletion resulting in a frameshift, c.299_302delTCAA, p.Ile100Argfs*2, and a previously described 4-bp deletion, c.322_325delGACT, p.Asp108Ilefs*30, transmitted on a shared haplotype to three patients from different populations. We show that five HM tissues from one of these patients are diploid and biparental similar to HMs from patients with two defective NLRP7 mutations. Using immunofluorescence, we show that KHDC3L protein displays a juxta perinuclear signal and colocalizes with NLRP7 in lymphoblastoid cell lines from normal subjects. Using cell lines from patients, we demonstrate that the KHDC3L mutations do not change the subcellular localization of the protein in hematopoietic cells. Our data highlight the similarities between the two causative genes for RHMs, KHDC3L and NLRP7, in their subcellular localization, the parental contribution to the HM tissues caused by them, and the presence of several founder mutations and variants in both of them indicating positive selection and adaptation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
21629298,Homozygosity mapping in 64 Syrian consanguineous families with non-specific intellectual disability reveals 11 novel loci and high heterogeneity.,"Non-specific intellectual disability of autosomal recessive inheritance (NS-ARID) represents an important fraction of severe cognitive dysfunction disorders. To date, only 10 genes have been identified, and further 24 linked-ARID loci have been reported, as well as others with suggestive linkage. To discover novel genes causing NS-ARID, we undertook genome-wide homozygosity mapping in 64 consanguineous multiplex families of Syrian descent. A total of 11 families revealed unique, significantly linked loci at 4q26-4q28 (MRT17), 6q12-q15 (MRT18), 18p11 (MRT19), 16p12-q12 (MRT20), 11p15 (MRT21), 11p13-q14 (MRT23), 6p12 (MRT24), 12q13-q15 (MRT25), 14q11-q12 (MRT26), 15q23-q26 (MRT27), and 6q26-q27 (MRT28), respectively. Loci ranged between 1.2 and 45.6 Mb in length. One family showed linkage to chromosome 8q24.3, and we identified a mutation in TRAPPC9. Our study further highlights the extreme heterogeneity of NS-ARID, and suggests that no major disease gene is to be expected, at least in this study group. Systematic analysis of large numbers of affected families, as presented here, will help discovering the genetic causes of ID.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
769701,Defective opsonization. A common immunity deficiency.,"Serum opsonization of yeasts for phagocytosis by normal polymorphonuclear leucocytes was defective in 11 of 43 children with unexplained frequent infections. The children had a range of infections, largely bacterial, and only 3 had diarrhoea and rash in infancy. A similar defect in at least 6 of the 9 mothers of these children (of either sex), with normal function in the fathers, suggests that the defect was primary and was transmitted by an unusual form of dominant inheritance. Four of 72 healthy adults and 1 of 11 children with unrelated disease showed similar defective function, but the incidence of the defect in the patients with frequent infection was significantly greater than this. The defective function can be corrected, in vitro and in vivo, by normal plasma at concentrations too low to be effective alone. This suggests that there is a defective factor rather than an inhibitor, and that different factors are limiting in normal and in defective plasma. Sera from affected members of the same family do not correct each other, but defective sera from different families usually do.",comparative study; journal article
7707811,Mannose binding protein gene mutations associated with unusual and severe infections in adults.,"A defect in opsonisation can cause a common immunodeficiency. A mutation in mannose binding protein (MBP) caused by point mutations in the MBP gene will lead to such a defect. This type of syndrome can cause recurrent infections in infants between 6 and 18 months of age but is not generally believed to predispose to adult infections. We looked at 4 patients with severe and unusual infections in whom MBP gene mutations were the only identified cause of immunodeficiency and one patient with combined MBP and IgA deficiency. We analysed the MBP genotypes of all the patients in whom we suspected an immunodeficiency because of their clinical history. Infections seen were recurrent skin abscesses, chronic cryptosporidial diarrhoea, meningococcal meningitis with recurrent herpes simplex, and fatal klebsiella lobar pneumonia. Both sexes were affected and ages ranged from 15 to 56 years. Two patients were homozygous for codon 54 mutations, one patient had codon 52 and codon 54 mutations and was phenotypically homozygous, and two patients were heterozygous for codon 54 mutations. Individuals homozygous for MBP mutations are unusual in the general population (approximate frequency 0.3%). The occurrence of three homozygotes for MBP mutations among these five infected patients suggests that MBP deficiency may confer a life-long risk of infection.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
22019272,Craniosynostosis and multiple skeletal anomalies in humans and zebrafish result from a defect in the localized degradation of retinoic acid.,"Excess exogenous retinoic acid (RA) has been well documented to have teratogenic effects in the limb and craniofacial skeleton. Malformations that have been observed in this context include craniosynostosis, a common developmental defect of the skull that occurs in 1 in 2500 individuals and results from premature fusion of the cranial sutures. Despite these observations, a physiological role for RA during suture formation has not been demonstrated. Here, we present evidence that genetically based alterations in RA signaling interfere with human development. We have identified human null and hypomorphic mutations in the gene encoding the RA-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 that lead to skeletal and craniofacial anomalies, including fusions of long bones, calvarial bone hypoplasia, and craniosynostosis. Analyses of murine embryos exposed to a chemical inhibitor of Cyp26 enzymes and zebrafish lines with mutations in cyp26b1 suggest that the endochondral bone fusions are due to unrestricted chondrogenesis at the presumptive sites of joint formation within cartilaginous templates, whereas craniosynostosis is induced by a defect in osteoblastic differentiation. Ultrastructural analysis, in situ expression studies, and in vitro quantitative RT-PCR experiments of cellular markers of osseous differentiation indicate that the most likely cause for these phenomena is aberrant osteoblast-osteocyte transitioning. This work reveals a physiological role for RA in partitioning skeletal elements and in the maintenance of cranial suture patency.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
21922598,Carboxypeptidase A6 gene (CPA6) mutations in a recessive familial form of febrile seizures and temporal lobe epilepsy and in sporadic temporal lobe epilepsy.,"Febrile seizures (FS) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) were found in four of the seven siblings born to healthy Moroccan consanguineous parents. We hypothesized autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance. Combined linkage analysis and autozygosity mapping of a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping identified a unique identical by descent (IBD) locus of 9.6 Mb on human chromosome 8q12.1-q13.2. Sequencing of the 38 genes mapped within the linked interval revealed a homozygous missense mutation c.809C>T (p.Ala270Val) in the carboxypeptidase A6 gene (CPA6). Screening all exons of CPA6 in unrelated patients with partial epilepsy (n = 195) and FS (n = 145) revealed a new heterozygous missense mutation c.799G>A (p.Gly267Arg) in three TLE patients. Structural modeling of CPA6 indicated that both mutations are located near the enzyme's active site. In contrast to wild-type CPA6, which is secreted and binds to the extracellular matrix where it is enzymatically active, Ala270Val CPA6 was secreted at about 40% of the level of the wild-type CPA6 and was fully active, while Gly267Arg CPA6 was not detected in the medium or extracellular matrix. This study suggests that CPA6 is genetically linked to an AR familial form of FS and TLE, and is associated with sporadic TLE cases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16287139,Identification and functional analysis of CITED2 mutations in patients with congenital heart defects.,"Recent reports have demonstrated that mice lacking the transcription factor Cited2 die in utero showing various cardiac malformations. We present for the first time functionally relevant mutations of CITED2 in patients with congenital heart defects (CHDs). CITED2 encodes a CREBBP/EP300 interacting transcriptional modulator of HIF1A and TFAP2. To study the potential impact of sequence variations in CITED2 for CHDs in humans, we screened a cohort of 392 well-characterized patients and 192 control individuals using DHPLC, sequencing, and Amplifluor genotyping techniques. We identified 15 CITED2 nucleotide alterations. Seven of these alterations were found only in CHD patients and were not detected in controls, including three mutations leading to alterations of the amino acid sequence (p.Ser170_Gly178del, p.Gly178_Ser179ins9, and p.Ser198_Gly199del). All three of these amino acid changing mutations cluster in the serine-glycine-rich junction of the protein, to which no functionality had heretofore been assigned. Here we show that these mutations significantly reduce the capacity of CITED2 to transrepress HIF1A, and that the p.Ser170_Gly178del mutation significantly diminishes TFAP2C coactivation. This reveals a modifying role for the serine-glycine-rich region in CITED2 function. In summary, the observation of these mutations in patients with septal defects indicates that CITED2 has a causative impact in the development of CHD in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
20865121,Mutation in the gene encoding ubiquitin ligase LRSAM1 in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) represents a family of related sensorimotor neuropathies. We studied a large family from a rural eastern Canadian community, with multiple individuals suffering from a condition clinically most similar to autosomal recessive axonal CMT, or AR-CMT2. Homozygosity mapping with high-density SNP genotyping of six affected individuals from the family excluded 23 known genes for various subtypes of CMT and instead identified a single homozygous region on chromosome 9, at 122,423,730-129,841,977 Mbp, shared identical by state in all six affected individuals. A homozygous pathogenic variant was identified in the gene encoding leucine rich repeat and sterile alpha motif 1 (LRSAM1) by direct DNA sequencing of genes within the region in affected DNA samples. The single nucleotide change mutates an intronic consensus acceptor splicing site from AG to AA. Direct analysis of RNA from patient blood demonstrated aberrant splicing of the affected exon, causing an obligatory frameshift and premature truncation of the protein. Western blotting of immortalized cells from a homozygous patient showed complete absence of detectable protein, consistent with the splice site defect. LRSAM1 plays a role in membrane vesicle fusion during viral maturation and for proper adhesion of neuronal cells in culture. Other ubiquitin ligases play documented roles in neurodegenerative diseases. LRSAM1 is a strong candidate for the causal gene for the genetic disorder in our kindred.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
22012984,A frameshift mutation in LRSAM1 is responsible for a dominant hereditary polyneuropathy.,"Despite the high number of genes identified in hereditary polyneuropathies/Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, the genetic defect in many families is still unknown. Here we report the identification of a new gene for autosomal dominant axonal neuropathy in a large three-generation family. Linkage analysis identified a 5 Mb region on 9q33-34 with a LOD score of 5.12. Sequence capture and next-generation sequencing of the region of interest identified five previously unreported non-synonymous heterozygous single nucleotide changes or indels, four of which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Two sequence variants co-segregated with the disease, and one, a 2 bp insertion in the last exon of LRSAM1, was also absent in 676 ethnicity-matched control chromosomes. This frameshift mutation (p.Leu708Argfx28) is located in the C-terminal RING finger motif of the encoded protein. Ubiquitin ligase activity in transfected cells with constructs carrying the patient mutation was affected as measured by a higher level of abundance of TSG101, the only reported target of LRSAM1. Injections of morpholino oligonucleotides in zebrafish embryos directed against the ATG or last splice site of zebrafish Lrsam1 disturbed neurodevelopment, showing a less organized neural structure and, in addition, affected tail formation and movement. LRSAM1 is highly expressed in adult spinal cord motoneurons as well as in fetal spinal cord and muscle tissue. Recently, a homozygous mutation in LRSAM1 was proposed as a strong candidate for the disease in a family with recessive axonal polyneuropathy. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that LRSAM1 mutations can cause both dominant and recessive forms of CMT.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19648921,Mutations in PYCR1 cause cutis laxa with progeroid features.,"Autosomal recessive cutis laxa (ARCL) describes a group of syndromal disorders that are often associated with a progeroid appearance, lax and wrinkled skin, osteopenia and mental retardation. Homozygosity mapping in several kindreds with ARCL identified a candidate region on chromosome 17q25. By high-throughput sequencing of the entire candidate region, we detected disease-causing mutations in the gene PYCR1. We found that the gene product, an enzyme involved in proline metabolism, localizes to mitochondria. Altered mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential and increased apoptosis rate upon oxidative stress were evident in fibroblasts from affected individuals. Knockdown of the orthologous genes in Xenopus and zebrafish led to epidermal hypoplasia and blistering that was accompanied by a massive increase of apoptosis. Our findings link mutations in PYCR1 to altered mitochondrial function and progeroid changes in connective tissues.",research-article; journal article

Here we describe a child with classic features of hypothyroidism (growth retardation, developmental retardation, skeletal dysplasia, and severe constipation) but only borderline-abnormal thyroid hormone levels. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in a gene encoding thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) and generating a mutant protein that inhibits wild-type receptor action in a dominant negative manner. Our observations are consistent with defective human TRα-mediated thyroid hormone resistance and substantiate the concept of hormone action through distinct receptor subtypes in different target tissues.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
22080950,A novel recurrent mutation in MITF predisposes to familial and sporadic melanoma.,"So far, two genes associated with familial melanoma have been identified, accounting for a minority of genetic risk in families. Mutations in CDKN2A account for approximately 40% of familial cases, and predisposing mutations in CDK4 have been reported in a very small number of melanoma kindreds. Here we report the whole-genome sequencing of probands from several melanoma families, which we performed in order to identify other genes associated with familial melanoma. We identify one individual carrying a novel germline variant (coding DNA sequence c.G1075A; protein sequence p.E318K; rs149617956) in the melanoma-lineage-specific oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Although the variant co-segregated with melanoma in some but not all cases in the family, linkage analysis of 31 families subsequently identified to carry the variant generated a log of odds (lod) score of 2.7 under a dominant model, indicating E318K as a possible intermediate risk variant. Consistent with this, the E318K variant was significantly associated with melanoma in a large Australian case-control sample. Likewise, it was similarly associated in an independent case-control sample from the United Kingdom. In the Australian sample, the variant allele was significantly over-represented in cases with a family history of melanoma, multiple primary melanomas, or both. The variant allele was also associated with increased naevus count and non-blue eye colour. Functional analysis of E318K showed that MITF encoded by the variant allele had impaired sumoylation and differentially regulated several MITF targets. These data indicate that MITF is a melanoma-predisposition gene and highlight the utility of whole-genome sequencing to identify novel rare variants associated with disease susceptibility.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

Despite a lack of sequence homology, the genes are aligned in a head-to-tail configuration and joined by chromosomal rearrangement at the amphibian-to-reptile evolutionary transition. Expression of the two genes is mediated by a conserved regulatory element in the noncoding intergenic region. Coordinated expression is important for their interdependent cellular role in vesicular transport to primary cilia. Hence, during vertebrate evolution of genes involved in ciliogenesis, nonparalogous genes were arranged to a functional gene cluster with shared regulatory elements.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
21079152,Somatic KRAS mutations associated with a human nonmalignant syndrome of autoimmunity and abnormal leukocyte homeostasis.,"Somatic gain-of-function mutations in members of the RAS subfamily of small guanosine triphosphatases are found in > 30% of all human cancers. We recently described a syndrome of chronic nonmalignant lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and autoimmunity associated with a mutation in NRAS affecting hematopoietic cells, and initially we classified the disease as a variant of the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. Here, we demonstrate that somatic mutations in the related KRAS gene can also be associated with a nonmalignant syndrome of autoimmunity and breakdown of leukocyte homeostasis. The activating KRAS mutation impaired cytokine withdrawal-induced T-cell apoptosis through the suppression of the proapoptotic protein BCL-2 interacting mediator of cell death and facilitated proliferation through p27(kip1) down-regulation. These defects could be corrected in vitro by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 or phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase inhibition. We suggest the use of the term RAS-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disease to differentiate this disorder from autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; brief-report; journal article; case reports"
22231303,A novel primary human immunodeficiency due to deficiency in the WASP-interacting protein WIP.,"A female offspring of consanguineous parents, showed features of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), including recurrent infections, eczema, thrombocytopenia, defective T cell proliferation and chemotaxis, and impaired natural killer cell function. Cells from this patient had undetectable WAS protein (WASP), but normal WAS sequence and messenger RNA levels. WASP interacting protein (WIP), which stabilizes WASP, was also undetectable. A homozygous c.1301C>G stop codon mutation was found in the WIPF1 gene, which encodes WIP. Introduction of WIP into the patient's T cells restored WASP expression. These findings indicate that WIP deficiency should be suspected in patients with features of WAS in whom WAS sequence and mRNA levels are normal.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
22177090,"Mutations in C8orf37, encoding a ciliary protein, are associated with autosomal-recessive retinal dystrophies with early macular involvement.","Cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are clinically and genetically overlapping heterogeneous retinal dystrophies. By using homozygosity mapping in an individual with autosomal-recessive (ar) RP from a consanguineous family, we identified three sizeable homozygous regions, together encompassing 46 Mb. Next-generation sequencing of all exons, flanking intron sequences, microRNAs, and other highly conserved genomic elements in these three regions revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.497T>A [p.Leu166(âˆ—)]) in C8orf37, located on chromosome 8q22.1. This mutation was not present in 150 ethnically matched control individuals, single-nucleotide polymorphism databases, or the 1000 Genomes database. Immunohistochemical studies revealed C8orf37 localization at the base of the primary cilium of human retinal pigment epithelium cells and at the base of connecting cilia of mouse photoreceptors. C8orf37 sequence analysis of individuals who had retinal dystrophy and carried conspicuously large homozygous regions encompassing C8orf37 revealed a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.156-2A>G) in two siblings of a consanguineous family and homozygous missense mutations (c.529C>T [p.Arg177Trp]; c.545A>G [p.Gln182Arg]) in siblings of two other consanguineous families. The missense mutations affect highly conserved amino acids, and in silico analyses predicted that both variants are probably pathogenic. Clinical assessment revealed CRD in four individuals and RP with early macular involvement in two individuals. The two CRD siblings with the c.156-2A>G mutation also showed unilateral postaxial polydactyly. These results underline the importance of disrupted ciliary processes in the pathogenesis of retinal dystrophies.",research-article; journal article

This syndrome is nonhereditary and is characterized by multiple enchondromas and hemangiomas. It occurs in all races with no sex predominance. The enchondromas and hemangiomas can occur anywhere but are most common in the hands. Long bone involvement is common and leads to progressive skeletal deformity and pathologic fractures. The incidence of malignancies in patients with this syndrome is high. Chondrosarcomas are especially common and occur in 30% of the patients.,review; journal article; case reports
22437503,Role of corin in trophoblast invasion and uterine spiral artery remodelling in pregnancy.,"In pregnancy, trophoblast invasion and uterine spiral artery remodelling are important for lowering maternal vascular resistance and increasing uteroplacental blood flow. Impaired spiral artery remodelling has been implicated in pre-eclampsia, a major complication of pregnancy, for a long time but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Corin (also known as atrial natriuretic peptide-converting enzyme) is a cardiac protease that activates atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a cardiac hormone that is important in regulating blood pressure. Unexpectedly, corin expression was detected in the pregnant uterus. Here we identify a new function of corin and ANP in promoting trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodelling. We show that pregnant corin- or ANP-deficient mice developed high blood pressure and proteinuria, characteristics of pre-eclampsia. In these mice, trophoblast invasion and uterine spiral artery remodelling were markedly impaired. Consistent with this, the ANP potently stimulated human trophoblasts in invading Matrigels. In patients with pre-eclampsia, uterine Corin messenger RNA and protein levels were significantly lower than that in normal pregnancies. Moreover, we have identified Corin gene mutations in pre-eclamptic patients, which decreased corin activity in processing pro-ANP. These results indicate that corin and ANP are essential for physiological changes at the maternal-fetal interface, suggesting that defects in corin and ANP function may contribute to pre-eclampsia.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

21651769,Pontine Tegmental Cap Dysplasia: developmental and cognitive outcome in three adolescent patients.,"Pontine Tegmental Cap Dysplasia (PTCD) is a recently described, rare disorder characterized by a peculiar cerebellar and brainstem malformation. Nineteen patients have been reported to date, of which only one in the adolescent age, and data on the clinical, cognitive and behavioural outcome of this syndrome are scarce. Here we describe three adolescent patients with PTCD. All presented bilateral deafness and multiple cranial neuropathies, variably associated with skeletal, cardiac and gastro-intestinal malformations. Feeding and swallowing difficulties, that are often causative of recurrent aspiration pneumonias and death in the first years of life, completely resolved with age in all three patients. Neuropsychological assessment showed borderline to moderate cognitive impairment, with delay in adaptive functioning, visual-spatial and language deficits. Two of three patients also showed mild behavioural problems, although their overall socialization abilities were well preserved. Cochlear implantation in two patients significantly improved their relational and learning abilities. Fibre tractography confirmed the abnormal bundle of transversely oriented fibres forming the typical pontine ""tegmental cap"" and absence of decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles, supporting the hypothesis that PTCD results from abnormal axonal guidance and/or migration.These data indicate that PTCD may have a favourable long-term outcome, with borderline cognitive deficit or even normal cognition and partially preserved speech.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"

22742743,Mutations in DPAGT1 cause a limb-girdle congenital myasthenic syndrome with tubular aggregates.,"Congenital myasthenic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders that arise from impaired signal transmission at the neuromuscular synapse. They are characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. We performed whole-exome sequencing to determine the underlying defect in a group of individuals with an inherited limb-girdle pattern of myasthenic weakness. We identify DPAGT1 as a gene in which mutations cause a congenital myasthenic syndrome. We describe seven different mutations found in five individuals with DPAGT1 mutations. The affected individuals share a number of common clinical features, including involvement of proximal limb muscles, response to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and 3,4-diaminopyridine, and the presence of tubular aggregates in muscle biopsies. Analyses of motor endplates from two of the individuals demonstrate a severe reduction of endplate acetylcholine receptors. DPAGT1 is an essential enzyme catalyzing the first committed step of N-linked protein glycosylation. Our findings underscore the importance of N-linked protein glycosylation for proper functioning of the neuromuscular junction. Using the DPAGT1-specific inhibitor tunicamycin, we show that DPAGT1 is required for efficient glycosylation of acetylcholine-receptor subunits and for efficient export of acetylcholine receptors to the cell surface. We suggest that the primary pathogenic mechanism of DPAGT1 mutations is reduced levels of acetylcholine receptors at the endplate region. These individuals share clinical features similar to those of congenital myasthenic syndrome due to GFPT1 mutations, and their disorder might be part of a larger subgroup comprising the congenital myasthenic syndromes that result from defects in the N-linked glycosylation pathway and that manifest through impaired neuromuscular transmission.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article"
22863194,Exome sequencing identifies FUS mutations as a cause of essential tremor.,"Essential tremor (ET) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a postural or motion tremor. Despite a strong genetic basis, a gene with rare pathogenic mutations that cause ET has not yet been reported. We used exome sequencing to implement a simple approach to control for misdiagnosis of ET, as well as phenocopies involving sporadic and senile ET cases. We studied a large ET-affected family and identified a FUS p.Gln290(∗) mutation as the cause of ET in this family. Further screening of 270 ET cases identified two additional rare missense FUS variants. Functional considerations suggest that the pathogenic effects of ET-specific FUS mutations are different from the effects observed when FUS is mutated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases; we have shown that the ET FUS nonsense mutation is degraded by the nonsense-mediated-decay pathway, whereas amyotrophic lateral sclerosis FUS mutant transcripts are not.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
22801503,Mutations in the profilin 1 gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder resulting from motor neuron death. Approximately 10% of cases are familial (FALS), typically with a dominant inheritance mode. Despite numerous advances in recent years, nearly 50% of FALS cases have unknown genetic aetiology. Here we show that mutations within the profilin 1 (PFN1) gene can cause FALS. PFN1 is crucial for the conversion of monomeric (G)-actin to filamentous (F)-actin. Exome sequencing of two large ALS families showed different mutations within the PFN1 gene. Further sequence analysis identified 4 mutations in 7 out of 274 FALS cases. Cells expressing PFN1 mutants contain ubiquitinated, insoluble aggregates that in many cases contain the ALS-associated protein TDP-43. PFN1 mutants also display decreased bound actin levels and can inhibit axon outgrowth. Furthermore, primary motor neurons expressing mutant PFN1 display smaller growth cones with a reduced F/G-actin ratio. These observations further document that cytoskeletal pathway alterations contribute to ALS pathogenesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25163805,Further delineation of Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 4 in a family with mild vascular involvement and a TGFB2 splicing mutation.,"BACKGROUND: The Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection and widespread systemic connective tissue involvement. LDS type 1 to 4 are caused by mutations in genes of the TGF-β signaling pathway: TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 encoding the TGF-β receptor (LDS1 and LDS2), SMAD3 encoding the TGF-β receptor cytoplasmic effector (LDS3), and TGFB2 encoding the TGF-β2 ligand (LDS4). LDS4 represents the mildest end of the LDS spectrum, since aneurysms are usually observed in fourth decade and the progression of the disease is slower than in the other forms. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical and molecular findings of an LDS4 Italian family. Genetic testing included TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, and TGFB2 analysis by Sanger sequencing. In order to verify the effect of the identified splice mutation, RT-PCR analysis was performed.The proband, a 57-year-old woman, showed high palate, hypoplasic uvula, easy bruising, joint hypermobility, chronic pain, scoliosis, multiple relapsing hernias, dural ectasia, and mitral valve prolapse. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed tortuosity and ectasia of carotid, vertebral, cerebral, and segmental pulmonary arteries. Arterial aneurysm and dissection never occurred. Her 39- and 34-year-old daughters presented with a variable degree of musculoskeletal involvement. Molecular analysis disclosed the novel c.839-1G>A splice site mutation in the TGFB2 gene. This mutation activates a cryptic splice acceptor site in exon 6 leading to frameshift, premature termination codon and haploinsufficiency (p.Gly280Aspfs*41). CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that loss-of-function mutations in TGFB2 gene do not always lead to aggressive vascular phenotypes and that articular and skeletal signs are prevalent, therefore suggesting that LDS4 must be considered in patients with sparse signs of LDS and related disorders also in the absence of vascular events.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; case-report"
22772368,Loss-of-function mutations in TGFB2 cause a syndromic presentation of thoracic aortic aneurysm.,"Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) associates with a tissue signature for high transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling but is often caused by heterozygous mutations in genes encoding positive effectors of TGF-β signaling, including either subunit of the TGF-β receptor or SMAD3, thereby engendering controversy regarding the mechanism of disease. Here, we report heterozygous mutations or deletions in the gene encoding the TGF-β2 ligand for a phenotype within the LDS spectrum and show upregulation of TGF-β signaling in aortic tissue from affected individuals. Furthermore, haploinsufficient Tgfb2(+/-) mice have aortic root aneurysm and biochemical evidence of increased canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling. Mice that harbor both a mutant Marfan syndrome (MFS) allele (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) and Tgfb2 haploinsufficiency show increased TGF-β signaling and phenotypic worsening in association with normalization of TGF-β2 expression and high expression of TGF-β1. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that compensatory autocrine and/or paracrine events contribute to the pathogenesis of TGF-β-mediated vasculopathies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26608784,RTTN Mutations Cause Primary Microcephaly and Primordial Dwarfism in Humans.,"Primary microcephaly is a developmental brain anomaly that results from defective proliferation of neuroprogenitors in the germinal periventricular zone. More than a dozen genes are known to be mutated in autosomal-recessive primary microcephaly in isolation or in association with a more generalized growth deficiency (microcephalic primordial dwarfism), but the genetic heterogeneity is probably more extensive. In a research protocol involving autozygome mapping and exome sequencing, we recruited a multiplex consanguineous family who is affected by severe microcephalic primordial dwarfism and tested negative on clinical exome sequencing. Two candidate autozygous intervals were identified, and the second round of exome sequencing revealed a single intronic variant therein (c.2885+8A>G [p.Ser963(âˆ—)] in RTTN exon 23). RT-PCR confirmed that this change creates a cryptic splice donor and thus causes retention of the intervening 7 bp of the intron and leads to premature truncation. On the basis of this finding, we reanalyzed the exome file of a second consanguineous family affected by a similar phenotype and identified another homozygous change in RTTN as the likely causal mutation. Combined linkage analysis of the two families confirmed that RTTN maps to the only significant linkage peak. Finally, through international collaboration, a Canadian multiplex family affected by microcephalic primordial dwarfism and biallelic mutation of RTTN was identified. Our results expand the phenotype of RTTN-related disorders, hitherto limited to polymicrogyria, to include microcephalic primordial dwarfism with a complex brain phenotype involving simplified gyration.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
22939636,RTTN mutations link primary cilia function to organization of the human cerebral cortex.,"Polymicrogyria is a malformation of the developing cerebral cortex caused by abnormal organization and characterized by many small gyri and fusion of the outer molecular layer. We have identified autosomal-recessive mutations in RTTN, encoding Rotatin, in individuals with bilateral diffuse polymicrogyria from two separate families. Rotatin determines early embryonic axial rotation, as well as anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning in the mouse. Human Rotatin has recently been identified as a centrosome-associated protein. The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of Rotatin, Ana3, is needed for structural integrity of centrioles and basal bodies and maintenance of sensory neurons. We show that Rotatin colocalizes with the basal bodies at the primary cilium. Cultured fibroblasts from affected individuals have structural abnormalities of the cilia and exhibit downregulation of BMP4, WNT5A, and WNT2B, which are key regulators of cortical patterning and are expressed at the cortical hem, the cortex-organizing center that gives rise to Cajal-Retzius (CR) neurons. Interestingly, we have shown that in mouse embryos, Rotatin colocalizes with CR neurons at the subpial marginal zone. Knockdown experiments in human fibroblasts and neural stem cells confirm a role for RTTN in cilia structure and function. RTTN mutations therefore link aberrant ciliary function to abnormal development and organization of the cortex in human individuals.",brief-report; journal article
19079066,TAC3 and TACR3 mutations in familial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism reveal a key role for Neurokinin B in the central control of reproduction.,"The timely secretion of gonadal sex steroids is essential for the initiation of puberty, the postpubertal maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and the normal perinatal development of male external genitalia. Normal gonadal steroid production requires the actions of the pituitary-derived gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. We report four human pedigrees with severe congenital gonadotropin deficiency and pubertal failure in which all affected individuals are homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in TAC3 (encoding Neurokinin B) or its receptor TACR3 (encoding NK3R). Neurokinin B, a member of the substance P-related tachykinin family, is known to be highly expressed in hypothalamic neurons that also express kisspeptin, a recently identified regulator of gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. These findings implicate Neurokinin B as a critical central regulator of human gonadal function and suggest new approaches to the pharmacological control of human reproduction and sex hormone-related diseases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
19535795,Isolated familial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and a GNRH1 mutation.,"We investigated whether mutations in the gene encoding gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH1) might be responsible for idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) in humans. We identified a homozygous GNRH1 frameshift mutation, an insertion of an adenine at nucleotide position 18 (c.18-19insA), in the sequence encoding the N-terminal region of the signal peptide-containing protein precursor of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (prepro-GnRH) in a teenage brother and sister, who had normosmic IHH. Their unaffected parents and a sibling who was tested were heterozygous. This mutation results in an aberrant peptide lacking the conserved GnRH decapeptide sequence, as shown by the absence of immunoreactive GnRH when expressed in vitro. This isolated autosomal recessive GnRH deficiency, reversed by pulsatile GnRH administration, shows the pivotal role of GnRH in human reproduction.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
21937992,Deep sequencing reveals 50 novel genes for recessive cognitive disorders.,"Common diseases are often complex because they are genetically heterogeneous, with many different genetic defects giving rise to clinically indistinguishable phenotypes. This has been amply documented for early-onset cognitive impairment, or intellectual disability, one of the most complex disorders known and a very important health care problem worldwide. More than 90 different gene defects have been identified for X-chromosome-linked intellectual disability alone, but research into the more frequent autosomal forms of intellectual disability is still in its infancy. To expedite the molecular elucidation of autosomal-recessive intellectual disability, we have now performed homozygosity mapping, exon enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families with autosomal-recessive intellectual disability from Iran and elsewhere. This study, the largest published so far, has revealed additional mutations in 23 genes previously implicated in intellectual disability or related neurological disorders, as well as single, probably disease-causing variants in 50 novel candidate genes. Proteins encoded by several of these genes interact directly with products of known intellectual disability genes, and many are involved in fundamental cellular processes such as transcription and translation, cell-cycle control, energy metabolism and fatty-acid synthesis, which seem to be pivotal for normal brain development and function.",review-article; review; journal article
9837814,Mutation in PEX16 is causal in the peroxisome-deficient Zellweger syndrome of complementation group D.,"Peroxisome-biogenesis disorders (PBDs), including Zellweger syndrome (ZS), are autosomal recessive diseases caused by a deficiency in peroxisome assembly as well as by a malfunction of peroxisomes, among which>10 genotypes have been identified. We have isolated a human PEX16 cDNA (HsPEX16) by performing an expressed-sequence-tag homology search on a human DNA database, by using yeast PEX16 from Yarrowia lipolytica and then screening the human liver cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a peroxisomal protein (a peroxin Pex16p) made up of 336 amino acids. Among 13 peroxisome-deficiency complementation groups (CGs), HsPEX16 expression morphologically and biochemically restored peroxisome biogenesis only in fibroblasts from a CG-D patient with ZS in Japan (the same group as CG-IX in the United States). Pex16p was localized to peroxisomes through expression study of epitope-tagged Pex16p. One patient (PBDD-01) possessed a homozygous, inactivating nonsense mutation, C-->T at position 526 in a codon (CGA) for 176Arg, that resulted in a termination codon (TGA). This implies that the C-terminal half is required for the biological function of Pex16p. PBDD-01-derived PEX16 cDNA was defective in peroxisome-restoring activity when expressed in the patient's fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that mutation in PEX16 is the genetic cause of CG-D PBDs.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
10958759,"Defective peroxisome membrane synthesis due to mutations in human PEX3 causes Zellweger syndrome, complementation group G.","Zellweger cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome is a severe congenital disorder associated with defective peroxisomal biogenesis. At least 23 PEX genes have been reported to be essential for peroxisome biogenesis in various species, indicating the complexity of peroxisomal assembly. Cells from patients with peroxisomal biogenesis disorders have previously been shown to segregate into >/=12 complementation groups. Two patients assigned to complementation group G who had not been linked previously to a specific gene defect were confirmed as displaying a cellular phenotype characterized by a lack of even residual peroxisomal membrane structures. Here we demonstrate that this complementation group is associated with mutations in the PEX3 gene, encoding an integral peroxisomal membrane protein. Homozygous PEX3 mutations, each leading to C-terminal truncation of PEX3, were identified in the two patients, who both suffered from a severe Zellweger syndrome phenotype. One of the mutations involved a single-nucleotide insertion in exon 7, whereas the other was a single-nucleotide substitution eight nucleotides from the normal splice site in the 3' acceptor site of intron 10. Expression of wild-type PEX3 in the mutant cell lines restored peroxisomal biogenesis, whereas transfection of mutated PEX3 cDNA did not. This confirmed that the causative gene had been identified. The observation of peroxisomal formation in the absence of morphologically recognizable peroxisomal membranes challenges the theory that peroxisomes arise exclusively by growth and division from preexisting peroxisomes and establishes PEX3 as a key factor in early human peroxisome synthesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; case-report"
9194444,MR of Zellweger syndrome.,"PURPOSE: To determine characteristic MR imaging features of Zellweger syndrome. METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory records, and MR studies of six patients with Zellweger syndrome were reviewed retrospectively. MR studies were examined for the state of myelination; the presence, extent, and morphologic appearance of cerebral cortical anomalies; the status of the cerebellar cortex, basal nuclei, and brain stem; and the presence or absence of any regions of abnormal signal intensity. RESULTS: The diagnosis of Zellweger syndrome was established in all patients by clinical findings combined with laboratory and MR results. All patients had impaired myelination and diffusely abnormal cortical gyral patterns that consisted of regions of microgyria (primarily in the frontal and perisylvian cortex) together with regions of thickened pachygyric cortex (primarily perirolandic and occipital). The pachygyric regions were in the form of deep cortical infoldings. Germinolytic cysts were visible in the caudothalamic groove in all patients, seen best on coronal or sagittal T1-weighted images. One patient had T1 shortening in the bilateral globus pallidus, presumably related to hepatic dysfunction and hyperbilirubinemia. CONCLUSION: The combination of hypomyelination, cortical malformations that are most severe in the perisylvian and perirolandic regions, and germinolytic cysts are highly suggestive of Zellweger syndrome in the proper clinical setting.",journal article
21524210,IRF8 mutations and human dendritic-cell immunodeficiency.,"The genetic analysis of human primary immunodeficiencies has defined the contribution of specific cell populations and molecular pathways in the host defense against infection. Disseminated infection caused by bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines is an early manifestation of primary immunodeficiencies, such as severe combined immunodeficiency. In many affected persons, the cause of disseminated BCG disease is unexplained.We evaluated an infant presenting with features of severe immunodeficiency, including early-onset disseminated BCG disease, who required hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. We also studied two otherwise healthy subjects with a history of disseminated but curable BCG disease in childhood. We characterized the monocyte and dendritic-cell compartments in these three subjects and sequenced candidate genes in which mutations could plausibly confer susceptibility to BCG disease.We detected two distinct disease-causing mutations affecting interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8). Both K108E and T80A mutations impair IRF8 transcriptional activity by disrupting the interaction between IRF8 and DNA. The K108E variant was associated with an autosomal recessive severe immunodeficiency with a complete lack of circulating monocytes and dendritic cells. The T80A variant was associated with an autosomal dominant, milder immunodeficiency and a selective depletion of CD11c+CD1c+ circulating dendritic cells.These findings define a class of human primary immunodeficiencies that affect the differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes. They also show that human IRF8 is critical for the development of monocytes and dendritic cells and for antimycobacterial immunity.

22581968,A novel defect of peroxisome division due to a homozygous non-sense mutation in the PEX11β gene.,"BACKGROUND: Peroxisomes are organelles that proliferate continuously and play an indispensable role in human metabolism. Consequently, peroxisomal gene defects can cause multiple, often severe disorders, including the peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Currently, 13 different PEX proteins have been implicated in various stages of peroxisome assembly and protein import. Defects in any of these proteins result in a peroxisome biogenesis disorder. The authors present here a novel genetic defect specifically affecting the division of peroxisomes. METHODS: The authors have studied biochemical and microscopical peroxisomal parameters in cultured patient fibroblasts, sequenced candidate PEX genes and determined the consequence of the identified PEX11β gene defect on peroxisome biogenesis in patient fibroblasts at different temperatures. RESULTS: The patient presented with congenital cataracts, mild intellectual disability, progressive hearing loss, sensory nerve involvement, gastrointestinal problems and recurrent migraine-like episodes. Although microscopical investigations of patient fibroblasts indicated a clear defect in peroxisome division, all biochemical parameters commonly used for diagnosing peroxisomal disorders were normal. After excluding mutations in all PEX genes previously implicated in peroxisome biogenesis disorders, it was found that the defect was caused by a homozygous non-sense mutation in the PEX11β gene. The peroxisome division defect was exacerbated when the patient's fibroblasts were cultured at 40°C, which correlated with a marked decrease in the expression of PEX11γ. CONCLUSIONS: This novel isolated defect in peroxisome division expands the clinical and genetic spectrum of peroxisomal disorders and indicates that peroxisomal defects exist, which cannot be diagnosed by standard laboratory investigations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
21464306,Mutations in mitochondrial histidyl tRNA synthetase HARS2 cause ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural hearing loss of Perrault syndrome.,"Perrault syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural hearing loss. In a nonconsanguineous family with five affected siblings, linkage analysis and genomic sequencing revealed the genetic basis of Perrault syndrome to be compound heterozygosity for mutations in the mitochondrial histidyl tRNA synthetase HARS2 at two highly conserved amino acids, L200V and V368L. The nucleotide substitution creating HARS2 p.L200V also created an alternate splice leading to deletion of 12 codons from the HARS2 message. Affected family members thus carried three mutant HARS2 transcripts. Aminoacylation activity of HARS2 p.V368L and HARS2 p.L200V was reduced and the deletion mutant was not stably expressed in mammalian mitochondria. In yeast, lethality of deletion of the single essential histydyl tRNA synthetase HTS1 was fully rescued by wild-type HTS1 and by HTS1 p.L198V (orthologous to HARS2 p.L200V), partially rescued by HTS1 p.V381L (orthologous to HARS2 p.V368L), and not rescued by the deletion mutant. In Caenorhabditis elegans, reduced expression by RNAi of the single essential histydyl tRNA synthetase hars-1 severely compromised fertility. Together, these data suggest that Perrault syndrome in this family was caused by reduction of HARS2 activity. These results implicate aberrations of mitochondrial translation in mammalian gonadal dysgenesis. More generally, the relationship between HARS2 and Perrault syndrome illustrates how causality may be demonstrated for extremely rare inherited mutations in essential, highly conserved genes.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23063621,Loss-of-function mutations in HOXC13 cause pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia.,"Pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia (PHNED) is a congenital condition characterized by hypotrichosis and nail dystrophy. Autosomal-recessive PHNED has previously been mapped to chromosomal region 12q12-q14.1, which contains the type II hair keratin and HOXC clusters. Hoxc13-null mice are known to develop hair and nail defects very similar to those seen in human PHNED. We performed whole-exome sequencing in a consanguineous Chinese family affected by PHNED and identified a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.390C>A [p.Tyr130(âˆ—)]) in HOXC13 in all affected individuals. In an additional affected female from a consanguineous Afghan family, we found a 27.6 kb homozygous microdeletion involving the first exon of HOXC13. We examined HOXC13 expression in scalp specimen obtained from the index individual of the Chinese family and detected dramatically reduced mRNA levels in skin tissue and nearly absent protein staining in hair follicles, suggesting a mechanism of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. We also observed markedly decreased expression of four HOXC13 target genes in the specimen. Taken together, our results demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in HOXC13 cause autosomal-recessive PHNED and further highlight the importance of HOXC13 in hair and nail development.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23315978,A homozygous frameshift mutation in the HOXC13 gene underlies pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia in a Syrian family.,"Pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia (PHNED) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypotrichosis or complete alopecia, as well as nail dystrophy. Mutations in the type II hair keratin gene KRT85 and the HOXC13 gene on chromosome 12q have recently been identified in families with autosomal-recessive PHNED. In the present study, we have analyzed a consanguineous Syrian family with an affected girl having complete alopecia and nail dystrophy since birth. The family clearly showed linkage to chromosome 12q13.13-12q14.3, which excluded the KRT85 gene. Sequencing of another candidate gene HOXC13 within the linkage interval identified a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.355delC; p.Leu119Trpfs*20). Expression studies in cultured cells revealed that the mutant HOXC13 protein mislocalized within the cytoplasm, and failed to upregulate the promoter activities of its target genes. Our results strongly suggest crucial roles of the HOXC13 gene in the development of hair and nails in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
23084290,"A mutation in PNPT1, encoding mitochondrial-RNA-import protein PNPase, causes hereditary hearing loss.","A subset of nuclear-encoded RNAs has to be imported into mitochondria for the proper replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome and, hence, for proper mitochondrial function. Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase or PNPT1) is one of the very few components known to be involved in this poorly characterized process in mammals. At the organismal level, however, the effect of PNPase dysfunction and impaired mitochondrial RNA import are unknown. By positional cloning, we identified a homozygous PNPT1 missense mutation (c.1424A>G predicting the protein substitution p.Glu475Gly) of a highly conserved PNPase residue within the second RNase-PH domain in a family affected by autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment. In vitro analyses in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells showed that the identified mutation results in a hypofunctional protein leading to disturbed PNPase trimerization and impaired mitochondrial RNA import. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong PNPase staining in the murine cochlea, including the sensory hair cells and the auditory ganglion neurons. In summary, we show that a component of the mitochondrial RNA-import machinery is specifically required for auditory function.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23161670,"Focal facial dermal dysplasia, type IV, is caused by mutations in CYP26C1.","Focal facial dermal dysplasia (FFDD) Type IV is a rare syndrome characterized by facial lesions resembling aplasia cutis in a preauricular distribution along the line of fusion of the maxillary and mandibular prominences. To identify the causative gene(s), exome sequencing was performed in a family with two affected siblings. Assuming autosomal recessive inheritance, two novel sequence variants were identified in both siblings in CYP26C1-a duplication of seven base pairs, which was maternally inherited, c.844_851dupCCATGCA, predicting p.Glu284fsX128 and a missense mutation, c.1433G>A, predicting p.Arg478His, that was paternally inherited. The duplication predicted a frameshift mutation that led to a premature stop codon and premature chain termination, whereas the missense mutation was not functional based on its in vitro expression in mammalian cells. The FFDD skin lesions arise along the sites of fusion of the maxillary and mandibular prominences early in facial development, and Cyp26c1 was expressed exactly along the fusion line for these facial prominences in the first branchial arch in mice. Sequencing of four additional, unrelated Type IV FFDD patients and eight Type II or III TWIST2-negative FFDD patients revealed that three of the Type IV patients were homozygous for the duplication, whereas none of the Type II or III patients had CYP26C1 mutations. The seven base pairs duplication was present in 0.3% of healthy controls and 0.3% of patients with other birth defects. These findings suggest that the phenotypic manifestations of FFDD Type IV can be non-penetrant or underascertained. Thus, FFDD Type IV results from the loss of function mutations in CYP26C1.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23063620,Mutations in multidomain protein MEGF8 identify a Carpenter syndrome subtype associated with defective lateralization.,"Carpenter syndrome is an autosomal-recessive multiple-congenital-malformation disorder characterized by multisuture craniosynostosis and polysyndactyly of the hands and feet; many other clinical features occur, and the most frequent include obesity, umbilical hernia, cryptorchidism, and congenital heart disease. Mutations of RAB23, encoding a small GTPase that regulates vesicular transport, are present in the majority of cases. Here, we describe a disorder caused by mutations in multiple epidermal-growth-factor-like-domains 8 (MEGF8), which exhibits substantial clinical overlap with Carpenter syndrome but is frequently associated with abnormal left-right patterning. We describe five affected individuals with similar dysmorphic facies, and three of them had either complete situs inversus, dextrocardia, or transposition of the great arteries; similar cardiac abnormalities were previously identified in a mouse mutant for the orthologous Megf8. The mutant alleles comprise one nonsense, three missense, and two splice-site mutations; we demonstrate in zebrafish that, in contrast to the wild-type protein, the proteins containing all three missense alterations provide only weak rescue of an early gastrulation phenotype induced by Megf8 knockdown. We conclude that mutations in MEGF8 cause a Carpenter syndrome subtype frequently associated with defective left-right patterning, probably through perturbation of signaling by hedgehog and nodal family members. We did not observe any subject with biallelic loss-of function mutations, suggesting that some residual MEGF8 function might be necessary for survival and might influence the phenotypes observed.",research-article; journal article
23159249,Recurrent de novo mutations in PACS1 cause defective cranial-neural-crest migration and define a recognizable intellectual-disability syndrome.,"We studied two unrelated boys with intellectual disability (ID) and a striking facial resemblance suggestive of a hitherto unappreciated syndrome. Exome sequencing in both families identified identical de novo mutations in PACS1, suggestive of causality. To support these genetic findings and to understand the pathomechanism of the mutation, we studied the protein in vitro and in vivo. Altered PACS1 forms cytoplasmic aggregates in vitro with concomitant increased protein stability and shows impaired binding to an isoform-specific variant of TRPV4, but not the full-length protein. Furthermore, consistent with the human pathology, expression of mutant PACS1 mRNA in zebrafish embryos induces craniofacial defects most likely in a dominant-negative fashion. This phenotype is driven by aberrant specification and migration of SOX10-positive cranial, but not enteric, neural-crest cells. Our findings suggest that PACS1 is necessary for the formation of craniofacial structures and that perturbation of its functions results in a specific syndromic ID phenotype.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
24998929,Disruptive CHD8 mutations define a subtype of autism early in development.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disease in which efforts to define subtypes behaviorally have met with limited success. Hypothesizing that genetically based subtype identification may prove more productive, we resequenced the ASD-associated gene CHD8 in 3,730 children with developmental delay or ASD. We identified a total of 15 independent mutations; no truncating events were identified in 8,792 controls, including 2,289 unaffected siblings. In addition to a high likelihood of an ASD diagnosis among patients bearing CHD8 mutations, characteristics enriched in this group included macrocephaly, distinct faces, and gastrointestinal complaints. chd8 disruption in zebrafish recapitulates features of the human phenotype, including increased head size as a result of expansion of the forebrain/midbrain and impairment of gastrointestinal motility due to a reduction in postmitotic enteric neurons. Our findings indicate that CHD8 disruptions define a distinct ASD subtype and reveal unexpected comorbidities between brain development and enteric innervation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review-article; review; journal article"
23109149,DPM2-CDG: a muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy syndrome with severe epilepsy.,"OBJECTIVE: Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of metabolic diseases due to defects in protein and lipid glycosylation. We searched for the primary defect in 3 children from 2 families with a severe neurological phenotype, including profound developmental delay, intractable epilepsy, progressive microcephaly, severe hypotonia with elevated blood creatine kinase levels, and early fatal outcome. There was clinical evidence of a muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy syndrome, supported by deficient O-mannosylation by muscle immunohistochemistry. METHODS: Biochemical and molecular methods were combined to pinpoint the defect in the glycosylation pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. RESULTS: Metabolic investigations revealed CDG-I, pointing to a defect in protein N-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Analysis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in fibroblasts showed accumulation of Dol-PP-GlcNAc(2) -Man(5) . DNA analysis revealed mutations in DPM2, 1 of the subunits of the dolichol-phosphate-mannose (DPM) synthase; the patient in the first family is compound heterozygous for 2 mutations (c.68A>G, predicting a missense mutation p.Y23C and c.4-1G>C, a splice mutation), whereas the patients in the second family are homozygous for the same missense mutation (c.68A>G, p.Y23C). INTERPRETATION: We describe a new CDG, due to a deficiency of DPM2. Hence, mutations have now been described in the genes for the 3 subunits of DPM: DPM1, DPM2, and DPM3, whereby DPM2-CDG links the congenital disorders of glycosylation to the congenital muscular dystrophies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
28323974,Phenotypic Spectrum in Osteogenesis Imperfecta Due to Mutations in TMEM38B: Unraveling a Complex Cellular Defect.,"Recessive mutations in TMEM38B cause type XIV osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) by dysregulating intracellular calcium flux.Clinical and bone material phenotype description and osteoblast differentiation studies.Natural history study in pediatric research centers.Eight patients with type XIV OI.Clinical examinations included bone mineral density, radiographs, echocardiography, and muscle biopsy. Bone biopsy samples (n = 3) were analyzed using histomorphometry, quantitative backscattered electron microscopy, and Raman microspectroscopy. Cellular differentiation studies were performed on proband and control osteoblasts and normal murine osteoclasts.Type XIV OI clinical phenotype ranges from asymptomatic to severe. Previously unreported features include vertebral fractures, periosteal cloaking, coxa vara, and extraskeletal features (muscular hypotonia, cardiac abnormalities). Proband lumbar spine bone density z score was reduced [median -3.3 (range -4.77 to +0.1; n = 7)] and increased by +1.7 (1.17 to 3.0; n = 3) following bisphosphonate therapy. TMEM38B mutant bone has reduced trabecular bone volume, osteoblast, and particularly osteoclast numbers, with >80% reduction in bone resorption. Bone matrix mineralization is normal and nanoporosity low. We demonstrate a complex osteoblast differentiation defect with decreased expression of early markers and increased expression of late and mineralization-related markers. Predominance of trimeric intracellular cation channel type B over type A expression in murine osteoclasts supports an intrinsic osteoclast defect underlying low bone turnover.OI type XIV has a bone histology, matrix mineralization, and osteoblast differentiation pattern that is distinct from OI with collagen defects. Probands are responsive to bisphosphonates and some show muscular and cardiovascular features possibly related to intracellular calcium flux abnormalities.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
20683927,Mutations in GDF5 presenting as semidominant brachydactyly A1.,"Brachydactyly A1 (BDA1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by shortness of all middle phalanges of the hands and toes, shortness of the proximal phalanges of the first digit, and short stature. Missense mutations in the Indian Hedgehog gene (IHH) are known to cause BDA1, and a second locus has been mapped to chromosome 5p. In a consanguineous French Canadian kindred with BDA1, both IHH and the 5p locus were excluded. Microsatellites flanking GDF5 on chromosome 20q were found to cosegregate with the disease. Sequencing of the GDF5 coding region revealed that a mildly affected individual in the family was heterozygous, and that all of the severely affected individuals were homozygous for a novel missense c.1195C>T mutation that predicts a p.Arg399Cys substitution at a highly conserved amino acid. Functional analysis demonstrated that although the p.Arg399Cys mutant is able to stimulate chondrogenesis, it is much less effective than wild-type GDF5. This data confirms genetic heterogeneity in BDA1, demonstrates that mutations upstream of IHH can result in BDA1, and shows that BDA1 can result from semidominant mutations in GDF5.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23644463,GATAD2B loss-of-function mutations cause a recognisable syndrome with intellectual disability and are associated with learning deficits and synaptic undergrowth in Drosophila.,"BACKGROUND: GATA zinc finger domain containing 2B (GATAD2B) encodes a subunit of the MeCP1-Mi-2/nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase complex involved in chromatin modification and regulation of transcription. We recently identified two de novo loss-of-function mutations in GATAD2B by whole exome sequencing in two unrelated individuals with severe intellectual disability. METHODS: To identify additional individuals with GATAD2B aberrations, we searched for microdeletions overlapping with GATAD2B in inhouse and international databases, and performed targeted Sanger sequencing of the GATAD2B locus in a selected cohort of 80 individuals based on an overlap with the clinical features in the two index cases. To address whether GATAD2B is required directly in neurones for cognition and neuronal development, we investigated the role of Drosophila GATAD2B orthologue simjang (simj) in learning and synaptic connectivity. RESULTS: We identified a third individual with a 240 kb microdeletion encompassing GATAD2B and a fourth unrelated individual with GATAD2B loss-of-function mutation. Detailed clinical description showed that all four individuals with a GATAD2B aberration had a distinctive phenotype with childhood hypotonia, severe intellectual disability, limited speech, tubular shaped nose with broad nasal tip, short philtrum, sparse hair and strabismus. Neuronal knockdown of Drosophila GATAD2B orthologue, simj, resulted in impaired learning and altered synapse morphology. CONCLUSIONS: We hereby define a novel clinically recognisable intellectual disability syndrome caused by loss-of-function of GATAD2B. Our results in Drosophila suggest that GATAD2B is required directly in neurones for normal cognitive performance and synapse development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23246288,Germline PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations in Cowden and Cowden-like syndromes.,"Cowden syndrome (CS) is a difficult-to-recognize multiple hamartoma syndrome with high risks of breast, thyroid, and other cancers. Germline mutations in PTEN on 10q23 were found to cause 85% of CS when accrued from tertiary academic centers, but prospective accrual from the community over the last 12 years has revealed a 25% PTEN mutation frequency. PTEN is the phosphatase that has been implicated in a heritable cancer syndrome and subsequently in multiple sporadic cancers and developmental processes. PTEN antagonizes the AKT1/PI3K signaling pathway and has roles in cell cycle, migration, cell polarity, and apoptosis. We report that 8 of 91 (8.8%) unrelated CS individuals without germline PTEN mutations carried 10 germline PIK3CA mutations (7 missense, 1 nonsense, and 2 indels) and 2 (2.2%) AKT1 mutations. These mutations result in significantly increased P-Thr308-AKT and increased cellular PIP3. Our observations suggest that PIK3CA and AKT1 are CS susceptibility genes.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23348503,TERT promoter mutations in familial and sporadic melanoma.,"Cutaneous melanoma occurs in both familial and sporadic forms. We investigated a melanoma-prone family through linkage analysis and high-throughput sequencing and identified a disease-segregating germline mutation in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase. The mutation creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors and ternary complex factors (TCFs) near the transcription start and, in reporter gene assays, caused up to twofold increase in transcription. We then screened the TERT promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent ultraviolet signature somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74%) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas, 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85%), and 25 of 77 (33%) primary melanomas. The majority of those mutations occurred at two positions in the TERT promoter and also generated binding motifs for Ets/TCF transcription factors.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

23472759,Mutations in LAMB1 cause cobblestone brain malformation without muscular or ocular abnormalities.,"Cobblestone brain malformation (COB) is a neuronal migration disorder characterized by protrusions of neurons beyond the first cortical layer at the pial surface of the brain. It is usually seen in association with dystroglycanopathy types of congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) and ocular abnormalities termed muscle-eye-brain disease. Here we report homozygous deleterious mutations in LAMB1, encoding laminin subunit beta-1, in two families with autosomal-recessive COB. Affected individuals displayed a constellation of brain malformations including cortical gyral and white-matter signal abnormalities, severe cerebellar dysplasia, brainstem hypoplasia, and occipital encephalocele, but they had less apparent ocular or muscular abnormalities than are typically observed in COB. LAMB1 is localized to the pial basement membrane, suggesting that defective connection between radial glial cells and the pial surface mediated by LAMB1 leads to this malformation.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23434115,ACTN1 mutations cause congenital macrothrombocytopenia.,"Congenital macrothrombocytopenia (CMTP) is a heterogeneous group of rare platelet disorders characterized by a congenital reduction of platelet counts and abnormally large platelets, for which CMTP-causing mutations are only found in approximately half the cases. We herein performed whole-exome sequencing and targeted Sanger sequencing to identify mutations that cause CMTP, in which a dominant mode of transmission had been suspected but for which no known responsible mutations have been documented. In 13 Japanese CMTP-affected pedigrees, we identified six (46%) affected by ACTN1 variants cosegregating with CMTP. In the entire cohort, ACNT1 variants accounted for 5.5% of the dominant forms of CMTP cases and represented the fourth most common cause in Japanese individuals. Individuals with ACTN1 variants presented with moderate macrothrombocytopenia with anisocytosis but were either asymptomatic or had only a modest bleeding tendency. ACTN1 encodes α-actinin-1, a member of the actin-crosslinking protein superfamily that participates in the organization of the cytoskeleton. In vitro transfection experiments in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated that altered α-actinin-1 disrupted the normal actin-based cytoskeletal structure. Moreover, transduction of mouse fetal liver-derived megakaryocytes with disease-associated ACTN1 variants caused a disorganized actin-based cytoskeleton in megakaryocytes, resulting in the production of abnormally large proplatelet tips, which were reduced in number. Our findings provide an insight into the pathogenesis of CMTP.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23499309,Mutations in WNT1 cause different forms of bone fragility.,"We report that hypofunctional alleles of WNT1 cause autosomal-recessive osteogenesis imperfecta, a congenital disorder characterized by reduced bone mass and recurrent fractures. In consanguineous families, we identified five homozygous mutations in WNT1: one frameshift mutation, two missense mutations, one splice-site mutation, and one nonsense mutation. In addition, in a family affected by dominantly inherited early-onset osteoporosis, a heterozygous WNT1 missense mutation was identified in affected individuals. Initial functional analysis revealed that altered WNT1 proteins fail to activate canonical LRP5-mediated WNT-regulated β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, osteoblasts cultured in vitro showed enhanced Wnt1 expression with advancing differentiation, indicating a role of WNT1 in osteoblast function and bone development. Our finding that homozygous and heterozygous variants in WNT1 predispose to low-bone-mass phenotypes might advance the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for congenital forms of bone fragility, as well as for common forms of age-related osteoporosis.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
23636092,Casein kinase iδ mutations in familial migraine and advanced sleep phase.,"Migraine is a common disabling disorder with a significant genetic component, characterized by severe headache and often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and light sensitivity. We identified two families, each with a distinct missense mutation in the gene encoding casein kinase Iδ (CKIδ), in which the mutation cosegregated with both the presence of migraine and advanced sleep phase. The resulting alterations (T44A and H46R) occurred in the conserved catalytic domain of CKIδ, where they caused reduced enzyme activity. Mice engineered to carry the CKIδ-T44A allele were more sensitive to pain after treatment with the migraine trigger nitroglycerin. CKIδ-T44A mice also exhibited a reduced threshold for cortical spreading depression (believed to be the physiological analog of migraine aura) and greater arterial dilation during cortical spreading depression. Astrocytes from CKIδ-T44A mice showed increased spontaneous and evoked calcium signaling. These genetic, cellular, physiological, and behavioral analyses suggest that decreases in CKIδ activity can contribute to the pathogenesis of migraine.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
15800623,Functional consequences of a CKIdelta mutation causing familial advanced sleep phase syndrome.,"Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS) is a human behavioural phenotype characterized by early sleep times and early-morning awakening. It was the first human, mendelian circadian rhythm variant to be well-characterized, and was shown to result from a mutation in a phosphorylation site within the casein kinase I (CKI)-binding domain of the human PER2 gene. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of circadian rhythm regulation in humans, we set out to identify mutations in human subjects leading to FASPS. We report here the identification of a missense mutation (T44A) in the human CKIdelta gene, which results in FASPS. This mutant kinase has decreased enzymatic activity in vitro. Transgenic Drosophila carrying the human CKIdelta-T44A gene showed a phenotype with lengthened circadian period. In contrast, transgenic mice carrying the same mutation have a shorter circadian period, a phenotype mimicking human FASPS. These results show that CKIdelta is a central component in the mammalian clock, and suggest that mammalian and fly clocks might have different regulatory mechanisms despite the highly conserved nature of their individual components.","comparative study; research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

To define the phenotype associated with a novel inherited disorder of cytosolic endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway dysfunction, we studied a series of eight patients with deficiency of N-glycanase 1.Whole-genome, whole-exome, or standard Sanger sequencing techniques were employed. Retrospective chart reviews were performed in order to obtain clinical data.All patients had global developmental delay, a movement disorder, and hypotonia. Other common findings included hypolacrima or alacrima (7/8), elevated liver transaminases (6/7), microcephaly (6/8), diminished reflexes (6/8), hepatocyte cytoplasmic storage material or vacuolization (5/6), and seizures (4/8). The nonsense mutation c.1201A>T (p.R401X) was the most common deleterious allele.NGLY1 deficiency is a novel autosomal recessive disorder of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway associated with neurological dysfunction, abnormal tear production, and liver disease.

RESULTS:In 12 individuals ages 2 to 21 years with confirmed, biallelic, pathogenic NGLY1 mutations, we identified previously unreported clinical features, including optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, and lower than predicted resting energy expenditure. Novel laboratory findings include low cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) total protein and albumin and unusually high antibody titers toward rubella and/or rubeola following vaccination. We also confirmed and further quantified previously reported findings noting that decreased tear production, transient transaminitis, small feet, a complex hyperkinetic movement disorder, and varying degrees of global developmental delay with relatively preserved socialization are the most consistent features.

25220016,"NGLY1 mutation causes neuromotor impairment, intellectual disability, and neuropathy.","N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) is a conserved enzyme that is responsible for the deglycosylation of misfolded N-glycosylated proteins in the cytoplasm prior to their proteasome-mediated degradation. Disruption of this degradation process has been associated with various neurologic diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Here, we describe two siblings with neuromotor impairment, apparent intellectual disability, corneal opacities, and neuropathy who were found to possess a novel homozygous frame-shift mutation due to a 4 base pair deletion in NGLY1 (c.1533_1536delTCAA, p.Asn511LysfsX51). We hypothesize that this mutation likely limits the capability of neuronal cells to respond to stress due to accumulation of misfolded proteins, thereby impairing their survival and resulting in progressive loss of neurological function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

Using microsatellite repeat markers in close proximity to 25 genes and loci previously associated with congenital cataracts in humans and mice, we identified five markers on chromosome 19q that cosegregated with the disease. Sequencing of LIM2, one of two candidate genes in this region, revealed a homozygous T-->G change resulting in a phenylalanine-to-valine substitution at position 105 of the protein. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first report, in humans, of cataract formation associated with a mutation in LIM2.

21797849,Two novel germline KRAS mutations: expanding the molecular and clinical phenotype.,"Noonan and Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndromes are characterized by typical dysmorphic features, cardiac defects, short stature, variable ectodermal anomalies, and intellectual disability. Both belong to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway group of disorders and clinical features overlap other related conditions, notably LEOPARD and Costello syndromes. KRAS mutations account for about 2% of reported Noonan and <5% of reported CFC cases. The mutation spectrum includes recurrent missense changes clustering in particular domains of the KRAS protein and conferring gain-of-function. We report three patients from two unrelated families with novel missense KRAS mutations, p.K147E and p.Y71H. Both mutations affect a residue which is highly conserved in KRAS and other RAS isoforms. One of the families includes a mother and son pair who represent the first report of a vertically transmitted KRAS mutation. In addition, the mother and son pair had peripheral neuropathy, complicated by Charcot arthropathy in the mother. An unusual phenotypic effect of the specific KRAS mutation or a coincidence of two independent disorders may be considered. KRAS mutation-associated phenotypes appear to be subject to considerable clinical heterogeneity. All three cases highlight the challenges of clinical assessment in KRAS mutation-positive patients, and the utility of molecular testing as an adjunct to diagnosis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
18042262,Mutation and phenotypic spectrum in patients with cardio-facio-cutaneous and Costello syndrome.,"Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) and Costello syndrome (CS) are congenital disorders with a significant clinical overlap. The recent discovery of heterozygous mutations in genes encoding components of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway in both CFC and CS suggested a similar underlying pathogenesis of these two disorders. While CFC is heterogeneous with mutations in BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2 and KRAS, HRAS alterations are almost exclusively associated with CS. We carried out a comprehensive mutation analysis in 51 CFC-affected patients and 31 individuals with CS. Twelve different BRAF alterations were found in twenty-four patients with CFC (47.0%), two MAP2K1 mutations in five (9.8%) and two MAP2K2 sequence variations in three CFC-affected individuals (5.9%), whereas three patients had a KRAS alteration (5.9%). We identified four different missense mutations of HRAS in twenty-eight cases with CS (90.3%), while KRAS mutations were detected in two infants with a phenotype meeting criteria for CS (6.5%). In 14 informative families, we traced the parental origin of HRAS alterations and demonstrated inheritance of the mutated allele exclusively from the father, further confirming a paternal bias in the parental origin of HRAS mutations in CS. Careful clinical evaluation of patients with BRAF and MAP2K1/2 alterations revealed the presence of slight phenotypic differences regarding craniofacial features in MAP2K1- and MAP2K2-mutation positive individuals, suggesting possible genotype-phenotype correlations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23731542,Mutations in PDGFRB cause autosomal-dominant infantile myofibromatosis.,"Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is a disorder of mesenchymal proliferation characterized by the development of nonmetastasizing tumors in the skin, muscle, bone, and viscera. Occurrence within families across multiple generations is suggestive of an autosomal-dominant (AD) inheritance pattern, but autosomal-recessive (AR) modes of inheritance have also been proposed. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in members of nine unrelated families clinically diagnosed with AD IM to identify the genetic origin of the disorder. In eight of the families, we identified one of two disease-causing mutations, c.1978C>A (p.Pro660Thr) and c.1681C>T (p.Arg561Cys), in PDGFRB. Intriguingly, one family did not have either of these PDGFRB mutations but all affected individuals had a c.4556T>C (p.Leu1519Pro) mutation in NOTCH3. Our studies suggest that mutations in PDGFRB are a cause of IM and highlight NOTCH3 as a candidate gene. Further studies of the crosstalk between PDGFRB and NOTCH pathways may offer new opportunities to identify mutations in other genes that result in IM and is a necessary first step toward understanding the mechanisms of both tumor growth and regression and its targeted treatment.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16127465,Activating and deactivating mutations in the receptor interaction site of GDF5 cause symphalangism or brachydactyly type A2.,"Here we describe 2 mutations in growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) that alter receptor-binding affinities. They cause brachydactyly type A2 (L441P) and symphalangism (R438L), conditions previously associated with mutations in the GDF5 receptor bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1b (BMPR1B) and the BMP antagonist NOGGIN, respectively. We expressed the mutant proteins in limb bud micromass culture and treated ATDC5 and C2C12 cells with recombinant GDF5. Our results indicated that the L441P mutant is almost inactive. The R438L mutant, in contrast, showed increased biological activity when compared with WT GDF5. Biosensor interaction analyses revealed loss of binding to BMPR1A and BMPR1B ectodomains for the L441P mutant, whereas the R438L mutant showed normal binding to BMPR1B but increased binding to BMPR1A, the receptor normally activated by BMP2. The binding to NOGGIN was normal for both mutants. Thus, the brachydactyly type A2 phenotype (L441P) is caused by inhibition of the ligand-receptor interaction, whereas the symphalangism phenotype (R438L) is caused by a loss of receptor-binding specificity, resulting in a gain of function by the acquisition of BMP2-like properties. The presented experiments have identified some of the main determinants of GDF5 receptor-binding specificity in vivo and open new prospects for generating antagonists and superagonists of GDF5.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
16892395,A novel mutation in GDF5 causes autosomal dominant symphalangism in two Chinese families.,"Proximal symphalangism (SYM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ankylosis of the proximal interphalangeal joints and fusion of carpal and tarsal bones. We identified and characterized two five-generation Chinese families with SYM1. The two families share some similarities (e.g., osseous fusion of interphalangeal joints of the 2-4 fingers) with SYM1 families with mutations in the NOG gene or the family with mutation R438L recently reported in the GDF5 gene (encoding a bone morphogenetic protein family member). However, they show some unique features including the absence of cuboid bone, the lack of shortness of the first and fifth metacarpal bones, and manifestation of flat feet. Genome-wide linkage analysis of the two families mapped the disease gene to marker D20S112 with a combined LOD score of 4.32. Mutational analysis revealed a novel E491K mutation in the GDF5 gene in both families. The mutation occurs at a highly conserved residue in the TGF-beta domain of GDF5 and represents the second GDF5 mutation identified for SYM1 to date. The E491K mutation co-segregated with the affected individuals in the two families, and did not exist in unaffected family members or 200 normal controls. These results indicate that defects in GDF5 can cause SYM1 in the Chinese population, and expand the spectrum of clinical phenotypes associated with mutant GDF5.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
32767731,Perrault syndrome: Clinical report and retrospective analysis.,"BACKGROUND:Perrault syndrome (PRLTS4; OMIM# 615300) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder and only a few cases have been reported worldwide. We report a Chinese female characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and premature ovarian insufficiency. METHODS:We evaluated audiological, endocrine, and ultrasound examinations and examined the genetic causes using whole-exome sequencing. We reviewed the literature to discuss the pathogenesis, genotype-phenotype correlation, treatment, and prevention of PRLTS4. RESULTS:Bioinformatic analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the LARS2 gene, c.880G>A (p.Glu294Lys), and c.2108T>C (p.Ile703Thr) which is a novel missense mutation, co-segregated in this family. Taken together, the patient was clinically diagnosed as PRLTS4. The literature review showed that the phenotype for PRLTS4 varies widely, but the sensorineural hearing loss, increased gonadotropin levels, and amenorrhea occurred frequently. All reported mutations are highly conserved in mammals based on conservation analysis, and there is a mutation hotspot for PRLTS4. CONCLUSION:This study expanded the mutation spectrum of LARS2 and is the first report of PRLTS4 in a Chinese family. Genetic testing plays an important role in early diagnosis of syndromic deafness and clinical genetic evaluation is essential to guide prevention.",journal article
23738509,Central precocious puberty caused by mutations in the imprinted gene MKRN3.,"BACKGROUND:The onset of puberty is first detected as an increase in pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis results in central precocious puberty. The timing of pubertal development is driven in part by genetic factors, but only a few, rare molecular defects associated with central precocious puberty have been identified. METHODS:We performed whole-exome sequencing in 40 members of 15 families with central precocious puberty. Candidate variants were confirmed with Sanger sequencing. We also performed quantitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assays to determine levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) in the hypothalami of mice at different ages. RESULTS:We identified four novel heterozygous mutations in MKRN3, the gene encoding makorin RING-finger protein 3, in 5 of the 15 families; both sexes were affected. The mutations included three frameshift mutations, predicted to encode truncated proteins, and one missense mutation, predicted to disrupt protein function. MKRN3 is a paternally expressed, imprinted gene located in the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region (chromosome 15q11-q13). All affected persons inherited the mutations from their fathers, a finding that indicates perfect segregation with the mode of inheritance expected for an imprinted gene. Levels of Mkrn3 mRNA were high in the arcuate nucleus of prepubertal mice, decreased immediately before puberty, and remained low after puberty. CONCLUSIONS:Deficiency of MKRN3 causes central precocious puberty in humans.

26431553,Mutations in the maternally imprinted gene MKRN3 are common in familial central precocious puberty.,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE:Idiopathic central precocious puberty (iCPP) is defined as early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in the absence of identifiable central lesions. Mutations of the makorin RING finger 3 (MKRN3) gene are associated with iCPP. We aimed to assess the frequency of MKRN3 mutations in iCPP and to compare the phenotypes of patients with and without MKRN3 mutations. DESIGN:An observational study was carried out on patients recruited at pediatric hospitals in France and Italy. Forty-six index CPP cases were screened for mutations in the MKRN3 coding sequence: 28 index cases of familial cases and 18 cases did not report any familial history of CPP. The endocrine phenotype was compared between MKRN3 mutated and non-mutated patients. RESULTS:MKRN3 mutations were identified in one sporadic and 13 familial cases. We identified five new heterozygous missense mutations predicted to be deleterious for protein function and two frameshift mutations, one new and the other recurrent, predicted to result in truncated proteins. Age at puberty onset varied very little among patients with MKRN3 mutations and puberty occurred earlier in these patients than in those without MKRN3 mutations (6.0 years (5.4-6.0) vs 7.0 years (6.0-7.0), P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS:MKRN3 mutations are common in familial iCPP. MKRN3 is one of the gatekeepers of the postnatal activation of the gonadotropic axis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23746549,Mutations in KLHL40 are a frequent cause of severe autosomal-recessive nemaline myopathy.,"Nemaline myopathy (NEM) is a common congenital myopathy. At the very severe end of the NEM clinical spectrum are genetically unresolved cases of autosomal-recessive fetal akinesia sequence. We studied a multinational cohort of 143 severe-NEM-affected families lacking genetic diagnosis. We performed whole-exome sequencing of six families and targeted gene sequencing of additional families. We identified 19 mutations in KLHL40 (kelch-like family member 40) in 28 apparently unrelated NEM kindreds of various ethnicities. Accounting for up to 28% of the tested individuals in the Japanese cohort, KLHL40 mutations were found to be the most common cause of this severe form of NEM. Clinical features of affected individuals were severe and distinctive and included fetal akinesia or hypokinesia and contractures, fractures, respiratory failure, and swallowing difficulties at birth. Molecular modeling suggested that the missense substitutions would destabilize the protein. Protein studies showed that KLHL40 is a striated-muscle-specific protein that is absent in KLHL40-associated NEM skeletal muscle. In zebrafish, klhl40a and klhl40b expression is largely confined to the myotome and skeletal muscle, and knockdown of these isoforms results in disruption of muscle structure and loss of movement. We identified KLHL40 mutations as a frequent cause of severe autosomal-recessive NEM and showed that it plays a key role in muscle development and function. Screening of KLHL40 should be a priority in individuals who are affected by autosomal-recessive NEM and who present with prenatal symptoms and/or contractures and in all Japanese individuals with severe NEM.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25124994,Further evidence of the importance of RIT1 in Noonan syndrome.,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder consisting of short stature, short and/or webbed neck, distinctive facial features, cardiac abnormalities, cryptorchidism, and coagulation defects. NS exhibits genetic heterogeneity, associated with mutated genes that participate in RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction. Recently, a new gene (RIT1) was discovered as the causative gene in 17 of 180 Japanese individuals who were negative for the previously known genes for NS and were studied using exome sequencing (four patients), followed by Sanger sequencing (13 patients). The present study used the same technique in 70 Brazilian patients with NS and identified six with RIT1 missense mutations. Thus, we confirm that RIT1 is responsible for approximately 10% of the patients negative for mutations in the previously known genes. The phenotype includes a high frequency of high birth weight, relative macrocephaly, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ectodermal findings, such as curly hair, hyperpigmentation, and wrinkled palms and soles. Short stature and pectus deformity were less frequent. The majority of patients with a RIT1 mutation did not show apparent intellectual disability. Because of the relatively high frequency of mutations in RIT1 among patients with NS and its occurrence in different populations, we suggest that it should be added to the list of genes included in panels for the molecular diagnosis of NS through targeted next-generation sequencing.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
23307924,Contribution of growth differentiation factor 6-dependent cell survival to early-onset retinal dystrophies.,"Retinal dystrophies are predominantly caused by mutations affecting the visual phototransduction system and cilia, with few genes identified that function to maintain photoreceptor survival. We reasoned that growth factors involved with early embryonic retinal development would represent excellent candidates for such diseases. Here we show that mutations in the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) ligand Growth Differentiation Factor 6, which specifies the dorso-ventral retinal axis, contribute to Leber congenital amaurosis. Furthermore, deficiency of gdf6 results in photoreceptor degeneration, so demonstrating a connection between Gdf6 signaling and photoreceptor survival. In addition, in both murine and zebrafish mutant models, we observe retinal apoptosis, a characteristic feature of human retinal dystrophies. Treatment of gdf6-deficient zebrafish embryos with a novel aminopropyl carbazole, P7C3, rescued the retinal apoptosis without evidence of toxicity. These findings implicate for the first time perturbed TGF-β signaling in the genesis of retinal dystrophies, support the study of related morphogenetic genes for comparable roles in retinal disease and may offer additional therapeutic opportunities for genetically heterogeneous disorders presently only treatable with gene therapy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19808477,Mutations in sodium channel β1- and β2-subunits associated with atrial fibrillation.,"We and others have reported mutations in the cardiac predominant sodium channel gene SCN5A in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We also have reported that SCN1B is associated with Brugada syndrome and isolated cardiac conduction disease. We tested the hypothesis that mutations in the 4 sodium channel beta-subunit genes SCN1B-SCN4B contribute to AF susceptibility.Screening for mutations in the 4 beta-subunit genes was performed in 480 patients with AF (118 patients with lone AF and 362 patients with AF and cardiovascular disease) and 548 control subjects (188 ethnically defined anonymized subjects and 360 subjects without AF). The effects of mutant beta-subunits on SCN5A mediated currents were studied using electrophysiological studies. We identified 2 nonsynonymous variants in SCN1B (resulting in R85H, D153N) and 2 in SCN2B (R28Q, R28W) in patients with AF. These occur at residues highly conserved across mammals and were absent in control subjects. In 3 of 4 mutation carriers, the ECGs showed saddleback-type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads. Transcripts encoding both SCN1B and SCN2B were detected in human atrium and ventricle. In heterologous expression studies using Chinese hamster ovary cells, the mutant beta1- or beta2-subunits reduced SCN5A-mediated current and altered channel gating compared with coexpression of wild-type subunits.Loss of function mutations in sodium channel beta-subunits were identified in patients with AF and were associated with a distinctive ECG phenotype. These findings further support the hypothesis that decreased sodium current enhances AF susceptibility.",review-article; review; journal article
23519333,Mutations in ABCB6 cause dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria.,"Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) is a pigmentary genodermatosis characterized by a mixture of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules distributed randomly over the body. No causative genes have been reported to date. In this study, we investigated a large five-generation Chinese family with DUH. After excluding the two known DUH loci, we performed genome-wide linkage analysis and identified a DUH locus on chromosome 2q33.3-q36.1 with a maximum LOD score of 3.49 with marker D2S2382. Exome sequencing identified a c.1067T>C (p.Leu356Pro) mutation in exon 3 of ABCB6 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 6) in the DUH family. Two additional missense mutations, c.508A>G (p.Ser170Gly) in exon 1 and c.1736G>A (p.Gly579Glu) in exon 12 of ABCB6, were found in two out of six patients by mutational screening using sporadic DUH patients. Immunohistologic examination in biopsy specimens showed that ABCB6 is expressed in the epidermis and had a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Examination of subcellular localization of wild-type ABCB6 in a B16 mouse melanoma cell line revealed that it is localized to the endosome-like compartment and dendrite tips, whereas disease-causing mutations of ABCB6 resulted in its retention in the Golgi apparatus. Our studies identified ABCB6 as the first pathogenic gene associated with DUH. These findings suggest that ABCB6 may be a physiological factor for skin pigmentation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
23315541,"Mutations of NANOS1, a human homologue of the Drosophila morphogen, are associated with a lack of germ cells in testes or severe oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia.","BACKGROUND: The Nanos gene is a key translational regulator of specific mRNAs involved in Drosophila germ cell development. Disruption of mammalian homologues, Nanos2 or Nanos3, causes male infertility in mice. In humans, however, no evidence of NANOS2 or NANOS3 mutations causing male infertility has been reported. Although Nanos1 seems dispensable for mouse reproduction, we sought to analyse for the first time its homologue in infertile men. METHODS: A group of 195 patients manifesting non-obstructive azoospermia or oligozoospermia were tested for mutations of the NANOS1 gene, using single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Three types of NANOS1 gene mutations were identified in five patients and were absent in 800 chromosomes of fertile men. Pedigree analysis indicated a dominant inheritance pattern with penetration limited to males. Two mutations caused deletions of single amino acids, p.Pro77_Ser78delinsPro and p.Ala173del, each of them identified in two unrelated patients. Both types of deletions were located in the NANOS1 N-terminus (responsible for protein interactions) and were associated with a lack of germ cells in testes. Interestingly, the Pro77_Ser78delinsPro mutation altered interaction of NANOS1 with a microRNA biogenesis factor, GEMIN3. The third identified mutation, p.[(Arg246His; Arg276Tyr)], found in the C-terminal RNA-binding domain, was present in a single oligo-astheno-teratozoospermic man. We bioinformatically demonstrated that the p.Arg246His substitution causes a decrease in the positive charge of this domain, potentially altering RNA-binding. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report describing the association of NANOS1 gene mutations with human infertility. Two different infertility phenotypes may reflect distinct functions of N-terminal versus C-terminal regions of NANOS1.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
23455423,Mutations in prion-like domains in hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 cause multisystem proteinopathy and ALS.,"Algorithms designed to identify canonical yeast prions predict that around 250 human proteins, including several RNA-binding proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease, harbour a distinctive prion-like domain (PrLD) enriched in uncharged polar amino acids and glycine. PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. However, the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is not understood. Here we define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1 in families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone, and in one case of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wild-type hnRNPA2 (the most abundant isoform of hnRNPA2B1) and hnRNPA1 show an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a 'steric zipper' motif in the PrLD, which accelerates the formation of self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Notably, the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization caused by a potent mutant steric zipper motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with PrLDs should therefore be considered candidates for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone.",research-article; journal article
23830514,Mutations in LRPAP1 are associated with severe myopia in humans.,"Myopia is an extremely common eye disorder but the pathogenesis of its isolated form, which accounts for the overwhelming majority of cases, remains poorly understood. There is strong evidence for genetic predisposition to myopia, but determining myopia genetic risk factors has been difficult to achieve. We have identified Mendelian forms of myopia in four consanguineous families and implemented exome/autozygome analysis to identify homozygous truncating variants in LRPAP1 and CTSH as the likely causal mutations. LRPAP1 encodes a chaperone of LRP1, which is known to influence TGF-β activity. Interestingly, we observed marked deficiency of LRP1 and upregulation of TGF-β in cells from affected individuals, the latter being consistent with available data on the role of TGF-β in the remodeling of the sclera in myopia and the high frequency of myopia in individuals with Marfan syndrome who characteristically have upregulation of TGF-β signaling. CTSH, on the other hand, encodes a protease and we show that deficiency of the murine ortholog results in markedly abnormal globes consistent with the observed human phenotype. Our data highlight a role for LRPAP1 and CTSH in myopia genetics and demonstrate the power of Mendelian forms in illuminating new molecular mechanisms that may be relevant to common phenotypes.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
22607940,Identification of a mutation in LARS as a novel cause of infantile hepatopathy.,"Infantile hepatopathies are life-threatening liver disorders that manifest in the first few months of life. We report on a consanguineous Irish Traveller family that includes six individuals presenting with acute liver failure in the first few months of life. Additional symptoms include anaemia, renal tubulopathy, developmental delay, seizures, failure to thrive and deterioration of liver function with minor illness. The multisystem manifestations suggested a possible mitochondrial basis to the disorder. However, known causes of childhood liver failure and mitochondrial disease were excluded in this family by biochemical, metabolic and genetic analyses. We aimed to identify the underlying risk gene using homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing. SNP homozygosity mapping identified a candidate locus at 5q31.3-q33.1. Whole exome sequencing identified 1 novel homozygous missense mutation within the 5q31.3-q33.1 candidate region that segregated with the hepatopathy. The candidate mutation is located in the LARS gene which encodes a cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme responsible for exclusively attaching leucine to its cognate tRNA during protein translation. Knock-down of LARS in HEK293 cells did not impact on mitochondrial function even when the cells were put under physiological stress. The molecular studies confirm the findings of the patients' biochemical and genetic analyses which show that the hepatopathy is not a mitochondrial-based dysfunction problem, despite clinical appearances. This study highlights the clinical utility of homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in diagnosing recessive liver disorders. It reports mutation of a cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme as a possible novel cause of infantile hepatopathy and underscores the need to consider mutations in LARS in patients with liver disease and multisystem presentations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
22422768,"Absence of triadin, a protein of the calcium release complex, is responsible for cardiac arrhythmia with sudden death in human.","Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease so far related to mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR2) or the cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) genes. Because mutations in RYR2 or in CASQ2 are not retrieved in all CPVT cases, we searched for mutations in the physiological protein partners of RyR2 and CSQ2 in a large cohort of CPVT patients with no detected mutation in these two genes. Based on a candidate gene approach, we focused our investigations on triadin and junctin, two proteins that link RyR2 and CSQ2. Mutations in the triadin (TRDN) and in the junctin (ASPH) genes were searched in a cohort of 97 CPVT patients. We identified three mutations in triadin which cosegregated with the disease on a recessive mode of transmission in two families, but no mutation was found in junctin. Two TRDN mutations, a 4 bp deletion and a nonsense mutation, resulted in premature stop codons; the third mutation, a p.T59R missense mutation, was further studied. Expression of the p.T59R mutant in COS-7 cells resulted in intracellular retention and degradation of the mutant protein. This was confirmed after in vivo expression of the mutant triadin in triadin knock-out mice by viral transduction. In this work, we identified TRDN as a new gene responsible for an autosomal recessive form of CPVT. The mutations identified in the two families lead to the absence of the protein, thereby demonstrating the importance of triadin for the normal function of the cardiac calcium release complex in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
23746550,De novo mutations in the genome organizer CTCF cause intellectual disability.,"An increasing number of genes involved in chromatin structure and epigenetic regulation has been implicated in a variety of developmental disorders, often including intellectual disability. By trio exome sequencing and subsequent mutational screening we now identified two de novo frameshift mutations and one de novo missense mutation in CTCF in individuals with intellectual disability, microcephaly, and growth retardation. Furthermore, an individual with a larger deletion including CTCF was identified. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is one of the most important chromatin organizers in vertebrates and is involved in various chromatin regulation processes such as higher order of chromatin organization, enhancer function, and maintenance of three-dimensional chromatin structure. Transcriptome analyses in all three individuals with point mutations revealed deregulation of genes involved in signal transduction and emphasized the role of CTCF in enhancer-driven expression of genes. Our findings indicate that haploinsufficiency of CTCF affects genomic interaction of enhancers and their regulated gene promoters that drive developmental processes and cognition.",research-article; review; journal article
23972370,BMP9 mutations cause a vascular-anomaly syndrome with phenotypic overlap with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), the most common inherited vascular disorder, is caused by mutations in genes involved in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway (ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4). Yet, approximately 15% of individuals with clinical features of HHT do not have mutations in these genes, suggesting that there are undiscovered mutations in other genes for HHT and possibly vascular disorders with overlapping phenotypes. The genetic etiology for 191 unrelated individuals clinically suspected to have HHT was investigated with the use of exome and Sanger sequencing; these individuals had no mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4. Mutations in BMP9 (also known as GDF2) were identified in three unrelated probands. These three individuals had epistaxis and dermal lesions that were described as telangiectases but whose location and appearance resembled lesions described in some individuals with RASA1-related disorders (capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome). Analyses of the variant proteins suggested that mutations negatively affect protein processing and/or function, and a bmp9-deficient zebrafish model demonstrated that BMP9 is involved in angiogenesis. These data confirm a genetic cause of a vascular-anomaly syndrome that has phenotypic overlap with HHT.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
24136356,Phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ gene mutation predisposes to respiratory infection and airway damage.,"Genetic mutations cause primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) that predispose to infections. Here, we describe activated PI3K-δ syndrome (APDS), a PID associated with a dominant gain-of-function mutation in which lysine replaced glutamic acid at residue 1021 (E1021K) in the p110δ protein, the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ), encoded by the PIK3CD gene. We found E1021K in 17 patients from seven unrelated families, but not among 3346 healthy subjects. APDS was characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, progressive airway damage, lymphopenia, increased circulating transitional B cells, increased immunoglobulin M, and reduced immunoglobulin G2 levels in serum and impaired vaccine responses. The E1021K mutation enhanced membrane association and kinase activity of p110δ. Patient-derived lymphocytes had increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphorylated AKT protein and were prone to activation-induced cell death. Selective p110δ inhibitors IC87114 and GS-1101 reduced the activity of the mutant enzyme in vitro, which suggested a therapeutic approach for patients with APDS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Here we report fourteen patients from seven families who were heterozygous for three different germline, gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CD (which encodes p110δ). These patients presented with sinopulmonary infections, lymphadenopathy, nodular lymphoid hyperplasia and viremia due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and/or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Strikingly, they had a substantial deficiency in naive T cells but an over-representation of senescent effector T cells. In vitro, T cells from patients exhibited increased phosphorylation of the kinase Akt and hyperactivation of the metabolic checkpoint kinase mTOR, enhanced glucose uptake and terminal effector differentiation. Notably, treatment with rapamycin to inhibit mTOR activity in vivo partially restored the abundance of naive T cells, largely 'rescued' the in vitro T cell defects and improved the clinical course.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23065719,A homozygous missense mutation in HERC2 associated with global developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder.,"We studied a unique phenotype of cognitive delay, autistic behavior, and gait instability segregating in three separate sibships. We initiated genome-wide mapping in two sibships using Affymetrix 10K SNP Mapping Arrays and identified a homozygous 8.2 Mb region on chromosome 15 common to five affected children. We used exome sequencing of two affected children to assess coding sequence variants within the mapped interval. Four novel homozygous exome variants were shared between the two patients; however, only two variants localized to the mapped interval on chromosome 15. A third sibship in an Ohio Amish deme narrowed the mapped interval to 2.6 Mb and excluded one of the two novel homozygous exome variants. The remaining variant, a missense change in HERC2 (c.1781C>T, p.Pro594Leu), occurs in a highly conserved proline residue within an RCC1-like functional domain. Functional studies of truncated HERC2 in adherent retinal pigment epithelium cells suggest that the p.Pro594Leu variant induces protein aggregation and leads to decreased HERC2 abundance. The phenotypic correlation with the mouse Herc1 and Herc2 mutants as well as the phenotypic overlap with Angelman syndrome provide further evidence that pathogenic changes in HERC2 are associated with nonsyndromic intellectual disability, autism, and gait disturbance.

Given the essential role of this hormonal system in breast physiology, we reasoned that genetic anomalies of Prl/PrlR genes may be related to the occurrence of breast diseases with high proliferative potential. Multiple fibroadenomas (MFA) are benign breast tumors which appear most frequently in young women, including at puberty, when Prl has well-recognized proliferative actions on the breast. In a prospective study involving 74 MFA patients and 170 control subjects, we identified four patients harboring a heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 6 of the PrlR gene, encoding Ile(146)-->Leu substitution in its extracellular domain. This sole substitution was sufficient to confer constitutive activity to the receptor variant (PrlR(I146L)), as assessed in three reconstituted cell models (Ba/F3, HEK293 and MCF-7 cells) by Prl-independent (i) PrlR tyrosine phosphorylation, (ii) activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling, (iii) transcriptional activity toward a Prl-responsive reporter gene, and (iv) cell proliferation and protection from cell death. Constitutive activity of PrlR(I146L) in the breast sample from a patient was supported by increased STAT5 signaling. This is a unique description of a functional mutation of the PrlR associated with a human disease. Hallmarks of constitutive activity were all reversed by a specific PrlR antagonist, which opens potential therapeutic approaches for MFA, or any other disease that could be associated with this mutation in future.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
24207122,A dominant mutation in FBXO38 causes distal spinal muscular atrophy with calf predominance.,"Spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders characterized by degeneration of anterior horn cells and progressive muscle weakness. In two unrelated families affected by a distinct form of autosomal-dominant distal SMA initially manifesting with calf weakness, we identified by genetic linkage analysis and exome sequencing a heterozygous missense mutation, c.616T>C (p.Cys206Arg), in F-box protein 38 (FBXO38). FBXO38 is a known coactivator of the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 7 (KLF7), which regulates genes required for neuronal axon outgrowth and repair. The p.Cys206Arg substitution did not alter the subcellular localization of FBXO38 but did impair KLF7-mediated transactivation of a KLF7-responsive promoter construct and endogenous KLF7 target genes in both heterologously expressing human embryonic kidney 293T cells and fibroblasts derived from individuals with the FBXO38 missense mutation. This transcriptional dysregulation was associated with an impairment of neurite outgrowth in primary motor neurons. Together, these results suggest that a transcriptional regulatory pathway that has a well-established role in axonal development could also be critical for neuronal maintenance and highlight the importance of FBXO38 and KLF7 activity in motor neurons.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25835445,"Mutations in a TGF-β ligand, TGFB3, cause syndromic aortic aneurysms and dissections.","Aneurysms affecting the aorta are a common condition associated with high mortality as a result of aortic dissection or rupture. Investigations of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in syndromic types of thoracic aortic aneurysms, such as Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes, have revealed an important contribution of disturbed transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling.This study sought to discover a novel gene causing syndromic aortic aneurysms in order to unravel the underlying pathogenesis.We combined genome-wide linkage analysis, exome sequencing, and candidate gene Sanger sequencing in a total of 470 index cases with thoracic aortic aneurysms. Extensive cardiological examination, including physical examination, electrocardiography, and transthoracic echocardiography was performed. In adults, imaging of the entire aorta using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was done.Here, we report on 43 patients from 11 families with syndromic presentations of aortic aneurysms caused by TGFB3 mutations. We demonstrate that TGFB3 mutations are associated with significant cardiovascular involvement, including thoracic/abdominal aortic aneurysm and dissection, and mitral valve disease. Other systemic features overlap clinically with Loeys-Dietz, Shprintzen-Goldberg, and Marfan syndromes, including cleft palate, bifid uvula, skeletal overgrowth, cervical spine instability and clubfoot deformity. In line with previous observations in aortic wall tissues of patients with mutations in effectors of TGF-β signaling (TGFBR1/2, SMAD3, and TGFB2), we confirm a paradoxical up-regulation of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling in association with up-regulation of the expression of TGF-β ligands.Our findings emphasize the broad clinical variability associated with TGFB3 mutations and highlight the importance of early recognition of the disease because of high cardiovascular risk.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23897980,Inherited human OX40 deficiency underlying classic Kaposi sarcoma of childhood.,"Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8; also called KSHV)-induced endothelial tumor, develops only in a small fraction of individuals infected with HHV-8. We hypothesized that inborn errors of immunity to HHV-8 might underlie the exceedingly rare development of classic KS in childhood. We report here autosomal recessive OX40 deficiency in an otherwise healthy adult with childhood-onset classic KS. OX40 is a co-stimulatory receptor expressed on activated T cells. Its ligand, OX40L, is expressed on various cell types, including endothelial cells. We found OX40L was abundantly expressed in KS lesions. The mutant OX40 protein was poorly expressed on the cell surface and failed to bind OX40L, resulting in complete functional OX40 deficiency. The patient had a low proportion of effector memory CD4(+) T cells in the peripheral blood, consistent with impaired CD4(+) T cell responses to recall antigens in vitro. The proportion of effector memory CD8(+) T cells was less diminished. The proportion of circulating memory B cells was low, but the antibody response in vivo was intact, including the response to a vaccine boost. Together, these findings suggest that human OX40 is necessary for robust CD4(+) T cell memory and confers apparently selective protective immunity against HHV-8 infection in endothelial cells.",review-article; review; journal article
20156905,Classic Kaposi sarcoma in 3 unrelated Turkish children born to consanguineous kindreds.,"Infection by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) in childhood is common in the Mediterranean basin; however, classic Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is exceedingly rare in children not infected with HIV and not receiving immunosuppression, with only 30 cases having been reported since 1960. We recently reported 2 children with autosomal and X-linked recessive primary immunodeficiencies underlying KS in a context of multiple clinical manifestations. These reports suggested that classic KS in otherwise healthy children might also result from inborn errors of immunity more specific to HHV-8. In this article, we describe 3 unrelated Turkish children with classic KS born to first-cousin parents. The first patient, a girl, developed KS at 2 years of age with disseminated cutaneous and mucosal lesions. The clinical course progressed rapidly, and the patient died within 3 months despite treatment with vincristine. The other 2 children developed a milder form of KS at the age of 9 years, with multiple cutaneous lesions. A boy treated with interferon alpha therapy for 12 months is now in full remission at the age of 14, 2 years after treatment. The second girl is currently stabilized with etoposide, which was begun 4 months ago. None of the 3 children had any relevant familial history or other clinical features. The occurrence of classic KS in 3 unrelated Turkish children, each born to consanguineous parents, strongly suggests that autosomal recessive predisposition may drive the rare occurrence of HHV-8-associated classic KS in children.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23940258,Human L-ferritin deficiency is characterized by idiopathic generalized seizures and atypical restless leg syndrome.,"The ubiquitously expressed iron storage protein ferritin plays a central role in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. Cytosolic ferritins are composed of heavy (H) and light (L) subunits that co-assemble into a hollow spherical shell with an internal cavity where iron is stored. The ferroxidase activity of the ferritin H chain is critical to store iron in its Fe3+ oxidation state, while the L chain shows iron nucleation properties. We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS). We show that L chain ferritin is undetectable in primary fibroblasts from the patient, and thus ferritin consists only of H chains. Increased iron incorporation into the FtH homopolymer leads to reduced cellular iron availability, diminished levels of cytosolic catalase, SOD1 protein levels, enhanced ROS production and higher levels of oxidized proteins. Importantly, key phenotypic features observed in fibroblasts are also mirrored in reprogrammed neurons from the patient's fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate for the first time the pathophysiological consequences of L-ferritin deficiency in a human and help to define the concept for a new disease entity hallmarked by idiopathic generalized seizure and atypical RLS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
23716478,Developmental dysplasia of the hip: linkage mapping and whole exome sequencing identify a shared variant in CX3CR1 in all affected members of a large multigeneration family.,"Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a debilitating condition characterized by incomplete formation of the acetabulum leading to dislocation of the femur, suboptimal joint function, and accelerated wear of the articular cartilage resulting in arthritis. DDH affects 1 in 1000 newborns in the United States; there are well-defined ""pockets"" of high prevalence in Japan, and in Italy and other Mediterranean countries. Although reasonably accurate for detecting gross forms of hip dysplasia, existing techniques fail to find milder forms of dysplasia. Undetected hip dysplasia is the leading cause of osteoarthritis of the hip in young individuals, causing over 40% of cases in this age group. A sensitive and specific test for DDH has remained a desirable yet elusive goal in orthopedics for a long time. A 72-member, four-generation affected family has been recruited, and DNA from its members retrieved. Genomewide linkage analysis revealed a 2.61-Mb candidate region (38.7-41.31 Mb from the p term of chromosome 3) co-inherited by all affected members with a maximum logarithm (base 10) of odds (LOD) score of 3.31. Whole exome sequencing and analysis of this candidate region in four severely affected family members revealed one shared variant, rs3732378, that causes a threonine (polar) to methionine (non-polar) alteration at position 280 in the transmembrane domain of CX3CR1. This mutation is predicted to have a deleterious effect on its encoded protein, which functions as a receptor for the ligand fractalkine. By Sanger sequencing this variant was found to be present in the DNA of all affected individuals and obligate heterozygotes. CX3CR1 mediates cellular adhesive and migratory functions and is known to be expressed in mesenchymal stem cells destined to become chondrocytes. A genetic risk factor that might be among the etiologic factors for the family in this study has been identified, along with other possible aggravating mutations shared by four severely affected family members. These findings might illuminate the molecular pathways affecting chondrocyte maturation and bone formation.",journal article
15546002,Severe combined immunodeficiency caused by deficiency in either the delta or the epsilon subunit of CD3.,"We investigated the molecular mechanism underlying a severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by the selective and complete absence of T cells. The condition was found in 5 patients and 2 fetuses from 3 consanguineous families. Linkage analysis performed on the 3 families revealed that the patients were carrying homozygous haplotypes within the 11q23 region, in which the genes encoding the gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits of CD3 are located. Patients and affected fetuses from 2 families were homozygous for a mutation in the CD3D gene, and patients from the third family were homozygous for a mutation in the CD3E gene. The thymus from a CD3delta-deficient fetus was analyzed and revealed that T cell differentiation was blocked at entry into the double positive (CD4+CD8+) stage with the accumulation of intermediate CD4-single positive cells. This indicates that CD3delta plays an essential role in promoting progression of early thymocytes toward double-positive stage. Altogether, these findings extend the known molecular mechanisms underlying severe combined immunodeficiency to a new deficiency, i.e., CD3epsilon deficiency, and emphasize the essential roles played by the CD3epsilon and CD3delta subunits in human thymocyte development, since these subunits associate with both the pre-TCR and the TCR.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
24336167,Loss-of-function mutations in MICU1 cause a brain and muscle disorder linked to primary alterations in mitochondrial calcium signaling.,"Mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake has key roles in cell life and death. Physiological Ca(2+) signaling regulates aerobic metabolism, whereas pathological Ca(2+) overload triggers cell death. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is mediated by the Ca(2+) uniporter complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which comprises MCU, a Ca(2+)-selective ion channel, and its regulator, MICU1. Here we report mutations of MICU1 in individuals with a disease phenotype characterized by proximal myopathy, learning difficulties and a progressive extrapyramidal movement disorder. In fibroblasts from subjects with MICU1 mutations, agonist-induced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake at low cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations was increased, and cytosolic Ca(2+) signals were reduced. Although resting mitochondrial membrane potential was unchanged in MICU1-deficient cells, the mitochondrial network was severely fragmented. Whereas the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophy and the core myopathies involves abnormal mitochondrial Ca(2+) handling, the phenotype associated with MICU1 deficiency is caused by a primary defect in mitochondrial Ca(2+) signaling, demonstrating the crucial role of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in humans.",research-article; journal article
16575392,A gene locus responsible for reticulate pigmented anomaly of the flexures maps to chromosome 17p13.3.,"Reticulate pigmented anomaly of the flexures (RPAF), also called Dowling-Degos disease, is a rare autosomal-dominant cutaneous disorder characterized by spotted and reticulate pigmentation of the flexures. The gene, or even the chromosomal location, for RPAF has not yet been identified. In this study, one Chinese family with RPAF was identified and subjected to a genomewide screen for linkage analysis. We identified a locus at chromosome 17p13.3 with a maximum two-point limit of detection score of 3.61 at markers D17S831and D17S1866 (at recombination fraction theta=0.00). Haplotype analyses indicated that the disease gene is located within the 6.8 cM region distal to D17S1798. It is the first locus identified for RPAF. This study provides a map location for isolation of a disease gene causing RPAF.",journal article
24482476,Exome sequencing links corticospinal motor neuron disease to common neurodegenerative disorders.,"Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are neurodegenerative motor neuron diseases characterized by progressive age-dependent loss of corticospinal motor tract function. Although the genetic basis is partly understood, only a fraction of cases can receive a genetic diagnosis, and a global view of HSP is lacking. By using whole-exome sequencing in combination with network analysis, we identified 18 previously unknown putative HSP genes and validated nearly all of these genes functionally or genetically. The pathways highlighted by these mutations link HSP to cellular transport, nucleotide metabolism, and synapse and axon development. Network analysis revealed a host of further candidate genes, of which three were mutated in our cohort. Our analysis links HSP to other neurodegenerative disorders and can facilitate gene discovery and mechanistic understanding of disease.",review-article; review; journal article
24552284,Early-onset stroke and vasculopathy associated with mutations in ADA2.,"BACKGROUND:We observed a syndrome of intermittent fevers, early-onset lacunar strokes and other neurovascular manifestations, livedoid rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and systemic vasculopathy in three unrelated patients. We suspected a genetic cause because the disorder presented in early childhood. METHODS:We performed whole-exome sequencing in the initial three patients and their unaffected parents and candidate-gene sequencing in three patients with a similar phenotype, as well as two young siblings with polyarteritis nodosa and one patient with small-vessel vasculitis. Enzyme assays, immunoblotting, immunohistochemical testing, flow cytometry, and cytokine profiling were performed on samples from the patients. To study protein function, we used morpholino-mediated knockdowns in zebrafish and short hairpin RNA knockdowns in U937 cells cultured with human dermal endothelial cells. RESULTS:All nine patients carried recessively inherited mutations in CECR1 (cat eye syndrome chromosome region, candidate 1), encoding adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2), that were predicted to be deleterious; these mutations were rare or absent in healthy controls. Six patients were compound heterozygous for eight CECR1 mutations, whereas the three patients with polyarteritis nodosa or small-vessel vasculitis were homozygous for the p.Gly47Arg mutation. Patients had a marked reduction in the levels of ADA2 and ADA2-specific enzyme activity in the blood. Skin, liver, and brain biopsies revealed vasculopathic changes characterized by compromised endothelial integrity, endothelial cellular activation, and inflammation. Knockdown of a zebrafish ADA2 homologue caused intracranial hemorrhages and neutropenia - phenotypes that were prevented by coinjection with nonmutated (but not with mutated) human CECR1. Monocytes from patients induced damage in cocultured endothelial-cell layers. CONCLUSIONS:Loss-of-function mutations in CECR1 were associated with a spectrum of vascular and inflammatory phenotypes, ranging from early-onset recurrent stroke to systemic vasculopathy or vasculitis.

24552285,Mutant adenosine deaminase 2 in a polyarteritis nodosa vasculopathy.,"Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis with a pathogenesis that is poorly understood. We identified six families with multiple cases of systemic and cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. In most cases, onset of the disease occurred during childhood.We carried out exome sequencing in persons from multiply affected families of Georgian Jewish or German ancestry. We performed targeted sequencing in additional family members and in unrelated affected persons, 3 of Georgian Jewish ancestry and 14 of Turkish ancestry. Mutations were assessed by testing their effect on enzymatic activity in serum specimens from patients, analysis of protein structure, expression in mammalian cells, and biophysical analysis of purified protein.In all the families, vasculitis was caused by recessive mutations in CECR1, the gene encoding adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2). All the Georgian Jewish patients were homozygous for a mutation encoding a Gly47Arg substitution, the German patients were compound heterozygous for Arg169Gln and Pro251Leu mutations, and one Turkish patient was compound heterozygous for Gly47Val and Trp264Ser mutations. In the endogamous Georgian Jewish population, the Gly47Arg carrier frequency was 0.102, which is consistent with the high prevalence of disease. The other mutations either were found in only one family member or patient or were extremely rare. ADA2 activity was significantly reduced in serum specimens from patients. Expression in human embryonic kidney 293T cells revealed low amounts of mutant secreted protein.Recessive loss-of-function mutations of ADA2, a growth factor that is the major extracellular adenosine deaminase, can cause polyarteritis nodosa vasculopathy with highly varied clinical expression.

24268657,Morbid obesity resulting from inactivation of the ciliary protein CEP19 in humans and mice.,"Obesity is a major public health concern, and complementary research strategies have been directed toward the identification of the underlying causative gene mutations that affect the normal pathways and networks that regulate energy balance. Here, we describe an autosomal-recessive morbid-obesity syndrome and identify the disease-causing gene defect. The average body mass index of affected family members was 48.7 (range = 36.7-61.0), and all had features of the metabolic syndrome. Homozygosity mapping localized the disease locus to a region in 3q29; we designated this region the morbid obesity 1 (MO1) locus. Sequence analysis identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in CEP19, the gene encoding the ciliary protein CEP19, in all affected family members. CEP19 is highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates, is expressed in multiple tissues, and localizes to the centrosome and primary cilia. Homozygous Cep19-knockout mice were morbidly obese, hyperphagic, glucose intolerant, and insulin resistant. Thus, loss of the ciliary protein CEP19 in humans and mice causes morbid obesity and defines a target for investigating the molecular pathogenesis of this disease and potential treatments for obesity and malnutrition.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
24611874,The molecular genetic analysis of the expanding pachyonychia congenita case collection.,"Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a rare autosomal dominant keratinizing disorder characterized by severe, painful, palmoplantar keratoderma and nail dystrophy, often accompanied by oral leucokeratosis, cysts and follicular keratosis. It is caused by mutations in one of five keratin genes: KRT6A, KRT6B, KRT6C, KRT16 or KRT17.To identify mutations in 84 new families with a clinical diagnosis of PC, recruited by the International Pachyonychia Congenita Research Registry during the last few years.Genomic DNA isolated from saliva or peripheral blood leucocytes was amplified using primers specific for the PC-associated keratin genes and polymerase chain reaction products were directly sequenced.Mutations were identified in 84 families in the PC-associated keratin genes, comprising 46 distinct keratin mutations. Fourteen were previously unreported mutations, bringing the total number of different keratin mutations associated with PC to 105.By identifying mutations in KRT6A, KRT6B, KRT6C, KRT16 or KRT17, this study has confirmed, at the molecular level, the clinical diagnosis of PC in these families.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
23275345,Autosomal recessive atrial dilated cardiomyopathy with standstill evolution associated with mutation of Natriuretic Peptide Precursor A.,"BACKGROUND: Atrial dilatation and atrial standstill are etiologically heterogeneous phenotypes with poorly defined nosology. In 1983, we described 8-years follow-up of atrial dilatation with standstill evolution in 8 patients from 3 families. We later identified 5 additional patients with identical phenotypes: 1 member of the largest original family and 4 unrelated to the 3 original families. All families are from the same geographic area in Northeast Italy. METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed up the 13 patients for up to 37 years, extended the clinical investigation and monitoring to living relatives, and investigated the genetic basis of the disease. The disease was characterized by: (1) clinical onset in adulthood; (2) biatrial dilatation up to giant size; (3) early supraventricular arrhythmias with progressive loss of atrial electric activity to atrial standstill; (4) thromboembolic complications; and (5) stable, normal left ventricular function and New York Heart Association functional class during the long-term course of the disease. By linkage analysis, we mapped a locus at 1p36.22 containing the Natriuretic Peptide Precursor A gene. By sequencing Natriuretic Peptide Precursor A, we identified a homozygous missense mutation (p.Arg150Gln) in all living affected individuals of the 6 families. All patients showed low serum levels of atrial natriuretic peptide. Heterozygous mutation carriers were healthy and demonstrated normal levels of atrial natriuretic peptide. CONCLUSIONS: Autosomal recessive atrial dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare disease associated with homozygous mutation of the Natriuretic Peptide Precursor A gene and characterized by extreme atrial dilatation with standstill evolution, thromboembolic risk, preserved left ventricular function, and severely decreased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
24531968,Evolutionarily dynamic alternative splicing of GPR56 regulates regional cerebral cortical patterning.,"The human neocortex has numerous specialized functional areas whose formation is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 15-base pair deletion mutation in a regulatory element of GPR56 that selectively disrupts human cortex surrounding the Sylvian fissure bilaterally including ""Broca's area,"" the primary language area, by disrupting regional GPR56 expression and blocking RFX transcription factor binding. GPR56 encodes a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor required for normal cortical development and is expressed in cortical progenitor cells. GPR56 expression levels regulate progenitor proliferation. GPR56 splice forms are highly variable between mice and humans, and the regulatory element of gyrencephalic mammals directs restricted lateral cortical expression. Our data reveal a mechanism by which control of GPR56 expression pattern by multiple alternative promoters can influence stem cell proliferation, gyral patterning, and, potentially, neocortex evolution.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
24389050,Genomic analysis of primordial dwarfism reveals novel disease genes.,"Primordial dwarfism (PD) is a disease in which severely impaired fetal growth persists throughout postnatal development and results in stunted adult size. The condition is highly heterogeneous clinically, but the use of certain phenotypic aspects such as head circumference and facial appearance has proven helpful in defining clinical subgroups. In this study, we present the results of clinical and genomic characterization of 16 new patients in whom a broad definition of PD was used (e.g., 3M syndrome was included). We report a novel PD syndrome with distinct facies in two unrelated patients, each with a different homozygous truncating mutation in CRIPT. Our analysis also reveals, in addition to mutations in known PD disease genes, the first instance of biallelic truncating BRCA2 mutation causing PD with normal bone marrow analysis. In addition, we have identified a novel locus for Seckel syndrome based on a consanguineous multiplex family and identified a homozygous truncating mutation in DNA2 as the likely cause. An additional novel PD disease candidate gene XRCC4 was identified by autozygome/exome analysis, and the knockout mouse phenotype is highly compatible with PD. Thus, we add a number of novel genes to the growing list of PD-linked genes, including one which we show to be linked to a novel PD syndrome with a distinct facial appearance. PD is extremely heterogeneous genetically and clinically, and genomic tools are often required to reach a molecular diagnosis.",research-article; journal article
24814193,Mutations in EMP2 cause childhood-onset nephrotic syndrome.,"Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a genetically heterogeneous group of diseases that are divided into steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) and steroid-resistant NS (SRNS). SRNS inevitably leads to end-stage kidney disease, and no curative treatment is available. To date, mutations in more than 24 genes have been described in Mendelian forms of SRNS; however, no Mendelian form of SSNS has been described. To identify a genetic form of SSNS, we performed homozygosity mapping, whole-exome sequencing, and multiplex PCR followed by next-generation sequencing. We thereby detected biallelic mutations in EMP2 (epithelial membrane protein 2) in four individuals from three unrelated families affected by SRNS or SSNS. We showed that EMP2 exclusively localized to glomeruli in the kidney. Knockdown of emp2 in zebrafish resulted in pericardial effusion, supporting the pathogenic role of mutated EMP2 in human NS. At the cellular level, we showed that knockdown of EMP2 in podocytes and endothelial cells resulted in an increased amount of CAVEOLIN-1 and decreased cell proliferation. Our data therefore identify EMP2 mutations as causing a recessive Mendelian form of SSNS.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29724491,Clinical Presentation of a Complex Neurodevelopmental Disorder Caused by Mutations in ADNP.,"BACKGROUND:In genome-wide screening studies for de novo mutations underlying autism and intellectual disability, mutations in the ADNP gene are consistently reported among the most frequent. ADNP mutations have been identified in children with autism spectrum disorder comorbid with intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and deficits in multiple organ systems. However, a comprehensive clinical description of the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome is lacking. METHODS:We identified a worldwide cohort of 78 individuals with likely disruptive mutations in ADNP from January 2014 to October 2016 through systematic literature search, by contacting collaborators, and through direct interaction with parents. Clinicians filled in a structured questionnaire on genetic and clinical findings to enable correlations between genotype and phenotype. Clinical photographs and specialist reports were gathered. Parents were interviewed to complement the written questionnaires. RESULTS:We report on the detailed clinical characterization of a large cohort of individuals with an ADNP mutation and demonstrate a distinctive combination of clinical features, including mild to severe intellectual disability, autism, severe speech and motor delay, and common facial characteristics. Brain abnormalities, behavioral problems, sleep disturbance, epilepsy, hypotonia, visual problems, congenital heart defects, gastrointestinal problems, short stature, and hormonal deficiencies are common comorbidities. Strikingly, individuals with the recurrent p.Tyr719* mutation were more severely affected. CONCLUSIONS:This overview defines the full clinical spectrum of individuals with ADNP mutations, a specific autism subtype. We show that individuals with mutations in ADNP have many overlapping clinical features that are distinctive from those of other autism and/or intellectual disability syndromes. In addition, our data show preliminary evidence of a correlation between genotype and phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
28221363,Premature primary tooth eruption in cognitive/motor-delayed ADNP-mutated children.,"A major flaw in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) management is late diagnosis. Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is a most frequent de novo mutated ASD-related gene. Functionally, ADNP protects nerve cells against electrical blockade. In mice, complete Adnp deficiency results in dysregulation of over 400 genes and failure to form a brain. Adnp haploinsufficiency results in cognitive and social deficiencies coupled to sex- and age-dependent deficits in the key microtubule and ion channel pathways. Here, collaborating with parents/caregivers globally, we discovered premature tooth eruption as a potential early diagnostic biomarker for ADNP mutation. The parents of 44/54 ADNP-mutated children reported an almost full erupted dentition by 1 year of age, including molars and only 10 of the children had teeth within the normal developmental time range. Looking at Adnp-deficient mice, by computed tomography, showed significantly smaller dental sacs and tooth buds at 5 days of age in the deficient mice compared to littermate controls. There was only trending at 2 days, implicating age-dependent dysregulation of teething in Adnp-deficient mice. Allen Atlas analysis showed Adnp expression in the jaw area. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and gene array analysis of human ADNP-mutated lymphoblastoids, whole-mouse embryos and mouse brains identified dysregulation of bone/nervous system-controlling genes resulting from ADNP mutation/deficiency (for example, BMP1 and BMP4). AKAP6, discovered here as a major gene regulated by ADNP, also links cognition and bone maintenance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that early primary (deciduous) teething is related to the ADNP syndrome, providing for early/simple diagnosis and paving the path to early intervention/specialized treatment plan.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
23860042,A homozygous 237-kb deletion at 1p31 identified as the locus for midline cleft of the upper and lower lip in a consanguineous family.,"Orofacial clefts are congenital defects that vary widely in type and severity, and can occur in isolation or in association with a variety of other defects. Herein, we describe a consanguineous family afflicted with a unique form of orofacial clefting manifesting as a facial midline defect that also involves mandibular and maxillary structures. All four affected sibs had median clefts of the upper and lower lips, tooth misalignment, and poor oral hygiene. Linkage analysis of 17 family members identified a 15.3-Mb pair recessive locus at 1p31 with a LOD score of 3.63. To the best of our knowledge, this is, to date, the first locus reported for facial midline clefting and the first recessive locus for an isolated orofacial defect. The locus harboured a novel intergenic deletion of 273 164 bp, for which all fully affected sibs were homozygous. We did not note any potentially pathogenic gene variant at the 1p31 locus via exome-sequencing analysis. The identified deletion could be harbouring a regulatory element for the gene associated with the orofacial defect. The best candidate for the putative target gene is LHX8, located 49 149 bp upstream of the deletion. The gene is known to be associated with facial development in several animals. Four other family members had a subclinical phenotype--a simple notch in the lower lip or an increase in the interdental distance between the lower incisors--indicative of very low-level expression of the trait.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
22592156,A missense mutation within the helix initiation motif of the keratin K71 gene underlies autosomal dominant woolly hair/hypotrichosis.,"Woolly hair (WH) is an abnormal variant of tightly curled hair, which is frequently associated with hypotrichosis. Non-syndromic forms of WH can show either autosomal-dominant WH (ADWH) or autosomal-recessive WH (ARWH) inheritance patterns. ARWH has recently been shown to be caused by mutations in either the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6) or lipase H (LIPH) gene. More recently, a mutation in the keratin K74 (KRT74) gene has been reported to underlie ADWH. Importantly, all of these genes are abundantly expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) of human hair follicles. Besides these findings, the molecular mechanisms underlying hereditary WH have not been fully disclosed. In this study, we identified a Japanese family with ADWH and associated hypotrichosis. After exclusion of known causative genes, we discovered the heterozygous mutation c.422T>G (p.Phe141Cys) within the helix initiation motif of the IRS-specific keratin K71 (KRT71) gene in affected family members. We demonstrated that the mutant K71 protein led to disruption of keratin intermediate filament formation in cultured cells. To our knowledge, it is previously unreported that the KRT71 mutation is associated with a hereditary hair disorder in humans. Our findings further underscore the crucial role of the IRS-specific keratins in hair follicle development and hair growth in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
24870241,CTP synthase 1 deficiency in humans reveals its central role in lymphocyte proliferation.,"Lymphocyte functions triggered by antigen recognition and co-stimulation signals are associated with a rapid and intense cell division, and hence with metabolism adaptation. The nucleotide cytidine 5' triphosphate (CTP) is a precursor required for the metabolism of DNA, RNA and phospholipids. CTP originates from two sources: a salvage pathway and a de novo synthesis pathway that depends on two enzymes, the CTP synthases (or synthetases) 1 and 2 (CTPS1 with CTPS2); the respective roles of these two enzymes are not known. CTP synthase activity is a potentially important step for DNA synthesis in lymphocytes. Here we report the identification of a loss-of-function homozygous mutation (rs145092287) in CTPS1 in humans that causes a novel and life-threatening immunodeficiency, characterized by an impaired capacity of activated T and B cells to proliferate in response to antigen receptor-mediated activation. In contrast, proximal and distal T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling events and responses were only weakly affected by the absence of CTPS1. Activated CTPS1-deficient cells had decreased levels of CTP. Normal T-cell proliferation was restored in CTPS1-deficient cells by expressing wild-type CTPS1 or by addition of exogenous CTP or its nucleoside precursor, cytidine. CTPS1 expression was found to be low in resting T cells, but rapidly upregulated following TCR activation. These results highlight a key and specific role of CTPS1 in the immune system by its capacity to sustain the proliferation of activated lymphocytes during the immune response. CTPS1 may therefore represent a therapeutic target of immunosuppressive drugs that could specifically dampen lymphocyte activation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
25105227,Mutations in LAMA1 cause cerebellar dysplasia and cysts with and without retinal dystrophy.,"Cerebellar dysplasia with cysts (CDC) is an imaging finding typically seen in combination with cobblestone cortex and congenital muscular dystrophy in individuals with dystroglycanopathies. More recently, CDC was reported in seven children without neuromuscular involvement (Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome). Using a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified biallelic mutations in LAMA1 as the cause of CDC in seven affected individuals (from five families) independent from those included in the phenotypic description of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. Most of these individuals also have high myopia, and some have retinal dystrophy and patchy increased T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2/FLAIR) signal in cortical white matter. In one additional family, we identified two siblings who have truncating LAMA1 mutations in combination with retinal dystrophy and mild cerebellar dysplasia without cysts, indicating that cysts are not an obligate feature associated with loss of LAMA1 function. This work expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with the lamininopathy disorders and highlights the tissue-specific roles played by different laminin-encoding genes.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
21396577,Acid-labile subunit (ALS) deficiency.,"The acid-labile subunit (ALS) protein is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the circulating IGF/IGFBP system. In humans, complete ALS deficiency is characterized by severely reduced serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations that is incongruent with the associated mild growth retardation (height SDS -2 to -3 SDS before and during puberty). Twenty-one patients have been described with ALS deficiency, representing 16 unique homozygous or compound heterozygous inactivating mutations of the IGFALS gene. Pubertal delay in boys and insulin insensitivity are common findings. In the assessment of a child with short stature ALS deficiency should be consider in those patients presenting: 1) a normal response to GH stimulation test, 2) low IGF-I levels associated with more profoundly reduced IGFBP-3 levels, 3) a mild growth retardation, apparently out of proportion to the degree of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 deficits, 4) lack of response to an IGF generation test and 5) insulin insensitivity.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
15280901,Congenital deficiency of alpha feto-protein.,"Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the main fetus serum glycoprotein with a very low concentration in the adult. AFP deficiency is a rare phenomenon. We studied two families with congenital AFP deficiency and searched for mutations in the AFP gene. We identified one mutation of 2 base deletion in exon 8, in both families, that leads to the congenital deficiency of AFP. The mutation nt930-931delCT (T294fs25X) creates a frameshift after codon 294 that leads to a stop codon after 24 amino acids, thus truncating the normal length of AFP of 609 amino acids. All the affected children were found to be homozygous for the mutation as was one of the fathers. The affected individuals were asymptomatic and presented normal development. This first identification of a mutation in the AFP gene demonstrates for the first time that deficiency of AFP is compatible with human normal fetal development and further reproduction in males.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
14699509,Hereditary persistence of alpha-fetoprotein is due to both proximal and distal hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 site mutations.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS:The molecular mechanism of hereditary persistence of alpha-fetoprotein (HPAFP) has been previously described in a large Scottish family, consisting of a -119G>A substitution in the distal hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) binding site of the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene promoter. We report here the molecular mechanisms of HPAFP in 2 new unrelated families. METHODS:Family 1 was of Bengali origin, and family 2 was Italian. Four of 5 subjects (family 1) and 3 of 9 (family 2) showed HPAFP. The AFP gene promoter was studied in all available family members. RESULTS:All subjects with high AFP levels had mutated promoter sequences. Family 1 showed the reported -119G>A substitution. Family 2 showed -55C>A and -65C>T substitutions in the proximal putative HNF-1 binding region of the promoter. The -55C>A mutation increased the similarity of the proximal HNF-1 binding region to a consensus binding region. Gel shift assays confirmed its increased affinity toward HNF-1, and transfection experiments revealed an increased level of gene transcription. The -65C>T substitution theoretically created a CCAAT box. However, gel shift and transfection experiments failed to show any biological effect of this substitution that is associated with the -55C>A mutation. CONCLUSIONS:Two different mutations localized in either HNF-1 binding sites of the AFP gene promoter may result in HPAFP. This highlights the importance of HNF-1 in AFP gene expression. Unexplained persistent AFP should lead to family study and/or AFP gene promoter sequencing to avoid inappropriate explorations and treatment decisions.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
24741995,"EPS8, encoding an actin-binding protein of cochlear hair cell stereocilia, is a new causal gene for autosomal recessive profound deafness.","BACKGROUND: Almost 90% of all cases of congenital, non-syndromic, severe to profound inherited deafness display an autosomal recessive mode of transmission (DFNB forms). To date, 47 causal DFNB genes have been identified, but many others remain to be discovered. We report the study of two siblings born to consanguineous Algerian parents and affected by isolated, profound congenital deafness. METHOD: Whole-exome sequencing was carried out on these patients after a failure to identify mutations in the DFNB genes frequently involved. RESULTS: A biallelic nonsense mutation, c.88C > T (p.Gln30*), was identified in EPS8 that encodes epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8, a 822 amino-acid protein involved in actin dynamics. This mutation predicts a truncated inactive protein or no protein at all. The mutation was also present, in the heterozygous state, in one clinically unaffected sibling and in both unaffected parents, and was absent from the other two unaffected siblings. It was not found in 120 Algerian normal hearing control individuals or in the Exome Variant Server database. EPS8 is an F-actin capping and bundling protein. Mutant mice lacking EPS8 (Eps8-/- mice), which is present in the hair bundle, the sensory antenna of the auditory sensory cells that operate the mechano-electrical transduction, are also profoundly deaf and have abnormally short hair bundle stereocilia. CONCLUSION: This new DFNB form is likely to arise from abnormal hair bundles resulting in compromised detection of physiological sound pressures.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
11285252,Positional cloning of a novel gene on chromosome 16q causing Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS2).,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder with the primary clinical features of obesity, pigmented retinopathy, polydactyly, hypogenitalism, mental retardation and renal anomalies. Associated features of the disorder include diabetes mellitus, hypertension and congenital heart disease. There are six known BBS loci, mapping to chromosomes 2, 3, 11, 15, 16 and 20. The BBS2 locus was initially mapped to an 18 cM interval on chromosome 16q21 with a large inbred Bedouin kindred. Further analysis of the Bedouin population allowed for the fine mapping of this locus to a 2 cM region distal to marker D16S408. Physical mapping and sequence analysis of this region resulted in the identification of a number of known genes and expressed sequence tag clusters. Mutation screening of a novel gene (BBS2) with a wide pattern of tissue expression revealed homozygous mutations in two inbred pedigrees, including the large Bedouin kindred used to initially identify the BBS2 locus. In addition, mutations were found in three of 18 unrelated BBS probands from small nuclear families.",research-article; journal article
23829372,Carrier frequency of two BBS2 mutations in the Ashkenazi population.,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is known to be caused by numerous mutations that occur in at least 15 of the BBS genes. As the disease follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, carrier screening can be performed for at-risk couples, but the number of potential mutation sites to screen can be daunting. Ethnic studies can help to narrow this range by highlighting mutations that are present at higher percentages in certain populations. In this article, the carrier frequency for two mutations that occur in the BBS2 gene, c.311A>C and c.1895G>C were studied in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent in order to advise on including them in existing mutation panels for this population. Carrier screenings were performed on individuals from the Ashkenazi Jewish population using a combination of TaqMan genotyping assays followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and allelic discrimination, and allele-specific PCR confirmed by restriction analysis. The combined results indicated carrier frequencies of 0.473% (±0.0071%) for the c.311A>C mutation and 0.261% (±0.0064%) for the c.1895G>C mutation. On the basis of these frequencies, we believe that the two mutations should be considered for inclusion in screening panels for the Ashkenazi population.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
16823392,"Pitfalls of homozygosity mapping: an extended consanguineous Bardet-Biedl syndrome family with two mutant genes (BBS2, BBS10), three mutations, but no triallelism.","The extensive genetic heterogeneity of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is documented by the identification, by classical linkage analysis complemented recently by comparative genomic approaches, of nine genes (BBS1-9) that account cumulatively for about 50% of patients. The BBS genes appear implicated in cilia and basal body assembly or function. In order to find new BBS genes, we performed SNP homozygosity mapping analysis in an extended consanguineous family living in a small Lebanese village. This uncovered an unexpectedly complex pattern of mutations, and led us to identify a novel BBS gene (BBS10). In one sibship of the pedigree, a BBS2 homozygous mutation was identified, while in three other sibships, a homozygous missense mutation was identified in a gene encoding a vertebrate-specific chaperonine-like protein (BBS10). The single patient in the last sibship was a compound heterozygote for the above BBS10 mutation and another one in the same gene. Although triallelism (three deleterious alleles in the same patient) has been described in some BBS families, we have to date no evidence that this is the case in the present family. The analysis of this family challenged linkage analysis based on the expectation of a single locus and mutation. The very high informativeness of SNP arrays was instrumental in elucidating this case, which illustrates possible pitfalls of homozygosity mapping in extended families, and that can be explained by the rather high prevalence of heterozygous carriers of BBS mutations (estimated at one in 50 in Europeans).","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

A high incidence of congenital and acquired heart disease was reported in the former ""Laurence-Moon-Biedl-Bardet"" syndrome. However, since the establishment of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome as a separate clinical entity, cardiac involvement has not been evaluated in this disorder. We have performed echocardiographic studies on 22 patients with the Bardet-Biedl syndrome from three extended, highly inbred Bedouin families. In addition to previously reported congenital heart defects we have observed hypertrophy of the interventricular septum and dilated cardiomyopathy. Our findings of cardiac involvement in 50% of the cases suggest that echocardiographic examination should be included in the clinical evaluation and follow-up of patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome.",review; journal article
11381270,"Identification of the gene that, when mutated, causes the human obesity syndrome BBS4.","Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS, MIM 209900) is a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by obesity, pigmentary retinopathy, polydactyly, renal malformations, mental retardation, and hypogenitalism. The disorder is also associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and congenital heart disease. Six distinct BBS loci map to 11q13 (BBS1), 16q21 (BBS2), 3p13-p12 (BBS3), 15q22.3-q23 (BBS4), 2q31 (BBS5), and 20p12 (BBS6). Although BBS is rare in the general population (<1/100,000), there is considerable interest in identifying the genes causing BBS because components of the phenotype, such as obesity and diabetes, are common. We and others have demonstrated that BBS6 is caused by mutations in the gene MKKS (refs. 12,13), mutation of which also causes McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (hydrometrocolpos, post-axial polydactyly, and congenital heart defects). MKKS has sequence homology to the alpha subunit of a prokaryotic chaperonin in the thermosome Thermoplasma acidophilum. We recently identified a novel gene that causes BBS2. The BBS2 protein has no significant similarity to other chaperonins or known proteins.

15654695,Clinical evidence of decreased olfaction in Bardet-Biedl syndrome caused by a deletion in the BBS4 gene.,"Recent discoveries have lead to the hypothesis that ciliary dysfunction is a mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Here, we describe two individuals with decreased olfaction who are members of an extended family affected with BBS caused by a homozygous deletion (c.77-220del) in the BBS4 gene. These findings correlate with the evidence that several BBS proteins, including BBS4, are expressed in the olfactory epithelium (OE). Although the prevalence and the spectrum of impaired olfaction in BBS are not known, the causal relationship of the BBS4 deletion in this family and the decreased olfaction is corroborated by evidence that Bbs2 and Bbs4 knockout mice have severe olfaction deficits and that also patients with BBS caused by mutations in other BBS genes can have impaired olfaction. This finding broadens the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with BBS, confirms the role of BBS4 in olfaction, and lends support to the hypothesis that ciliary dysfunction is an important aspect of BBS pathogenesis.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; journal article; case reports"
11781148,A novel splicing mutation causes an undescribed type of analbuminemia.,"Analbuminemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder manifested by the absence or severe reduction of circulating serum albumin in homozygous subjects. In this report we describe a new molecular defect that caused the analbuminemic trait in a newborn of Iraqi origin. When the parents' DNA was analyzed, both subjects were found to be heterozygous for the same mutation found in the infant. All the 14 exon and flanking intron sequences of the albumin gene were amplified via PCR and screened for mutations by SSCP and heteroduplex analysis. A mutation in the DNA region encoding exon 1 and its flanking intron was revealed by the presence of a heteroduplex. The fragment, which was directly DNA sequenced, contains a previously unreported single nucleotide change, consisting in a G to A substitution at nucleotide 118 in the structural gene of the human protein. This mutation, involving the first base of intron 1, destroys the GT dinucleotide consensus sequence found at the 5' end of most intervening sequences and causes the defective pre-mRNA splicing responsible for the analbuminemic trait.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
24913602,Hennekam syndrome can be caused by FAT4 mutations and be allelic to Van Maldergem syndrome.,"The Hennekam lymphangiectasia-lymphedema syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder.

We used homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in the original HS family with multiple affected individuals in whom no CCBE1 mutation had been detected, and identified a homozygous mutation in the FAT4 gene. Subsequent targeted mutation analysis of FAT4 in a cohort of 24 CCBE1 mutation-negative Hennekam syndrome patients identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in four additional families. Mutations in FAT4 have been previously associated with Van Maldergem syndrome. Detailed clinical comparison between van Maldergem syndrome and Hennekam syndrome patients shows that there is a substantial overlap in phenotype, especially in facial appearance. We conclude that Hennekam syndrome can be caused by mutations in FAT4 and be allelic to Van Maldergem syndrome.",comparative study; journal article
25329329,Autosomal dominant immune dysregulation syndrome in humans with CTLA4 mutations.,"The protein cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is an essential negative regulator of immune responses, and its loss causes fatal autoimmunity in mice. We studied a large family in which five individuals presented with a complex, autosomal dominant immune dysregulation syndrome characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections and multiple autoimmune clinical features. We identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation in exon 1 of CTLA4. Screening of 71 unrelated patients with comparable clinical phenotypes identified five additional families (nine individuals) with previously undescribed splice site and missense mutations in CTLA4. Clinical penetrance was incomplete (eight adults of a total of 19 genetically proven CTLA4 mutation carriers were considered unaffected). However, CTLA-4 protein expression was decreased in regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in both patients and carriers with CTLA4 mutations. Whereas Treg cells were generally present at elevated numbers in these individuals, their suppressive function, CTLA-4 ligand binding and transendocytosis of CD80 were impaired. Mutations in CTLA4 were also associated with decreased circulating B cell numbers. Taken together, mutations in CTLA4 resulting in CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency or impaired ligand binding result in disrupted T and B cell homeostasis and a complex immune dysregulation syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

The consequences of mutations in CTLA4 in humans are unknown. We identified germline heterozygous mutations in CTLA4 in subjects with severe immune dysregulation from four unrelated families. Whereas Ctla4 heterozygous mice have no obvious phenotype, human CTLA4 haploinsufficiency caused dysregulation of FoxP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells, hyperactivation of effector T cells, and lymphocytic infiltration of target organs. Patients also exhibited progressive loss of circulating B cells, associated with an increase of predominantly autoreactive CD21(lo) B cells and accumulation of B cells in nonlymphoid organs. Inherited human CTLA4 haploinsufficiency demonstrates a critical quantitative role for CTLA-4 in governing T and B lymphocyte homeostasis.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29729943,"Phenotype, penetrance, and treatment of 133 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-insufficient subjects.","BACKGROUND:Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a negative immune regulator. Heterozygous CTLA4 germline mutations can cause a complex immune dysregulation syndrome in human subjects. OBJECTIVE:We sought to characterize the penetrance, clinical features, and best treatment options in 133 CTLA4 mutation carriers. METHODS:Genetics, clinical features, laboratory values, and outcomes of treatment options were assessed in a worldwide cohort of CTLA4 mutation carriers. RESULTS:We identified 133 subjects from 54 unrelated families carrying 45 different heterozygous CTLA4 mutations, including 28 previously undescribed mutations. Ninety mutation carriers were considered affected, suggesting a clinical penetrance of at least 67%; median age of onset was 11 years, and the mortality rate within affected mutation carriers was 16% (n = 15). Main clinical manifestations included hypogammaglobulinemia (84%), lymphoproliferation (73%), autoimmune cytopenia (62%), and respiratory (68%), gastrointestinal (59%), or neurological features (29%). Eight affected mutation carriers had lymphoma, and 3 had gastric cancer. An EBV association was found in 6 patients with malignancies. CTLA4 mutations were associated with lymphopenia and decreased T-, B-, and natural killer (NK) cell counts. Successful targeted therapies included application of CTLA-4 fusion proteins, mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. EBV reactivation occurred in 2 affected mutation carriers after immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS:Affected mutation carriers with CTLA-4 insufficiency can present in any medical specialty. Family members should be counseled because disease manifestation can occur as late as 50 years of age. EBV- and cytomegalovirus-associated complications must be closely monitored. Treatment interventions should be coordinated in clinical trials.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) provides a powerful new tool for familial disease gene discovery. Here, synergistic application of these genomic strategies identified the pathogenic mutation in a familial syndrome of atrial tachyarrhythmia, conduction system disease (CSD), and DCM vulnerability. Seven members of a three-generation family exhibited the variably expressed phenotype, three of whom manifested CSD and clinically significant arrhythmia in childhood. Genome-wide linkage analysis mapped two equally plausible loci to chromosomes 1p3 and 13q12. Variants from WES of two affected cousins were filtered for rare, predicted-deleterious, positional variants, revealing an unreported heterozygous missense mutation disrupting the highly conserved kinase domain in TNNI3K. The G526D substitution in troponin I interacting kinase, with the most deleterious SIFT and Polyphen2 scores possible, resulted in abnormal peptide aggregation in vitro and in silico docking models predicted altered yet energetically favorable wild-type mutant dimerization. Ventricular tissue from a mutation carrier displayed histopathological hallmarks of DCM and reduced TNNI3K protein staining with unique amorphous nuclear and sarcoplasmic inclusions. In conclusion, mutation of TNNI3K, encoding a heart-specific kinase previously shown to modulate cardiac conduction and myocardial function in mice, underlies a familial syndrome of electrical and myopathic heart disease. The identified substitution causes a TNNI3K aggregation defect and protein deficiency, implicating a dominant-negative loss of function disease mechanism.",letter
24899048,Rare and common variants in extracellular matrix gene Fibrillin 2 (FBN2) are associated with macular degeneration.,"Neurodegenerative diseases affecting the macula constitute a major cause of incurable vision loss and exhibit considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity, from early-onset monogenic disease to multifactorial late-onset age-related macular degeneration (AMD). As part of our continued efforts to define genetic causes of macular degeneration, we performed whole exome sequencing in four individuals of a two-generation family with autosomal dominant maculopathy and identified a rare variant p.Glu1144Lys in Fibrillin 2 (FBN2), a glycoprotein of the elastin-rich extracellular matrix (ECM). Sanger sequencing validated the segregation of this variant in the complete pedigree, including two additional affected and one unaffected individual. Sequencing of 192 maculopathy patients revealed additional rare variants, predicted to disrupt FBN2 function. We then undertook additional studies to explore the relationship of FBN2 to macular disease. We show that FBN2 localizes to Bruch's membrane and its expression appears to be reduced in aging and AMD eyes, prompting us to examine its relationship with AMD. We detect suggestive association of a common FBN2 non-synonymous variant, rs154001 (p.Val965Ile) with AMD in 10 337 cases and 11 174 controls (OR = 1.10; P-value = 3.79 × 10(-5)). Thus, it appears that rare and common variants in a single gene--FBN2--can contribute to Mendelian and complex forms of macular degeneration. Our studies provide genetic evidence for a key role of elastin microfibers and Bruch's membrane in maintaining blood-retina homeostasis and establish the importance of studying orphan diseases for understanding more common clinical phenotypes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
22859821,Mycobacterial disease and impaired IFN-γ immunity in humans with inherited ISG15 deficiency.,"ISG15 is an interferon (IFN)-α/β-inducible, ubiquitin-like intracellular protein. Its conjugation to various proteins (ISGylation) contributes to antiviral immunity in mice. Here, we describe human patients with inherited ISG15 deficiency and mycobacterial, but not viral, diseases. The lack of intracellular ISG15 production and protein ISGylation was not associated with cellular susceptibility to any viruses that we tested, consistent with the lack of viral diseases in these patients. By contrast, the lack of mycobacterium-induced ISG15 secretion by leukocytes-granulocyte, in particular-reduced the production of IFN-γ by lymphocytes, including natural killer cells, probably accounting for the enhanced susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. This experiment of nature shows that human ISGylation is largely redundant for antiviral immunity, but that ISG15 plays an essential role as an IFN-γ-inducing secreted molecule for optimal antimycobacterial immunity.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
25307056,Human intracellular ISG15 prevents interferon-α/β over-amplification and auto-inflammation.,"Intracellular ISG15 is an interferon (IFN)-α/β-inducible ubiquitin-like modifier which can covalently bind other proteins in a process called ISGylation; it is an effector of IFN-α/β-dependent antiviral immunity in mice. We previously published a study describing humans with inherited ISG15 deficiency but without unusually severe viral diseases. We showed that these patients were prone to mycobacterial disease and that human ISG15 was non-redundant as an extracellular IFN-γ-inducing molecule. We show here that ISG15-deficient patients also display unanticipated cellular, immunological and clinical signs of enhanced IFN-α/β immunity, reminiscent of the Mendelian autoinflammatory interferonopathies Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and spondyloenchondrodysplasia. We further show that an absence of intracellular ISG15 in the patients' cells prevents the accumulation of USP18, a potent negative regulator of IFN-α/β signalling, resulting in the enhancement and amplification of IFN-α/β responses. Human ISG15, therefore, is not only redundant for antiviral immunity, but is a key negative regulator of IFN-α/β immunity. In humans, intracellular ISG15 is IFN-α/β-inducible not to serve as a substrate for ISGylation-dependent antiviral immunity, but to ensure USP18-dependent regulation of IFN-α/β and prevention of IFN-α/β-dependent autoinflammation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

Family 1 is of Japanese ancestry, and family 2 is of European ancestry.In family 1, affected individuals were compound heterozygous for chromosome 10 open reading frame 2 (C10orf2) p.Arg391His and p.Asn585Ser. In family 2, affected individuals were compound heterozygous for C10orf2 p.Trp441Gly and p.Val507Ile. C10orf2 encodes Twinkle, a primase-helicase essential for replication of mitochondrial DNA. Conservation and structural modeling support the causality of the mutations. Twinkle is known also to harbor multiple mutations, nearly all missenses, leading to dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia type 3 and to recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 7, also known as infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia.Our study identifies Twinkle mutations as a cause of Perrault syndrome accompanied by neurologic features and expands the phenotypic spectrum of recessive disease caused by mutations in Twinkle.

The male proband of Family 2 was homozygous for an ITGB6 transition mutation in Exon 11 (g.73664C > T c.1846C > T p.Arg616*) and hemizygous for a transition mutation in Exon 6 of Nance-Horan Syndrome (NHS Xp22.13; g.355444T > C c.1697T > C p.Met566Thr). These are the first disease-causing ITGB6 mutations to be reported. Immunohistochemistry of mouse mandibular incisors localized ITGB6 to the distal membrane of differentiating ameloblasts and pre-ameloblasts, and then ITGB6 appeared to be internalized by secretory stage ameloblasts. ITGB6 expression was strongest in the maturation stage and its localization was associated with ameloblast modulation. Our findings demonstrate that early and late amelogenesis depend upon cell-matrix interactions. Our approach (from knockout mouse phenotype to human disease) demonstrates the power of mouse reverse genetics in mutational analysis of human genetic disorders and attests to the need for a careful dental phenotyping in large-scale knockout mouse projects.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
24319098,A missense mutation in ITGB6 causes pitted hypomineralized amelogenesis imperfecta.,"We identified a family in which pitted hypomineralized amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) with premature enamel failure segregated in an autosomal recessive fashion. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a missense mutation (c.586C>A, p.P196T) in the I-domain of integrin-β6 (ITGB6), which is consistently predicted to be pathogenic by all available programmes and is the only variant that segregates with the disease phenotype. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that mice lacking a functional allele of Itgb6 display a hypomaturation AI phenotype. Phenotypic characterization of affected human teeth in this study showed areas of abnormal prismatic organization, areas of low mineral density and severe abnormal surface pitting in the tooth's coronal portion. We suggest that the pathogenesis of this form of AI may be due to ineffective ligand binding of ITGB6 resulting in either compromised cell-matrix interaction or compromised ITGB6 activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) impacting indirectly on ameloblast-ameloblast interactions and proteolytic processing of extracellular matrix proteins via MMP20. This study adds to the list of genes mutated in AI and further highlights the importance of cell-matrix interactions during enamel formation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
23404334,Congenital myasthenic syndromes due to mutations in ALG2 and ALG14.,"Congenital myasthenic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders that arise from impaired signal transmission at the neuromuscular synapse. They are characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. We performed linkage analysis, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing to determine the underlying defect in patients with an inherited limb-girdle pattern of myasthenic weakness. We identify ALG14 and ALG2 as novel genes in which mutations cause a congenital myasthenic syndrome. Through analogy with yeast, ALG14 is thought to form a multiglycosyltransferase complex with ALG13 and DPAGT1 that catalyses the first two committed steps of asparagine-linked protein glycosylation. We show that ALG14 is concentrated at the muscle motor endplates and small interfering RNA silencing of ALG14 results in reduced cell-surface expression of muscle acetylcholine receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. ALG2 is an alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase that also catalyses early steps in the asparagine-linked glycosylation pathway. Mutations were identified in two kinships, with mutation ALG2p.Val68Gly found to severely reduce ALG2 expression both in patient muscle, and in cell cultures. Identification of DPAGT1, ALG14 and ALG2 mutations as a cause of congenital myasthenic syndrome underscores the importance of asparagine-linked protein glycosylation for proper functioning of the neuromuscular junction. These syndromes form part of the wider spectrum of congenital disorders of glycosylation caused by impaired asparagine-linked glycosylation. It is likely that further genes encoding components of this pathway will be associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes or impaired neuromuscular transmission as part of a more severe multisystem disorder. Our findings suggest that treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors may improve muscle function in many of the congenital disorders of glycosylation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article"
32041641,Five new cases of syndromic intellectual disability due to KAT6A mutations: widening the molecular and clinical spectrum.,"BACKGROUND:Pathogenic variants of the lysine acetyltransferase 6A or KAT6A gene are associated with a newly identified neurodevelopmental disorder characterized mainly by intellectual disability of variable severity and speech delay, hypotonia, and heart and eye malformations. Although loss of function (LoF) mutations were initially reported as causing this disorder, missense mutations, to date always involving serine residues, have recently been associated with a form of the disorder without cardiac involvement. RESULTS:In this study we present five new patients, four with truncating mutations and one with a missense change and the only one not presenting with cardiac anomalies. The missense change [p.(Gly359Ser)], also predicted to affect splicing by in silico tools, was functionally tested in the patient's lymphocyte RNA revealing a splicing effect for this allele that would lead to a frameshift and premature truncation. CONCLUSIONS:An extensive revision of the clinical features of these five patients revealed high concordance with the 80 cases previously reported, including developmental delay with speech delay, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, a high bulbous nose, and recurrent infections. Other features present in some of these five patients, such as cryptorchidism in males, syndactyly, and trigonocephaly, expand the clinical spectrum of this syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
23832105,Loss-of-function variation in the DPP6 gene is associated with autosomal dominant microcephaly and mental retardation.,"The molecular basis of autosomal dominant microcephaly, a disorder associated with small head circumferences that results in variable mental retardation, is largely unknown. In the present study, we conducted a variation analysis of the DPP6 gene in patients with autosomal dominant microcephaly and variable mental retardation. The copy number variation analysis of DPP6 was performed on DNA samples from 22 patients with microcephaly using high-resolution, array-based genomic hybridization, and sequence analysis was performed to screen mutations in another 50 microcephalic patients. Two de novo deletions and one missense mutation in familial microcephalic patients were identified. The transfection of plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein-pLLU2G-shDPP6 fusion proteins in mouse brains revealed that the decreased expression of the DPP6 gene slightly reduced the weight of the mouse brains and resulted in mouse learning disabilities compared with their wild-type littermates. Our data indicate that the loss-of-function variations in DPP6 are associated with autosomal dominant microcephaly and mental retardation. DPP6 appears to play a major role in the regulation of proliferation and migration of neurons in neurogenesis, most likely by participating in neuronal electrical excitability, synaptic integration, and plasticity.",journal article
26924530,DVL3 Alleles Resulting in a -1 Frameshift of the Last Exon Mediate Autosomal-Dominant Robinow Syndrome.,"Robinow syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by mesomelic limb shortening, genital hypoplasia, and distinctive facial features. Recent reports have identified, in individuals with dominant Robinow syndrome, a specific type of variant characterized by being uniformly located in the penultimate exon of DVL1 and resulting in a -1 frameshift allele with a premature termination codon that escapes nonsense-mediated decay. Here, we studied a cohort of individuals who had been clinically diagnosed with Robinow syndrome but who had not received a molecular diagnosis from variant studies of DVL1, WNT5A, and ROR2. Because of the uniform location of frameshift variants in DVL1-mediated Robinow syndrome and the functional redundancy of DVL1, DVL2, and DVL3, we elected to pursue direct Sanger sequencing of the penultimate exon of DVL1 and its paralogs DVL2 and DVL3 to search for potential disease-associated variants. Remarkably, targeted sequencing identified five unrelated individuals harboring heterozygous, de novo frameshift variants in DVL3, including two splice acceptor mutations and three 1 bp deletions. Similar to the variants observed in DVL1-mediated Robinow syndrome, all variants in DVL3 result in a -1 frameshift, indicating that these highly specific alterations might be a common cause of dominant Robinow syndrome. Here, we review the current knowledge of these peculiar variant alleles in DVL1- and DVL3-mediated Robinow syndrome and further elucidate the phenotypic features present in subjects with DVL1 and DVL3 frameshift mutations.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25817018,Mutations in TUBGCP4 alter microtubule organization via the γ-tubulin ring complex in autosomal-recessive microcephaly with chorioretinopathy.,"We have identified TUBGCP4 variants in individuals with autosomal-recessive microcephaly and chorioretinopathy. Whole-exome sequencing performed on one family with two affected siblings and independently on another family with one affected child revealed compound-heterozygous mutations in TUBGCP4. Subsequent Sanger sequencing was performed on a panel of individuals from 12 French families affected by microcephaly and ophthalmic manifestations, and one other individual was identified with compound-heterozygous mutations in TUBGCP4. One synonymous variant was common to all three families and was shown to induce exon skipping; the other mutations were frameshift mutations and a deletion. TUBGCP4 encodes γ-tubulin complex protein 4, a component belonging to the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) and known to regulate the nucleation and organization of microtubules. Functional analysis of individual fibroblasts disclosed reduced levels of the γ-TuRC, altered nucleation and organization of microtubules, abnormal nuclear shape, and aneuploidy. Moreover, zebrafish treated with morpholinos against tubgcp4 were found to have reduced head volume and eye developmental anomalies with chorioretinal dysplasia. In summary, the identification of TUBGCP4 mutations in individuals with microcephaly and a spectrum of anomalies in eye development, particularly photoreceptor anomalies, provides evidence of an important role for the γ-TuRC in brain and eye development.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
25839329,De novo mutations in SIK1 cause a spectrum of developmental epilepsies.,"Developmental epilepsies are age-dependent seizure disorders for which genetic causes have been increasingly identified. Here we report six unrelated individuals with mutations in salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) in a series of 101 persons with early myoclonic encephalopathy, Ohtahara syndrome, and infantile spasms. Individuals with SIK1 mutations had short survival in cases with neonatal epilepsy onset, and an autism plus developmental syndrome after infantile spasms in others. All six mutations occurred outside the kinase domain of SIK1 and each of the mutants displayed autophosphorylation and kinase activity toward HDAC5. Three mutations generated truncated forms of SIK1 that were resistant to degradation and also showed changes in sub-cellular localization compared to wild-type SIK1. We also report the human neuropathologic examination of SIK1-related developmental epilepsy, with normal neuronal morphology and lamination but abnormal SIK1 protein cellular localization. Therefore, these results expand the genetic etiologies of developmental epilepsies by demonstrating SIK1 mutations as a cause of severe developmental epilepsy.","brief-report; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
12471561,"Identification of CRYM as a candidate responsible for nonsyndromic deafness, through cDNA microarray analysis of human cochlear and vestibular tissues.","Through cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression in human cochlea and vestibule, we detected strong expression of mu-crystallin (CRYM; also known as ""NADP-regulated thyroid hormone-binding protein"") only in these inner-ear tissues. In a subsequent search for mutations of CRYM, among 192 patients with nonsyndromic deafness, we identified two mutations at the C-terminus; one was a de novo change (X315Y) in a patient with unaffected parents, and the other was a missense mutation (K314T) that segregated dominantly in the proband's family. When the mutated proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells, their subcellular localizations were different from that of the normal protein: the X315Y mutant showed vacuolated distribution in the cytoplasm, and the K314T mutant localized in perinuclear areas, whereas normal protein was distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm. Aberrant intracellular localization of the mutated proteins might cause dysfunction of the CRYM product and result in hearing impairment. In situ hybridization analysis using mouse tissues indicated its expression in the lateral region of the spiral ligament and the fibrocytes of the spiral limbus, implying its possible involvement in the potassium-ion recycling system. Our results strongly implicate CRYM in normal auditory function and identify it as one of the genes that can be responsible for nonsyndromic deafness.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
25533962,Large-scale discovery of novel genetic causes of developmental disorders.,"Despite three decades of successful, predominantly phenotype-driven discovery of the genetic causes of monogenic disorders, up to half of children with severe developmental disorders of probable genetic origin remain without a genetic diagnosis. Particularly challenging are those disorders rare enough to have eluded recognition as a discrete clinical entity, those with highly variable clinical manifestations, and those that are difficult to distinguish from other, very similar, disorders. Here we demonstrate the power of using an unbiased genotype-driven approach to identify subsets of patients with similar disorders. By studying 1,133 children with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders, and their parents, using a combination of exome sequencing and array-based detection of chromosomal rearrangements, we discovered 12 novel genes associated with developmental disorders. These newly implicated genes increase by 10% (from 28% to 31%) the proportion of children that could be diagnosed. Clustering of missense mutations in six of these newly implicated genes suggests that normal development is being perturbed by an activating or dominant-negative mechanism. Our findings demonstrate the value of adopting a comprehensive strategy, both genome-wide and nationwide, to elucidate the underlying causes of rare genetic disorders.",research-article; journal article
15220921,"A new, tenth subunit of TFIIH is responsible for the DNA repair syndrome trichothiodystrophy group A.","DNA repair-deficient trichothiodystrophy (TTD) results from mutations in the XPD and XPB subunits of the DNA repair and transcription factor TFIIH. In a third form of DNA repair-deficient TTD, called group A, none of the nine subunits encoding TFIIH carried mutations; instead, the steady-state level of the entire complex was severely reduced. A new, tenth TFIIH subunit (TFB5) was recently identified in yeast. Here, we describe the identification of the human TFB5 ortholog and its association with human TFIIH. Microinjection of cDNA encoding TFB5 (GTF2H5, also called TTDA) corrected the DNA-repair defect of TTD-A cells, and we identified three functional inactivating mutations in this gene in three unrelated families with TTD-A. The GTF2H5 gene product has a role in regulating the level of TFIIH. The identification of a new evolutionarily conserved subunit of TFIIH implicated in TTD-A provides insight into TFIIH function in transcription, DNA repair and human disease.","research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s.; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Documented instances of familial transmission are rare. All three siblings in one family pedigree showed bilateral Brown syndrome. Other family members were reportedly unaffected.

25894502,COPA mutations impair ER-Golgi transport and cause hereditary autoimmune-mediated lung disease and arthritis.,"Unbiased genetic studies have uncovered surprising molecular mechanisms in human cellular immunity and autoimmunity. We performed whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing in five families with an apparent mendelian syndrome of autoimmunity characterized by high-titer autoantibodies, inflammatory arthritis and interstitial lung disease. We identified four unique deleterious variants in the COPA gene (encoding coatomer subunit α) affecting the same functional domain. Hypothesizing that mutant COPA leads to defective intracellular transport via coat protein complex I (COPI), we show that COPA variants impair binding to proteins targeted for retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport. Additionally, expression of mutant COPA results in ER stress and the upregulation of cytokines priming for a T helper type 17 (TH17) response. Patient-derived CD4(+) T cells also demonstrate significant skewing toward a TH17 phenotype that is implicated in autoimmunity. Our findings uncover an unexpected molecular link between a vesicular transport protein and a syndrome of autoimmunity manifested by lung and joint disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

25352053,Germline CARD11 Mutation in a Patient with Severe Congenital B Cell Lymphocytosis.,"Activating germline mutations in CARD11 have recently been linked to a rare genetic disorder associated with congenital B cell lymphocytosis. We describe a patient with a similar clinical phenotype who had a de novo germline G123D CARD11 mutation.Whole exome sequencing was performed on DNA from the patient and his biological parents. Laboratory studies examined characteristics of the patient's B and T lymphocytes. A CARD11 cDNA containing the mutation was transfected into a lymphocyte cell line to gain an understanding of its function. RNA sequencing was performed on samples from the patient and from patients with alternate germline CARD11 mutations and differential gene expression analysis was performed.The patient had a decade-long history of severe polyclonal B lymphocytosis in the 20,000-90,000 lymphocytes/mm(3) range, which was markedly exacerbated by EBV infection and splenectomy at different times. He had a heterozygous germline CARD11 mutation causing a G123D amino acid substitution, which was demonstrated to induce NF-κB activation in unstimulated lymphocytes. In contrast to previous patients with CARD11 mutations, this patient's B cells exhibited higher expression of several cell cycle progression genes, as well as enhanced proliferation and improved survival following B cell receptor stimulation.This is the third reported germline and first de novo CARD11 mutation shown to cause congenital B cell lymphocytosis. The mutation was associated with a dramatically greater lymphocytosis than in previously described cases, disproportionate to the level of constitutive NF-κB activation. However, comparative review of the patient's clinical history, combined with additional genomic and functional analyses, underscore other important variables that may affect pathophysiology or regulate mutant CARD11 function in B cell proliferation and disease. We now refer to these patients as having BENTA disease (B cell Expansion with NF-κB and T cell Anergy).","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
23129749,Congenital B cell lymphocytosis explained by novel germline CARD11 mutations.,"Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) controls genes involved in normal lymphocyte functions, but constitutive NF-κB activation is often associated with B cell malignancy. Using high-throughput whole transcriptome sequencing, we investigated a unique family with hereditary polyclonal B cell lymphocytosis. We found a novel germline heterozygous missense mutation (E127G) in affected patients in the gene encoding CARD11, a scaffolding protein required for antigen receptor (AgR)-induced NF-κB activation in both B and T lymphocytes. We subsequently identified a second germline mutation (G116S) in an unrelated, phenotypically similar patient, confirming mutations in CARD11 drive disease. Like somatic, gain-of-function CARD11 mutations described in B cell lymphoma, these germline CARD11 mutants spontaneously aggregate and drive constitutive NF-κB activation. However, these CARD11 mutants rendered patient T cells less responsive to AgR-induced activation. By reexamining this rare genetic disorder first reported four decades ago, our findings provide new insight into why activating CARD11 mutations may induce B cell expansion and preferentially predispose to B cell malignancy without dramatically perturbing T cell homeostasis.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; case reports"
26073778,Biallelic Mutations in NBAS Cause Recurrent Acute Liver Failure with Onset in Infancy.,"Acute liver failure (ALF) in infancy and childhood is a life-threatening emergency. Few conditions are known to cause recurrent acute liver failure (RALF), and in about 50% of cases, the underlying molecular cause remains unresolved. Exome sequencing in five unrelated individuals with fever-dependent RALF revealed biallelic mutations in NBAS. Subsequent Sanger sequencing of NBAS in 15 additional unrelated individuals with RALF or ALF identified compound heterozygous mutations in an additional six individuals from five families. Immunoblot analysis of mutant fibroblasts showed reduced protein levels of NBAS and its proposed interaction partner p31, both involved in retrograde transport between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. We recommend NBAS analysis in individuals with acute infantile liver failure, especially if triggered by fever.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26029869,Mutations in the unfolded protein response regulator ATF6 cause the cone dysfunction disorder achromatopsia.,"Achromatopsia (ACHM) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by color blindness, photophobia, nystagmus and severely reduced visual acuity. Using homozygosity mapping and whole-exome and candidate gene sequencing, we identified ten families carrying six homozygous and two compound-heterozygous mutations in the ATF6 gene (encoding activating transcription factor 6A), a key regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. Patients had evidence of foveal hypoplasia and disruption of the cone photoreceptor layer. The ACHM-associated ATF6 mutations attenuate ATF6 transcriptional activity in response to ER stress. Atf6(-/-) mice have normal retinal morphology and function at a young age but develop rod and cone dysfunction with increasing age. This new ACHM-related gene suggests a crucial and unexpected role for ATF6A in human foveal development and cone function and adds to the list of genes that, despite ubiquitous expression, when mutated can result in an isolated retinal photoreceptor phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26063662,Mutation of ATF6 causes autosomal recessive achromatopsia.,"Achromatopsia (ACHM) is an early-onset retinal dystrophy characterized by photophobia, nystagmus, color blindness and severely reduced visual acuity. Currently mutations in five genes CNGA3, CNGB3, GNAT2, PDE6C and PDE6H have been implicated in ACHM. We performed homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis in a consanguineous Pakistani ACHM family and mapped the locus to a 15.12-Mb region on chromosome 1q23.1-q24.3 with a maximum LOD score of 3.6. A DNA sample from an affected family member underwent exome sequencing. Within the ATF6 gene, a single-base insertion variant c.355_356dupG (p.Glu119Glyfs*8) was identified, which completely segregates with the ACHM phenotype within the family. The frameshift variant was absent in public variant databases, in 130 exomes from unrelated Pakistani individuals, and in 235 ethnically matched controls. The variant is predicted to result in a truncated protein that lacks the DNA binding and transmembrane domains and therefore affects the function of ATF6 as a transcription factor that initiates the unfolded protein response during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Immunolabeling with anti-ATF6 antibodies showed localization throughout the mouse neuronal retina, including retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptor cells, inner nuclear layer, inner and outer plexiform layers, with a more prominent signal in retinal ganglion cells. In contrast to cytoplasmic expression of wild-type protein, in heterologous cells ATF6 protein with the p.Glu119Glyfs*8 variant is mainly confined to the nucleus. Our results imply that response to ER stress as mediated by the ATF6 pathway is essential for color vision in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26072516,Loss of function mutations in HARS cause a spectrum of inherited peripheral neuropathies.,"Inherited peripheral neuropathies are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by distal muscle weakness and sensory loss. Mutations in genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been implicated in peripheral neuropathies, suggesting that these tRNA charging enzymes are uniquely important for the peripheral nerve. Recently, a mutation in histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HARS) was identified in a single patient with a late-onset, sensory-predominant peripheral neuropathy; however, the genetic evidence was lacking, making the significance of the finding unclear. Here, we present clinical, genetic, and functional data that implicate HARS mutations in inherited peripheral neuropathies. The associated phenotypic spectrum is broad and encompasses axonal and demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathies, including four young patients presenting with pure motor axonal neuropathy. Genome-wide linkage studies in combination with whole-exome and conventional sequencing revealed four distinct and previously unreported heterozygous HARS mutations segregating with autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy in four unrelated families (p.Thr132Ile, p.Pro134His, p.Asp175Glu and p.Asp364Tyr). All mutations cause a loss of function in yeast complementation assays, and p.Asp364Tyr is dominantly neurotoxic in a Caenorhabditis elegans model. This study demonstrates the role of HARS mutations in peripheral neuropathy and expands the genetic and clinical spectrum of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-related human disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
22961547,Early-onset Lafora body disease.,"The most common progressive myoclonus epilepsies are the late infantile and late infantile-variant neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (onset before the age of 6 years), Unverricht-Lundborg disease (onset after the age of 6 years) and Lafora disease. Lafora disease is a distinct disorder with uniform course: onset in teenage years, followed by progressively worsening myoclonus, seizures, visual hallucinations and cognitive decline, leading to a vegetative state in status myoclonicus and death within 10 years. Biopsy reveals Lafora bodies, which are pathognomonic and not seen with any other progressive myoclonus epilepsies. Lafora bodies are aggregates of polyglucosans, poorly constructed glycogen molecules with inordinately long strands that render them insoluble. Lafora disease is caused by mutations in the EPM2A or EPM2B genes, encoding the laforin phosphatase and the malin ubiquitin ligase, respectively, two cytoplasmically active enzymes that regulate glycogen construction, ensuring symmetric expansion into a spherical shape, essential to its solubility. In this work, we report a new progressive myoclonus epilepsy associated with Lafora bodies, early-onset Lafora body disease, map its locus to chromosome 4q21.21, identify its gene and mutation and characterize the relationship of its gene product with laforin and malin. Early-onset Lafora body disease presents early, at 5 years, with dysarthria, myoclonus and ataxia. The combination of early-onset and early dysarthria strongly suggests late infantile-variant neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, not Lafora disease. Pathology reveals no ceroid lipofuscinosis, but Lafora bodies. The subsequent course is a typical progressive myoclonus epilepsy, though much more protracted than any infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, or Lafora disease, patients living into the fourth decade. The mutation, c.781T>C (Phe261Leu), is in a gene of unknown function, PRDM8. We show that the PRDM8 protein interacts with laforin and malin and causes translocation of the two proteins to the nucleus. We find that Phe261Leu-PRDM8 results in excessive sequestration of laforin and malin in the nucleus and that it therefore likely represents a gain-of-function mutation that leads to an effective deficiency of cytoplasmic laforin and malin. We have identified a new progressive myoclonus epilepsy with Lafora bodies, early-onset Lafora body disease, 101 years after Lafora disease was first described. The results to date suggest that PRDM8, the early-onset Lafora body disease protein, regulates the cytoplasmic quantities of the Lafora disease enzymes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26333769,Mutations in SLC12A5 in epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures.,"The potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2, encoded by SLC12A5, plays a fundamental role in fast synaptic inhibition by maintaining a hyperpolarizing gradient for chloride ions. KCC2 dysfunction has been implicated in human epilepsy, but to date, no monogenic KCC2-related epilepsy disorders have been described. Here we show recessive loss-of-function SLC12A5 mutations in patients with a severe infantile-onset pharmacoresistant epilepsy syndrome, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS). Decreased KCC2 surface expression, reduced protein glycosylation and impaired chloride extrusion contribute to loss of KCC2 activity, thereby impairing normal synaptic inhibition and promoting neuronal excitability in this early-onset epileptic encephalopathy.","video-audio media; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26224535,Recessive ITPA mutations cause an early infantile encephalopathy.,"OBJECTIVE:To identify the etiology of a novel, heritable encephalopathy in a small group of patients. METHODS:Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern analysis was used to select patients with the same pattern. Homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed to find the causal gene mutations. RESULTS:Seven patients from 4 families (2 consanguineous) were identified with a similar MRI pattern characterized by T2 signal abnormalities and diffusion restriction in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, often also optic radiation, brainstem tracts, and cerebellar white matter, in combination with delayed myelination and progressive brain atrophy. Patients presented with early infantile onset encephalopathy characterized by progressive microcephaly, seizures, variable cardiac defects, and early death. Metabolic testing was unrevealing. Single nucleotide polymorphism array revealed 1 overlapping homozygous region on chromosome 20 in the consanguineous families. In all patients, WES subsequently revealed recessive predicted loss of function mutations in ITPA, encoding inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase). ITPase activity in patients' erythrocytes and fibroblasts was severely reduced. INTERPRETATION:Until now ITPA variants have only been associated with adverse reactions to specific drugs. This is the first report associating ITPA mutations with a human disorder. ITPase is important in purine metabolism because it removes noncanonical nucleotides from the cellular nucleotide pool. Toxicity of accumulated noncanonical nucleotides, leading to neuronal apoptosis and interference with proteins normally using adenosine triphosphate/guanosine triphosphate, probably explains the disease. This study confirms that combining MRI pattern recognition to define small, homogeneous patient groups with WES is a powerful approach for providing a fast diagnosis in patients with an unclassified genetic encephalopathy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
21349918,A clinically complex form of dominant optic atrophy (OPA8) maps on chromosome 16.,"Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is genetically heterogeneous and pathogenic mutations have been identified in the OPA1 and OPA3 genes, both encoding for mitochondrial proteins. We characterized clinical and laboratory features in a large OPA1-negative family with complicated DOA. Search for mitochondrial dysfunction was performed by studying muscle biopsies, fibroblasts, platelets and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy. Genetic investigations included mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis, linkage analysis, copy number variation (CNV) analysis and candidate gene screening. Optic neuropathy was undistinguishable from that in OPA1-DOA and frequently associated with late-onset sensorineural hearing loss, increases of central conduction times at somato-sensory evoked potentials and various cardiac abnormalities. Serum lactic acid after exercise, platelet respiratory complex activities, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in fibroblasts and muscle phosphorus MR spectroscopy all failed to reveal a mitochondrial dysfunction. However, muscle biopsies and their mtDNA analysis showed increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, patient's fibroblasts grown in the galactose medium were unable to increase ATP content compared with controls, and exhibited abnormally high rate of fusion activity. Genome-wide linkage revealed a locus on chromosome 16q21-q22 with a maximum two-point LOD score of 8.84 for the marker D16S752 and a non-recombinant interval of âˆ¼ 6.96 cM. Genomic screening of 45 genes in this interval including several likely candidate genes (CALB2, CYB5B, TK2, DHODH, PLEKHG4) revealed no mutation. Moreover, we excluded the presence of CNVs using array-based comparative genome hybridization. The identification of a new OPA locus (OPA8) in this pedigree demonstrates further genetic heterogeneity in DOA, and our results indicate that the pathogenesis may still involve mitochondria.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
19538529,Novel beta-spectrin mutations in hereditary spherocytosis associated with decreased levels of mRNA.,"Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is one of the most frequent and heterogeneous inherited haemolytic anaemias. It is associated with abnormalities of several erythrocyte membrane proteins. We investigated relative mRNA quantification of red blood cell membrane protein genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in order to better characterize HS cases and to select genes to search for mutations in patients with spherocytosis. qPCR experiments indicated that the spectrin beta gene (SPTB) could be involved in anaemia pathogenesis. DNA analysis of SPTB in the HS subjects with decreased SPTB mRNA levels revealed the presence of five previously undescribed mutations: R1756X, 781delT and IVS22nt-4G>A, 1502insA and IVS20nt-2A>G.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
11703334,beta-Spectrin S(ta) Bárbara: a novel frameshift mutation in hereditary spherocytosis associated with detectable levels of mRNA and a germ cell line mosaicism.,"Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited anaemia characterized by the presence of spherocytic red cells and by a heterogeneous nature in terms of its clinical presentation, molecular basis and inheritance. Defects in several membrane protein genes have been involved in the pathogenesis of HS, including defects in the beta-spectrin gene. We detected a novel frameshift mutation in the beta-spectrin gene, a C deletion at codon 638, in a patient presenting with HS and spectrin deficiency. The mutant protein was not detected in the membrane or in other cellular compartments, but detectable levels of mutant mRNA were found in the patient. Interestingly, this mutation was not present in the patient's parents, suggesting a genetic mosaicism, especially as the patient has an affected brother with the same molecular defect. We analysed DNA from different tissues of the parents and the mutation was absent from all tissues analysed. This mutation seems to be confined to the germ cell lineage of the patient's mother and must present a mosaic pattern in these cells as the patient also has unaffected siblings.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
6215583,A genetic defect in the binding of protein 4.1 to spectrin in a kindred with hereditary spherocytosis.,"Indirect evidence suggests that the genetic defect in hereditary spherocytosis lies in the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, a submembranous meshwork of proteins (principally spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1) responsible for membrane shape and structural stability. To test this premise we systematically assayed the interactions of spectrin, the major skeletal protein, in six kindreds with autosomal dominant hereditary spherocytosis. In one these kindreds, enhancement of spectrin-actin binding by protein 4.1 was reduced, owing to a 39 +/- 4 per cent decrease (mean +/- S.D) in the binding of normal protein 4.1 by spectrin, in all of four members with the disorder. The defective spectrin was separated into two populations by affinity chromatography on immobilized normal protein 4.1. One population (41 +/- 2 per cent) lacked the ability to bind 4.1, but the other functioned normally. Presumable, the nonfunctional spectrin was the product of the autosomal dominant gene responsible for the hereditary spherocytosis in this kindred.",review-article; review; journal article
16901296,The cognitive and behavioural phenotype of Roifman syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Roifman syndrome (OMIM 300258) is a multi-system disorder with a physical phenotype that includes Beta-cell immunodeficiency, intra-uterine and postnatal growth retardation, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, retinal dystrophy and characteristic facial dysmorphism. So far, six cases, all boys, have been reported in the literature. Roifman postulated that the syndrome may be due to a mutation in an X-linked gene or an autosomal gene giving rise to a sex-limited trait, but the definitive pathogenetic mechanism has still not been elucidated. Very little is known about the cognitive and behavioural phenotype of Roifman syndrome and no standardized measures of cognitive abilities have been reported. METHODS: We report the seventh case of a boy with Roifman syndrome and present the first systematic documentation of the cognitive and behavioural phenotype of an individual with the syndrome. RESULTS: In spite of having been reported as appearing intellectually 'able', formal evaluation showed very significant intellectual disability and neuropsychological impairment across cognitive domains. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that Roifman syndrome may be an example of an X-linked mental retardation syndrome (XLMRS).",journal article; case reports
26424569,Human IFNAR2 deficiency: Lessons for antiviral immunity.,"Type I interferon (IFN-α/β) is a fundamental antiviral defense mechanism. Mouse models have been pivotal to understanding the role of IFN-α/β in immunity, although validation of these findings in humans has been limited. We investigated a previously healthy child with fatal encephalitis after inoculation of the live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. By targeted resequencing, we identified a homozygous mutation in the high-affinity IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR2) in the proband, as well as a newborn sibling, that rendered cells unresponsive to IFN-α/β. Reconstitution of the proband's cells with wild-type IFNAR2 restored IFN-α/β responsiveness and control of IFN-attenuated viruses. Despite the severe outcome of systemic live vaccine challenge, the proband had previously shown no evidence of heightened susceptibility to respiratory viral pathogens. The phenotype of IFNAR2 deficiency, together with similar findings in STAT2-deficient patients, supports an essential but narrow role for IFN-α/β in human antiviral immunity.",review-article; review; journal article
27120463,A Founder Mutation in VPS11 Causes an Autosomal Recessive Leukoencephalopathy Linked to Autophagic Defects.,"Genetic leukoencephalopathies (gLEs) are a group of heterogeneous disorders with white matter abnormalities affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The causative mutation in ~50% of gLEs is unknown. Using whole exome sequencing (WES), we identified homozygosity for a missense variant, VPS11: c.2536T>G (p.C846G), as the genetic cause of a leukoencephalopathy syndrome in five individuals from three unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) families. All five patients exhibited highly concordant disease progression characterized by infantile onset leukoencephalopathy with brain white matter abnormalities, severe motor impairment, cortical blindness, intellectual disability, and seizures. The carrier frequency of the VPS11: c.2536T>G variant is 1:250 in the AJ population (n = 2,026). VPS11 protein is a core component of HOPS (homotypic fusion and protein sorting) and CORVET (class C core vacuole/endosome tethering) protein complexes involved in membrane trafficking and fusion of the lysosomes and endosomes. The cysteine 846 resides in an evolutionarily conserved cysteine-rich RING-H2 domain in carboxyl terminal regions of VPS11 proteins. Our data shows that the C846G mutation causes aberrant ubiquitination and accelerated turnover of VPS11 protein as well as compromised VPS11-VPS18 complex assembly, suggesting a loss of function in the mutant protein. Reduced VPS11 expression leads to an impaired autophagic activity in human cells. Importantly, zebrafish harboring a vps11 mutation with truncated RING-H2 domain demonstrated a significant reduction in CNS myelination following extensive neuronal death in the hindbrain and midbrain. Thus, our study reveals a defect in VPS11 as the underlying etiology for an autosomal recessive leukoencephalopathy disorder associated with a dysfunctional autophagy-lysosome trafficking pathway.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26307567,Hypomyelination and developmental delay associated with VPS11 mutation in Ashkenazi-Jewish patients.,"The genetic heterogeneity of developmental delay and cognitive impairment is vast. The endocytic network is essential for neural development and synaptic plasticity by regulating the sorting of numerous transmembrane proteins. Disruption of the pathway can lead to neuronal pathology. Endosomal biogenesis relies on two Rab proteins, Rab5 and Rab7, which bind to two hexameric tethering complexes, the endosomal class C core vacuole/endosome tethering complex (CORVET) and the late endosomal/lysosomal homotypic fusion and protein sorting complex (HOPS). Both complexes consist of four core proteins and differ by their specific Rab-binding proteins.To identify the molecular basis of a neurological disease, which consists of global developmental stagnation at 3-8 months, increasing appendicular spasticity, truncal hypotonia and acquired microcephaly, with variable seizure disorder, accompanied by thin corpus callosum, paucity of white matter and delayed myelination in eight patients from four unrelated Ashkenazi-Jewish (AJ) families.Exome analysis, homozygosity mapping and Mup1-GFP transport assay in mutant yeast.Homozygosity for a missense mutation, p.Cys846Gly, in one of the endosomal biogenesis core proteins, VPS11, was identified in all the patients. This was shown to be a founder mutation with a carrier frequency of 0.6% in the AJ population. The homologous yeast mutant had moderate impairment of fusion of the late endosome to the vacuole in Mup1-GFP transport assay.We speculate that in neuronal cells, impairment of fusion of the late endosome to the vacuole would attenuate the degradation of plasma membrane receptors, thereby underlying the progressive neuronal phenotype in our patients. The VPS11 p.Cys846Gly mutation should be added to the AJ carrier screening panel.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
24027061,SURF1 deficiency causes demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether mutations in the SURF1 gene are a cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. METHODS: We describe 2 patients from a consanguineous family with demyelinating autosomal recessive CMT disease (CMT4) associated with the homozygous splice site mutation c.107-2A>G in the SURF1 gene, encoding an assembly factor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV. This observation led us to hypothesize that mutations in SURF1 might be an unrecognized cause of CMT4, and we investigated SURF1 in a total of 40 unrelated patients with CMT4 after exclusion of mutations in known CMT4 genes. The functional impact of c.107-2A>G on splicing, amount of SURF1 protein, and on complex IV activity and assembly was analyzed. RESULTS: Another patient with CMT4 was found to harbor 2 additional SURF1 mutations. All 3 patients with SURF1-associated CMT4 presented with severe childhood-onset neuropathy, motor nerve conduction velocities <25 m/s, and lactic acidosis. Two patients had brain MRI abnormalities, including putaminal and periaqueductal lesions, and developed cerebellar ataxia years after polyneuropathy. The c.107-2A>G mutation produced no normally spliced transcript, leading to SURF1 absence. However, complex IV remained partially functional in muscle and fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: We found SURF1 mutations in 5% of families (2/41) presenting with CMT4. SURF1 should be systematically screened in patients with childhood-onset severe demyelinating neuropathy and additional features such as lactic acidosis, brain MRI abnormalities, and cerebellar ataxia developing years after polyneuropathy.",research-article; journal article
26522471,"Allelic Mutations of KITLG, Encoding KIT Ligand, Cause Asymmetric and Unilateral Hearing Loss and Waardenburg Syndrome Type 2.","Linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing in a large family with congenital and stable non-syndromic unilateral and asymmetric hearing loss (NS-UHL/AHL) revealed a heterozygous truncating mutation, c.286_303delinsT (p.Ser96Ter), in KITLG. This mutation co-segregated with NS-UHL/AHL as a dominant trait with reduced penetrance. By screening a panel of probands with NS-UHL/AHL, we found an additional mutation, c.200_202del (p.His67_Cys68delinsArg). In vitro studies revealed that the p.His67_Cys68delinsArg transmembrane isoform of KITLG is not detectable at the cell membrane, supporting pathogenicity. KITLG encodes a ligand for the KIT receptor. Also, KITLG-KIT signaling and MITF are suggested to mutually interact in melanocyte development. Because mutations in MITF are causative of Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2), we screened KITLG in suspected WS2-affected probands. A heterozygous missense mutation, c.310C>G (p.Leu104Val), that segregated with WS2 was identified in a small family. In vitro studies revealed that the p.Leu104Val transmembrane isoform of KITLG is located at the cell membrane, as is wild-type KITLG. However, in culture media of transfected cells, the p.Leu104Val soluble isoform of KITLG was reduced, and no soluble p.His67_Cys68delinsArg and p.Ser96Ter KITLG could be detected. These data suggest that mutations in KITLG associated with NS-UHL/AHL have a loss-of-function effect. We speculate that the mechanism of the mutation underlying WS2 and leading to membrane incorporation and reduced secretion of KITLG occurs via a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect. Our study unveils different phenotypes associated with KITLG, previously associated with pigmentation abnormalities, and will thereby improve the genetic counseling given to individuals with KITLG variants.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25941349,"A mutation of MET, encoding hepatocyte growth factor receptor, is associated with human DFNB97 hearing loss.","BACKGROUND:Hearing loss is a heterogeneous neurosensory disorder. Mutations of 56 genes are reported to cause recessively inherited non-syndromic deafness. OBJECTIVE:We sought to identify the genetic lesion causing hearing loss segregating in a large consanguineous Pakistani family. METHODS AND RESULTS:Mutations of GJB2 and all other genes reported to underlie recessive deafness were ruled out as the cause of the phenotype in the affected members of the participating family. Homozygosity mapping with a dense array of one million SNP markers allowed us to map the gene for recessively inherited severe hearing loss to chromosome 7q31.2, defining a new deafness locus designated DFNB97 (maximum logarithm of the odds score of 4.8). Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel missense mutation c.2521T>G (p.F841V) in MET (mesenchymal epithelial transition factor), which encodes the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor. The mutation cosegregated with the hearing loss phenotype in the family and was absent from 800 chromosomes of ethnically matched control individuals as well as from 136â€…602 chromosomes in public databases of nucleotide variants. Analyses by multiple prediction programmes indicated that p.F841V likely damages MET function. CONCLUSIONS:We identified a missense mutation of MET, encoding the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, as a likely cause of hearing loss in humans.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25816005,"HOMER2, a stereociliary scaffolding protein, is essential for normal hearing in humans and mice.","Hereditary hearing loss is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 80 genes have been implicated to date, and with the advent of targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE+MPS) the rate of novel deafness-gene identification has accelerated. Here we report a family segregating post-lingual progressive autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL). After first excluding plausible variants in known deafness-causing genes using TGE+MPS, we completed whole exome sequencing in three hearing-impaired family members. Only a single variant, p.Arg185Pro in HOMER2, segregated with the hearing-loss phenotype in the extended family. This amino acid change alters a highly conserved residue in the coiled-coil domain of HOMER2 that is essential for protein multimerization and the HOMER2-CDC42 interaction. As a scaffolding protein, HOMER2 is involved in intracellular calcium homeostasis and cytoskeletal organization. Consistent with this function, we found robust expression in stereocilia of hair cells in the murine inner ear and observed that over-expression of mutant p.Pro185 HOMER2 mRNA causes anatomical changes of the inner ear and neuromasts in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, mouse mutants homozygous for the targeted deletion of Homer2 present with early-onset rapidly progressive hearing loss. These data provide compelling evidence that HOMER2 is required for normal hearing and that its sequence alteration in humans leads to ADNSHL through a dominant-negative mode of action.","research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26264232,"WAC loss-of-function mutations cause a recognisable syndrome characterised by dysmorphic features, developmental delay and hypotonia and recapitulate 10p11.23 microdeletion syndrome.","Rare de novo mutations have been implicated as a significant cause of idiopathic intellectual disability. Large deletions encompassing 10p11.23 have been implicated in developmental delay, behavioural abnormalities and dysmorphic features, but the genotype-phenotype correlation was not delineated. Mutations in WAC have been recently reported in large screening cohorts of patients with intellectual disability or autism, but no full phenotypic characterisation was described.Clinical and molecular characterisation of six patients with loss-of-function WAC mutations identified by whole exome sequencing was performed. Clinical data were obtained by retrospective chart review, parental interviews, direct patient interaction and formal neuropsychological evaluation.Five heterozygous de novo WAC mutations were identified in six patients. Three of the mutations were nonsense, and two were frameshift; all are predicted to cause loss of function either through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or protein truncation. Clinical findings included developmental delay (6/6), hypotonia (6/6), behavioural problems (5/6), eye abnormalities (5/6), constipation (5/6), feeding difficulties (4/6), seizures (2/6) and sleep problems (2/6). All patients exhibited common dysmorphic features, including broad/prominent forehead, synophrys and/or bushy eyebrows, depressed nasal bridge and bulbous nasal tip. Posteriorly rotated ears, hirsutism, deep-set eyes, thin upper lip, inverted nipples, hearing loss and branchial cleft anomalies were also noted.Our case series show that loss-of-function mutations in WAC cause a recognisable genetic syndrome characterised by a neurocognitive phenotype and facial dysmorphism.

Congenital disorders of ciliary beating, referred to as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), are characterized by deficient mucociliary clearance and severe, recurrent respiratory infections. Numerous genetic defects, most of which can be detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are so far known to cause different abnormalities of the ciliary axoneme. However, some defects are not regularly discernable by TEM because the ciliary architecture of the axoneme remains preserved. This applies in particular to isolated defects of the nexin links, also known as the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), connecting the peripheral outer microtubular doublets. Immunofluorescence analyses of respiratory cells from PCD-affected individuals detected a N-DRC defect. Genome-wide exome sequence analyses identified recessive loss-of-function mutations in GAS8 encoding DRC4 in three independent PCD-affected families.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
26656649,Gene discovery for Mendelian conditions via social networking: de novo variants in KDM1A cause developmental delay and distinctive facial features.,"The pace of Mendelian gene discovery is slowed by the ""n-of-1 problem""-the difficulty of establishing the causality of a putatively pathogenic variant in a single person or family. Identification of an unrelated person with an overlapping phenotype and suspected pathogenic variant in the same gene can overcome this barrier, but it is often impeded by lack of a convenient or widely available way to share data on candidate variants/genes among families, clinicians, and researchers.Social networking among families, clinicians, and researchers was used to identify three children with variants of unknown significance in KDM1A and similar phenotypes.De novo variants in KDM1A underlie a new syndrome characterized by developmental delay and distinctive facial features.Social networking is a potentially powerful strategy to discover genes for rare Mendelian conditions, particularly those with nonspecific phenotypic features.

It has central functions in nucleocytoplasmic transport, nuclear framework, and gene regulation. Nucleoporin 107 kDa (NUP107) is a component of the NPC central scaffold and is an essential protein in all eukaryotic cells. Here, we report on biallelic NUP107 mutations in nine affected individuals who are from five unrelated families and show early-onset steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). These individuals have pathologically focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a condition that leads to end-stage renal disease with high frequency. NUP107 is ubiquitously expressed, including in glomerular podocytes. Three of four NUP107 mutations detected in the affected individuals hamper NUP107 binding to NUP133 (nucleoporin 133 kDa) and NUP107 incorporation into NPCs in vitro. Zebrafish with nup107 knockdown generated by morpholino oligonucleotides displayed hypoplastic glomerulus structures and abnormal podocyte foot processes, thereby mimicking the pathological changes seen in the kidneys of the SRNS individuals with NUP107 mutations. Considering the unique properties of the podocyte (highly differentiated foot-process architecture and slit membrane and the inability to regenerate), we propose a ""podocyte-injury model"" as the pathomechanism for SRNS due to biallelic NUP107 mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

In spite of intensive efforts, the genetic architecture of ET remains unknown. We used a combination of whole-exome sequencing and targeted resequencing in three ET families. In vitro and in vivo experiments in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and zebrafish were performed to test our findings. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a missense mutation in TENM4 segregating in an autosomal-dominant fashion in an ET family. Subsequent targeted resequencing of TENM4 led to the discovery of two novel missense mutations. Not only did these two mutations segregate with ET in two additional families, but we also observed significant over transmission of pathogenic TENM4 alleles across the three families. Consistent with a dominant mode of inheritance, in vitro analysis in oligodendrocyte precursor cells showed that mutant proteins mislocalize. Finally, expression of human mRNA harboring any of three patient mutations in zebrafish embryos induced defects in axon guidance, confirming a dominant-negative mode of action for these mutations. Our genetic and functional data, which is corroborated by the existence of a Tenm4 knockout mouse displaying an ET phenotype, implicates TENM4 in ET. Together with previous studies of TENM4 in model organisms, our studies intimate that processes regulating myelination in the central nervous system and axon guidance might be significant contributors to the genetic burden of this disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

The phenotype of mice lacking Cdc42 was strikingly similar to that of the reported patient, indicating that the mutation in CDC42 causes a new syndromic form of thrombocytopenia. We, herein, report another unrelated female patient with a similar phenotype and a de novo mutation in the same CDC42.

The enzyme histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) inactivates HA by transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to HA, and is the only well-known pathway for termination of neurotransmission actions of HA in mammalian central nervous system. We performed autozygosity mapping followed by targeted exome sequencing and identified two homozygous HNMT alterations, p.Gly60Asp and p.Leu208Pro, in patients affected with nonsyndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability from two unrelated consanguineous families of Turkish and Kurdish ancestry, respectively. We verified the complete absence of a functional HNMT in patients using in vitro toxicology assay. Using mutant and wild-type DNA constructs as well as in silico protein modeling, we confirmed that p.Gly60Asp disrupts the enzymatic activity of the protein, and that p.Leu208Pro results in reduced protein stability, resulting in decreased HA inactivation. Our results highlight the importance of inclusion of HNMT for genetic testing of individuals presenting with intellectual disability.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"

The substitution disrupts the TfR1 internalization motif, resulting in defective receptor endocytosis and markedly increased TfR1 expression on the cell surface. Iron citrate rescued the lymphocyte defects, and expression of wild-type but not mutant TfR1 rescued impaired transferrin uptake in patient-derived fibroblasts. Tfrc(Y20H/Y20H) mice recapitulated the immunological defects of patients. Despite the critical role of TfR1 in erythrocyte development and function, patients had only mild anemia and only slightly increased TfR1 expression in erythroid precursors. We show that STEAP3, a metalloreductase expressed in erythroblasts, associates with TfR1 and partially rescues transferrin uptake in patient-derived fibroblasts, suggesting that STEAP3 may provide an accessory TfR1 endocytosis signal that spares patients from severe anemia. These findings demonstrate the importance of TfR1 in adaptive immunity.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26642243,Loss-of-function mutations in TNFAIP3 leading to A20 haploinsufficiency cause an early-onset autoinflammatory disease.,"Systemic autoinflammatory diseases are driven by abnormal activation of innate immunity. Herein we describe a new disease caused by high-penetrance heterozygous germline mutations in TNFAIP3, which encodes the NF-κB regulatory protein A20, in six unrelated families with early-onset systemic inflammation. The disorder resembles Behçet's disease, which is typically considered a polygenic disorder with onset in early adulthood. A20 is a potent inhibitor of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Mutant, truncated A20 proteins are likely to act through haploinsufficiency because they do not exert a dominant-negative effect in overexpression experiments. Patient-derived cells show increased degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit together with increased expression of NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory cytokines. A20 restricts NF-κB signals via its deubiquitinase activity. In cells expressing mutant A20 protein, there is defective removal of Lys63-linked ubiquitin from TRAF6, NEMO and RIP1 after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF). NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory cytokines are potential therapeutic targets for the patients with this disease.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; multicenter study; journal article"

26424145,HACE1 deficiency causes an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental syndrome.,"BACKGROUND:The genetic aetiology of neurodevelopmental defects is extremely diverse, and the lack of distinctive phenotypic features means that genetic criteria are often required for accurate diagnostic classification. We aimed to identify the causative genetic lesions in two families in which eight affected individuals displayed variable learning disability, spasticity and abnormal gait. METHODS:Autosomal recessive inheritance was suggested by consanguinity in one family and by sibling recurrences with normal parents in the second. Autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, respectively, were used to identify the causative gene. RESULTS:In both families, biallelic loss-of-function mutations in HACE1 were identified. HACE1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the activity of cellular GTPases, including Rac1 and members of the Rab family. In the consanguineous family, a homozygous mutation p.R219* predicted a truncated protein entirely lacking its catalytic domain. In the other family, compound heterozygosity for nonsense mutation p.R748* and a 20-nt insertion interrupting the catalytic homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) domain was present; western blot analysis of patient cells revealed an absence of detectable HACE1 protein. CONCLUSION:HACE1 mutations underlie a new autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder. Previous studies have implicated HACE1 as a tumour suppressor gene; however, since cancer predisposition was not observed either in homozygous or heterozygous mutation carriers, this concept may require re-evaluation.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

The KRT25 variant is predicted to result in disruption of the second α-helical rod domain and the entire protein structure, thus possibly interfering with heterodimerisation of K25 with type II keratins within the inner root sheath (IRS) of the hair follicle and the medulla of the hair shaft.Our findings implicate a novel gene involved in human hair abnormality, and are consistent with the curled, fragile hair found in mice with Krt25 mutations, and further support the role of IRS-specific type I keratins in hair follicle development and maintenance of hair texture.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26902920,Autosomal Recessive Hypotrichosis with Woolly Hair Caused by a Mutation in the Keratin 25 Gene Expressed in Hair Follicles.,"Hypotrichosis is an abnormal condition characterized by decreased hair density and various defects in hair structure and growth patterns. In particular, in woolly hair, hypotrichosis is characterized by a tightly curled structure and abnormal growth. In this study, we present a detailed comparative examination of individuals affected by autosomal-recessive hypotrichosis (ARH), which distinguishes two types of ARH. Earlier, we demonstrated that exon 4 deletion in the lipase H gene caused an ARH (hypotrichosis 7; MIM: 604379) in populations of the Volga-Ural region of Russia. Screening for this mutation in all affected individuals revealed its presence only in the group with the hypotrichosis 7 phenotype. Other patients formed a separate group of woolly hair-associated ARH, with a homozygous missense mutation c.712G>T (p.Val238Leu) in a highly conserved position of type I keratin KRT25 (K25). Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. An expression study in the HaCaT cell line demonstrated a deleterious effect of the p.Val238Leu mutation on the formation of keratin intermediate filaments. Hence, we have identified a previously unreported missense mutation in the KRT25 gene causing ARH with woolly hair.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
26573021,Microcephaly-dystonia due to mutated PLEKHG2 with impaired actin polymerization.,"Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is controlled by RhoGTPases which are activated by RhoGEFs. We identified homozygosity for Arg204Trp mutation in the Rho guanidine exchange factor (RhoGEF) PLEKHG2 gene in five patients with profound mental retardation, dystonia, postnatal microcephaly, and distinct neuroimaging pattern. The activity of the mutant PLEKHG2 was significantly decreased, both in basal state and when Gβγ- or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-stimulated. SDF1a-stimulated actin polymerization was significantly impaired in patient cells, and this abnormality was duplicated in control cells when PLEKHG2 expression was downregulated. These results underscore the role of PLEKHG2 in actin polymerization and delineate the clinical and radiological findings in PLEKHG2 deficiency.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
26595769,TRAIP promotes DNA damage response during genome replication and is mutated in primordial dwarfism.,"DNA lesions encountered by replicative polymerases threaten genome stability and cell cycle progression. Here we report the identification of mutations in TRAIP, encoding an E3 RING ubiquitin ligase, in patients with microcephalic primordial dwarfism. We establish that TRAIP relocalizes to sites of DNA damage, where it is required for optimal phosphorylation of H2AX and RPA2 during S-phase in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, as well as fork progression through UV-induced DNA lesions. TRAIP is necessary for efficient cell cycle progression and mutations in TRAIP therefore limit cellular proliferation, providing a potential mechanism for microcephaly and dwarfism phenotypes. Human genetics thus identifies TRAIP as a component of the DNA damage response to replication-blocking DNA lesions.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26063658,Heterozygous HTRA1 mutations are associated with autosomal dominant cerebral small vessel disease.,"Cerebral small vessel disease represents a heterogeneous group of disorders leading to stroke and cognitive impairment. While most small vessel diseases appear sporadic and related to age and hypertension, several early-onset monogenic forms have also been reported. However, only a minority of patients with familial small vessel disease carry mutations in one of known small vessel disease genes. We used whole exome sequencing to identify candidate genes in an autosomal dominant small vessel disease family in which known small vessel disease genes had been excluded, and subsequently screened all candidate genes in 201 unrelated probands with a familial small vessel disease of unknown aetiology, using high throughput multiplex polymerase chain reaction and next generation sequencing. A heterozygous HTRA1 variant (R166L), absent from 1000 Genomes and Exome Variant Server databases and predicted to be deleterious by in silico tools, was identified in all affected members of the index family. Ten probands of 201 additional unrelated and affected probands (4.97%) harboured a heterozygous HTRA1 mutation predicted to be damaging. There was a highly significant difference in the number of likely deleterious variants in cases compared to controls (P = 4.2 × 10(-6); odds ratio = 15.4; 95% confidence interval = 4.9-45.5), strongly suggesting causality. Seven of these variants were located within or close to the HTRA1 protease domain, three were in the N-terminal domain of unknown function and one in the C-terminal PDZ domain. In vitro activity analysis of HTRA1 mutants demonstrated a loss of function effect. Clinical features of this autosomal dominant small vessel disease differ from those of CARASIL and CADASIL by a later age of onset and the absence of the typical extraneurological features of CARASIL. They are similar to those of sporadic small vessel disease, except for their familial nature. Our data demonstrate that heterozygous HTRA1 mutations are an important cause of familial small vessel disease, and that screening of HTRA1 should be considered in all patients with a hereditary small vessel disease of unknown aetiology.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
27273344,Mutations in TUBB8 cause a multiplicity of phenotypes in human oocytes and early embryos.,"TUBB8 is a primate-specific Î²-tubulin isotype whose expression is confined to oocytes and the early embryo. We previously found that mutations in TUBB8 caused oocyte maturation arrest. The objective was to describe newly discovered mutations in TUBB8 and to characterise the accompanying spectrum of phenotypes and modes of inheritance.Patients with oocyte maturation arrest were sequenced with respect to TUBB8. We investigated the effects of identified mutations in vitro, in cultured cells and in mouse oocytes. Seven heterozygous missense and two homozygous mutations were identified. These mutations cause a range of folding defects in vitro, different degrees of microtubule disruption upon expression in cultured cells and interfere to varying extents in the proper assembly of the meiotic spindle in mouse oocytes. Several of the newly discovered TUBB8 mutations result in phenotypic variability. For example, oocytes harbouring any of three missense mutations (I210V, T238M and N348S) could extrude the first polar body. Moreover, they could be fertilised, although the ensuing embryos became developmentally arrested. Surprisingly, oocytes from patients harbouring homozygous TUBB8 mutations that in either case preclude the expression of a functional TUBB8 polypeptide nonetheless contained identifiable spindles.Our data substantially expand the range of dysfunctional oocyte phenotypes incurred by mutation in TUBB8, underscore the independent nature of human oocyte meiosis and differentiation, extend the class of genetic diseases known as the tubulinopathies and provide new criteria for the qualitative evaluation of meiosis II (MII) oocytes for in vitro fertilization (IVF).","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26789871,Mutations in TUBB8 and Human Oocyte Meiotic Arrest.,"Background Human reproduction depends on the fusion of a mature oocyte with a sperm cell to form a fertilized egg. The genetic events that lead to the arrest of human oocyte maturation are unknown. Methods We sequenced the exomes of five members of a four-generation family, three of whom had infertility due to oocyte meiosis I arrest. We performed Sanger sequencing of a candidate gene, TUBB8, in DNA samples from these members, additional family members, and members of 23 other affected families. The expression of TUBB8 and all other β-tubulin isotypes was assessed in human oocytes, early embryos, sperm cells, and several somatic tissues by means of a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay. We evaluated the effect of the TUBB8 mutations on the assembly of the heterodimer consisting of one α-tubulin polypeptide and one β-tubulin polypeptide (α/β-tubulin heterodimer) in vitro, on microtubule architecture in HeLa cells, on microtubule dynamics in yeast cells, and on spindle assembly in mouse and human oocytes. Results We identified seven mutations in the primate-specific gene TUBB8 that were responsible for oocyte meiosis I arrest in 7 of the 24 families. TUBB8 expression is unique to oocytes and the early embryo, in which this gene accounts for almost all the expressed β-tubulin. The mutations affect chaperone-dependent folding and assembly of the α/β-tubulin heterodimer, disrupt microtubule behavior on expression in cultured cells, alter microtubule dynamics in vivo, and cause catastrophic spindle-assembly defects and maturation arrest on expression in mouse and human oocytes. Conclusions TUBB8 mutations have dominant-negative effects that disrupt microtubule behavior and oocyte meiotic spindle assembly and maturation, causing female infertility.

26714646,KIAA0556 is a novel ciliary basal body component mutated in Joubert syndrome.,"BACKGROUND:Joubert syndrome (JBTS) and related disorders are defined by cerebellar malformation (molar tooth sign), together with neurological symptoms of variable expressivity. The ciliary basis of Joubert syndrome related disorders frequently extends the phenotype to tissues such as the eye, kidney, skeleton and craniofacial structures. RESULTS:Using autozygome and exome analyses, we identified a null mutation in KIAA0556 in a multiplex consanguineous family with hallmark features of mild Joubert syndrome. Patient-derived fibroblasts displayed reduced ciliogenesis potential and abnormally elongated cilia. Investigation of disease pathophysiology revealed that Kiaa0556 (-/-) null mice possess a Joubert syndrome-associated brain-restricted phenotype. Functional studies in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes and cultured human cells support a conserved ciliary role for KIAA0556 linked to microtubule regulation. First, nematode KIAA0556 is expressed almost exclusively in ciliated cells, and the worm and human KIAA0556 proteins are enriched at the ciliary base. Second, C. elegans KIAA0056 regulates ciliary A-tubule number and genetically interacts with an ARL13B (JBTS8) orthologue to control cilium integrity. Third, human KIAA0556 binds to microtubules in vitro and appears to stabilise microtubule networks when overexpressed. Finally, human KIAA0556 biochemically interacts with ciliary proteins and p60/p80 katanins. The latter form a microtubule-severing enzyme complex that regulates microtubule dynamics as well as ciliary functions. CONCLUSIONS:We have identified KIAA0556 as a novel microtubule-associated ciliary base protein mutated in Joubert syndrome. Consistent with the mild patient phenotype, our nematode, mice and human cell data support the notion that KIAA0556 has a relatively subtle and variable cilia-related function, which we propose is related to microtubule regulation.",review-article; review; journal article
25954033,DLX4 is associated with orofacial clefting and abnormal jaw development.,"Cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) are common structural birth defects in humans. We used exome sequencing to study a patient with bilateral CL/P and identified a single nucleotide deletion in the patient and her similarly affected son—c.546_546delG, predicting p.Gln183Argfs*57 in the Distal-less 4 (DLX4) gene. The sequence variant was absent from databases, predicted to be deleterious and was verified by Sanger sequencing. In mammals, there are three Dlx homeobox clusters with closely located gene pairs (Dlx1/Dlx2, Dlx3/Dlx4, Dlx5/Dlx6). In situ hybridization showed that Dlx4 was expressed in the mesenchyme of the murine palatal shelves at E12.5, prior to palate closure. Wild-type human DLX4, but not mutant DLX4_c.546delG, could activate two murine Dlx conserved regulatory elements, implying that the mutation caused haploinsufficiency. We showed that reduced DLX4 expression after short interfering RNA treatment in a human cell line resulted in significant up-regulation of DLX3, DLX5 and DLX6, with reduced expression of DLX2 and significant up-regulation of BMP4, although the increased BMP4 expression was demonstrated only in HeLa cells. We used antisense morpholino oligonucleotides to target the orthologous Danio rerio gene, dlx4b, and found reduced cranial size and abnormal cartilaginous elements. We sequenced DLX4 in 155 patients with non-syndromic CL/P and CP, but observed no sequence variants. From the published literature, Dlx1/Dlx2 double homozygous null mice and Dlx5 homozygous null mice both have clefts of the secondary palate. This first finding of a DLX4 mutation in a family with CL/P establishes DLX4 as a potential cause of human clefts.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25758992,Redefining the MED13L syndrome.,"Congenital cardiac and neurodevelopmental deficits have been recently linked to the mediator complex subunit 13-like protein MED13L, a subunit of the CDK8-associated mediator complex that functions in transcriptional regulation through DNA-binding transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Heterozygous MED13L variants cause transposition of the great arteries and intellectual disability (ID). Here, we report eight patients with predominantly novel MED13L variants who lack such complex congenital heart malformations. Rather, they depict a syndromic form of ID characterized by facial dysmorphism, ID, speech impairment, motor developmental delay with muscular hypotonia and behavioral difficulties. We thereby define a novel syndrome and significantly broaden the clinical spectrum associated with MED13L variants. A prominent feature of the MED13L neurocognitive presentation is profound language impairment, often in combination with articulatory deficits.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26522469,Intra-mitochondrial Methylation Deficiency Due to Mutations in SLC25A26.,"S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the predominant methyl group donor and has a large spectrum of target substrates. As such, it is essential for nearly all biological methylation reactions. SAM is synthesized by methionine adenosyltransferase from methionine and ATP in the cytoplasm and subsequently distributed throughout the different cellular compartments, including mitochondria, where methylation is mostly required for nucleic-acid modifications and respiratory-chain function. We report a syndrome in three families affected by reduced intra-mitochondrial methylation caused by recessive mutations in the gene encoding the only known mitochondrial SAM transporter, SLC25A26. Clinical findings ranged from neonatal mortality resulting from respiratory insufficiency and hydrops to childhood acute episodes of cardiopulmonary failure and slowly progressive muscle weakness. We show that SLC25A26 mutations cause various mitochondrial defects, including those affecting RNA stability, protein modification, mitochondrial translation, and the biosynthesis of CoQ10 and lipoic acid.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
26456284,A Recurrent Mutation in CACNA1G Alters Cav3.1 T-Type Calcium-Channel Conduction and Causes Autosomal-Dominant Cerebellar Ataxia.,"Hereditary cerebellar ataxias (CAs) are neurodegenerative disorders clinically characterized by a cerebellar syndrome, often accompanied by other neurological or non-neurological signs. All transmission modes have been described. In autosomal-dominant CA (ADCA), mutations in more than 30 genes are implicated, but the molecular diagnosis remains unknown in about 40% of cases. Implication of ion channels has long been an ongoing topic in the genetics of CA, and mutations in several channel genes have been recently connected to ADCA. In a large family affected by ADCA and mild pyramidal signs, we searched for the causative variant by combining linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing. In CACNA1G, we identified a c.5144G>A mutation, causing an arginine-to-histidine (p.Arg1715His) change in the voltage sensor S4 segment of the T-type channel protein Cav3.1. Two out of 479 index subjects screened subsequently harbored the same mutation. We performed electrophysiological experiments in HEK293T cells to compare the properties of the p.Arg1715His and wild-type Cav3.1 channels. The current-voltage and the steady-state activation curves of the p.Arg1715His channel were shifted positively, whereas the inactivation curve had a higher slope factor. Computer modeling in deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) neurons suggested that the mutation results in decreased neuronal excitability. Taken together, these data establish CACNA1G, which is highly expressed in the cerebellum, as a gene whose mutations can cause ADCA. This is consistent with the neuropathological examination, which showed severe Purkinje cell loss. Our study further extends our knowledge of the link between calcium channelopathies and CAs.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
26708753,"Mutations in UNC80, Encoding Part of the UNC79-UNC80-NALCN Channel Complex, Cause Autosomal-Recessive Severe Infantile Encephalopathy.","Brain channelopathies represent a growing class of brain disorders that usually result in paroxysmal disorders, although their role in other neurological phenotypes, including the recently described NALCN-related infantile encephalopathy, is increasingly recognized. In three Saudi Arabian families and one Egyptian family all affected by a remarkably similar phenotype (infantile encephalopathy and largely normal brain MRI) to that of NALCN-related infantile encephalopathy, we identified a locus on 2q34 in which whole-exome sequencing revealed three, including two apparently loss-of-function, recessive mutations in UNC80. UNC80 encodes a large protein that is necessary for the stability and function of NALCN and for bridging NALCN to UNC79 to form a functional complex.

26708751,"Biallelic Mutations in UNC80 Cause Persistent Hypotonia, Encephalopathy, Growth Retardation, and Severe Intellectual Disability.","Ion channel proteins are required for both the establishment of resting membrane potentials and the generation of action potentials. Hundreds of mutations in genes encoding voltage-gated ion channels responsible for action potential generation have been found to cause severe neurological diseases. In contrast, the roles of voltage-independent ""leak"" channels, important for the establishment and maintenance of resting membrane potentials upon which action potentials are generated, are not well established in human disease. UNC80 is a large component of the NALCN sodium-leak channel complex that regulates the basal excitability of the nervous system. Loss-of-function mutations of NALCN cause infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies (IHPRF). We report four individuals from three unrelated families who have homozygous missense or compound heterozygous truncating mutations in UNC80 and persistent hypotonia, encephalopathy, growth failure, and severe intellectual disability. Compared to control cells, HEK293T cells transfected with an expression plasmid containing the c.5098C>T (p.Pro1700Ser) UNC80 mutation found in one individual showed markedly decreased NALCN channel currents.

Mild dysmorphism was evident: plagiocephaly, broad forehead with prominent nose, smooth philtrum and congenital esotropia. We set out to decipher the molecular basis of this syndrome.Genome-wide linkage analysis and fine mapping were done. Whole exome sequencing data were filtered for candidate variants within locus. Validation and segregation of the mutation was assayed via Sanger sequencing. UNC80 expression pattern was analysed through reverse transcription PCR.Homozygosity mapping followed by fine mapping identified a 7.5â€…Mb disease-associated locus (logarithm of odds score 3.5) on chromosome 2. Whole exome and Sanger sequencing identified a single homozygous nonsense mutation within this locus, segregating within the families as expected for recessive heredity and not found in a homozygous state in 150 Bedouin controls: c.151C>T, p.(R51*) in UNC80.The syndrome described is caused by a mutation in UNC80, truncating most of the 3258 amino acids highly conserved encoded protein, that has no known motifs. UNC80 bridges between UNC79 and the cation channel NALCN, enabling NALCN's role in basal Na(+) leak conductance in neurons, essential for neuronal function. The phenotype caused by the UNC80 mutation resembles that previously described for homozygous NALCN mutations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

26551668,Mutations in the transcriptional repressor REST predispose to Wilms tumor.,"Wilms tumor is the most common childhood renal cancer. To identify mutations that predispose to Wilms tumor, we are conducting exome sequencing studies. Here we describe 11 different inactivating mutations in the REST gene (encoding RE1-silencing transcription factor) in four familial Wilms tumor pedigrees and nine non-familial cases. Notably, no similar mutations were identified in the ICR1000 control series (13/558 versus 0/993; P < 0.0001) or in the ExAC series (13/558 versus 0/61,312; P < 0.0001). We identified a second mutational event in two tumors, suggesting that REST may act as a tumor-suppressor gene in Wilms tumor pathogenesis. REST is a zinc-finger transcription factor that functions in cellular differentiation and embryonic development. Notably, ten of 11 mutations clustered within the portion of REST encoding the DNA-binding domain, and functional analyses showed that these mutations compromise REST transcriptional repression. These data establish REST as a Wilms tumor predisposition gene accounting for âˆ¼2% of Wilms tumor.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26293662,Mutations in PIGY: expanding the phenotype of inherited glycosylphosphatidylinositol deficiencies.,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are ubiquitously expressed in the human body and are important for various functions at the cell surface. Mutations in many GPI biosynthesis genes have been described to date in patients with multi-system disease and together these constitute a subtype of congenital disorders of glycosylation. We used whole exome sequencing in two families to investigate the genetic basis of disease and used RNA and cellular studies to investigate the functional consequences of sequence variants in the PIGY gene. Two families with different phenotypes had homozygous recessive sequence variants in the GPI biosynthesis gene PIGY. Two sisters with c.137T>C (p.Leu46Pro) PIGY variants had multi-system disease including dysmorphism, seizures, severe developmental delay, cataracts and early death. There were significantly reduced levels of GPI-anchored proteins (CD55 and CD59) on the surface of patient-derived skin fibroblasts (âˆ¼20-50% compared with controls). In a second, consanguineous family, two siblings had moderate development delay and microcephaly. A homozygous PIGY promoter variant (c.-540G>A) was detected within a 7.7 Mb region of autozygosity. This variant was predicted to disrupt a SP1 consensus binding site and was shown to be associated with reduced gene expression. Mutations in PIGY can occur in coding and non-coding regions of the gene and cause variable phenotypes. This article contributes to understanding of the range of disease phenotypes and disease genes associated with deficiencies of the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway and also serves to highlight the potential importance of analysing variants detected in 5'-UTR regions despite their typically low coverage in exome data.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26626369,Human thioredoxin 2 deficiency impairs mitochondrial redox homeostasis and causes early-onset neurodegeneration.,"Thioredoxin 2 (TXN2; also known as Trx2) is a small mitochondrial redox protein essential for the control of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species homeostasis, apoptosis regulation and cell viability. Exome sequencing in a 16-year-old adolescent suffering from an infantile-onset neurodegenerative disorder with severe cerebellar atrophy, epilepsy, dystonia, optic atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy, uncovered a homozygous stop mutation in TXN2. Analysis of patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrated absence of TXN2 protein, increased reactive oxygen species levels, impaired oxidative stress defence and oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction. Reconstitution of TXN2 expression restored all these parameters, indicating the causal role of TXN2 mutation in disease development. Supplementation with antioxidants effectively suppressed cellular reactive oxygen species production, improved cell viability and mitigated clinical symptoms during short-term follow-up. In conclusion, our report on a patient with TXN2 deficiency suggests an important role of reactive oxygen species homeostasis for human neuronal maintenance and energy metabolism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
26642364,POPDC1(S201F) causes muscular dystrophy and arrhythmia by affecting protein trafficking.,"The Popeye domain-containing 1 (POPDC1) gene encodes a plasma membrane-localized cAMP-binding protein that is abundantly expressed in striated muscle. In animal models, POPDC1 is an essential regulator of structure and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle; however, POPDC1 mutations have not been associated with human cardiac and muscular diseases. Here, we have described a homozygous missense variant (c.602C>T, p.S201F) in POPDC1, identified by whole-exome sequencing, in a family of 4 with cardiac arrhythmia and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). This allele was absent in known databases and segregated with the pathological phenotype in this family. We did not find the allele in a further screen of 104 patients with a similar phenotype, suggesting this mutation to be family specific. Compared with WT protein, POPDC1(S201F) displayed a 50% reduction in cAMP affinity, and in skeletal muscle from patients, both POPDC1(S201F) and WT POPDC2 displayed impaired membrane trafficking. Forced expression of POPDC1(S201F) in a murine cardiac muscle cell line (HL-1) increased hyperpolarization and upstroke velocity of the action potential. In zebrafish, expression of the homologous mutation (popdc1(S191F)) caused heart and skeletal muscle phenotypes that resembled those observed in patients. Our study therefore identifies POPDC1 as a disease gene causing a very rare autosomal recessive cardiac arrhythmia and LGMD, expanding the genetic causes of this heterogeneous group of inherited rare diseases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26537248,TLE6 mutation causes the earliest known human embryonic lethality.,"Embryonic lethality is a recognized phenotypic expression of individual gene mutations in model organisms. However, identifying embryonic lethal genes in humans is challenging, especially when the phenotype is manifested at the preimplantation stage.In an ongoing effort to exploit the highly consanguineous nature of the Saudi population to catalog recessively acting embryonic lethal genes in humans, we have identified two families with a female-limited infertility phenotype. Using autozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing, we map this phenotype to a single mutation in TLE6, a maternal effect gene that encodes a member of the subcortical maternal complex in mammalian oocytes. Consistent with the published phenotype of mouse Tle6 mutants, embryos from female patients who are homozygous for the TLE6 mutation fail to undergo early cleavage, with resulting sterility. The human mutation abrogates TLE6 phosphorylation, a step that is reported to be critical for the PKA-mediated progression of oocyte meiosis II. Furthermore, the TLE6 mutation impairs its binding to components of the subcortical maternal complex.In this first report of a human defect in a member of the subcortical maternal subcritical maternal complex, we show that the TLE6 mutation is gender-specific and leads to the earliest known human embryonic lethality phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

Homozygosity mapping identified a single disease-associated locus of 3.5 Mb on chromosome 3. Studies of a Bedouin consanguineous kindred affected with a similar recessive phenotype identified a single disease-associated 18 Mb homozygosity locus encompassing the entire 3.5 Mb locus. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated only two homozygous mutations within a shared identical haplotype of 0.6 Mb, common to both Bedouin and Ethiopian affected individuals, suggesting an ancient common founder. Only one of the mutations segregated as expected in both kindreds and was not found in Bedouin and Jewish-Ethiopian controls: c.1404A>G, p.[*468Trpext*6] in CCDC174. We showed that CCDC174 is ubiquitous, restricted to the cell nucleus and co-localized with EIF4A3. In fact, yeast-two-hybrid assay demonstrated interaction of CCDC174 with EIF4A3, a component of exon junction complex. Knockdown of the CCDC174 ortholog in Xenopus laevis embryos resulted in poor neural fold closure at the neurula stage with later embryonic lethality. Knockdown embryos exhibited a sharp reduction in expression of n-tubulin, a marker for differentiating primary neurons, and of hindbrain markers krox20 and hoxb3. The Xenopus phenotype could be rescued by the human normal, yet not the mutant CCDC174 transcripts. Moreover, overexpression of mutant but not normal CCDC174 in neuroblastoma cells caused rapid apoptosis. In line with the hypotonia phenotype, the CCDC174 mutation caused depletion of RYR1 and marked myopathic changes in skeletal muscle of affected individuals.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

Our findings support the concept that dysregulated eIF2α phosphorylation, whether decreased by mutation of the kinase (EIF2AK3) in Wolcott-Rallison syndrome or increased by mutation of the phosphatase (PPP1R15B), is deleterious to β-cells and other secretory tissues, resulting in diabetes associated with multisystem abnormalities.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26307080,"Homozygous mutation in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha phosphatase gene, PPP1R15B, is associated with severe microcephaly, short stature and intellectual disability.","Protein translation is an essential cellular process initiated by the association of a methionyl-tRNA with the translation initiation factor eIF2. The Met-tRNA/eIF2 complex then associates with the small ribosomal subunit, other translation factors and mRNA, which together comprise the translational initiation complex. This process is regulated by the phosphorylation status of the α subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α); phosphorylated eIF2α attenuates protein translation. Here, we report a consanguineous family with severe microcephaly, short stature, hypoplastic brainstem and cord, delayed myelination and intellectual disability in two siblings. Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense mutation, c.1972G>A; p.Arg658Cys, in protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 15b (PPP1R15B), a protein which functions with the PPP1C phosphatase to maintain dephosphorylated eIF2α in unstressed cells. The p.R658C PPP1R15B mutation is located within the PPP1C binding site. We show that patient cells have greatly diminished levels of PPP1R15B-PPP1C interaction, which results in increased eIF2α phosphorylation and resistance to cellular stress. Finally, we find that patient cells have elevated levels of PPP1R15B mRNA and protein, suggesting activation of a compensatory program aimed at restoring cellular homeostasis which is ineffective due to PPP1R15B alteration. PPP1R15B now joins the expanding list of translation-associated proteins which when mutated cause rare genetic diseases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
25782674,A SPRY2 mutation leading to MAPK/ERK pathway inhibition is associated with an autosomal dominant form of IgA nephropathy.,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) represents the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide with a prevalence of 25-50% among patients with primary glomerulopathies. In ~5-10% of the patients the disease segregates with an autosomal dominant (AD) pattern. Association studies identified loci on chromosomes 1q32, 6p21, 8p23, 17p13, 22q12, whereas classical linkage studies on AD families identified loci on chromosomes 2q36, 4q26-31, 6q22, 17q12-22. We have studied a large Sicilian family where IgAN segregates with an AD transmission. To identify the causal gene, the exomes of two affected and one unaffected individual have been sequenced. From the bioinformatics analysis a p.(Arg119Trp) variant in the SPRY2 gene was identified as the probable disease-causing mutation. Moreover, functional characterization of this variant showed that it is responsible for the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway. The same effect was observed in two sporadic IgAN patients carriers of wild-type SPRY2, suggesting that downregulation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway represents a common mechanism leading to IgAN.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
25388005,"A syndrome of congenital microcephaly, intellectual disability and dysmorphism with a homozygous mutation in FRMD4A.","A consanguineous Bedouin Israeli kindred presented with a novel autosomal recessive intellectual disability syndrome of congenital microcephaly, low anterior hairline, bitemporal narrowing, low-set protruding ears, strabismus and tented thick eyebrows with sparse hair in their medial segment. Brain imaging demonstrated various degrees of agenesis of corpus callosum and hypoplasia of the vermis and cerebellum. Genome-wide linkage analysis followed by fine mapping defined a 7.67 Mb disease-associated locus (LOD score 4.99 at θ=0 for marker D10S1653). Sequencing of the 48 genes within the locus identified a single non-synonymous homozygous duplication frameshift mutation of 13 nucleotides (c.2134_2146dup13) within the coding region of FRMD4A, that was common to all affected individuals and not found in 180 non-related Bedouin controls. Three of 50 remotely related healthy controls of the same tribe were heterozygous for the mutation. FRMD4A, member of the FERM superfamily, is involved in cell structure, transport and signaling. It regulates cell polarity by playing an important role in the activation of ARF6, mediating the interaction between Par3 and the ARF6 guanine nucleotide exchange factor. ARF6 is known to modulate cell polarity in neurons, and regulates dendritic branching in hippocampal neurons and neurite outgrowth. The FRMD4 domain that is essential for determining cell polarity through interaction with Par3 is truncated by the c.2134_2146dup13 mutation. FRMD4A polymorphisms were recently suggested to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. We now show a homozygous frameshift mutation of the same gene in a severe neurologic syndrome with unique dysmorphism.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"

26833332,CCDC115 Deficiency Causes a Disorder of Golgi Homeostasis with Abnormal Protein Glycosylation.,"Disorders of Golgi homeostasis form an emerging group of genetic defects. The highly heterogeneous clinical spectrum is not explained by our current understanding of the underlying cell-biological processes in the Golgi. Therefore, uncovering genetic defects and annotating gene function are challenging. Exome sequencing in a family with three siblings affected by abnormal Golgi glycosylation revealed a homozygous missense mutation, c.92T>C (p.Leu31Ser), in coiled-coil domain containing 115 (CCDC115), the function of which is unknown. The same mutation was identified in three unrelated families, and in one family it was compound heterozygous in combination with a heterozygous deletion of CCDC115. An additional homozygous missense mutation, c.31G>T (p.Asp11Tyr), was found in a family with two affected siblings. All individuals displayed a storage-disease-like phenotype involving hepatosplenomegaly, which regressed with age, highly elevated bone-derived alkaline phosphatase, elevated aminotransferases, and elevated cholesterol, in combination with abnormal copper metabolism and neurological symptoms. Two individuals died of liver failure, and one individual was successfully treated by liver transplantation. Abnormal N- and mucin type O-glycosylation was found on serum proteins, and reduced metabolic labeling of sialic acids was found in fibroblasts, which was restored after complementation with wild-type CCDC115. PSI-BLAST homology detection revealed reciprocal homology with Vma22p, the yeast V-ATPase assembly factor located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Human CCDC115 mainly localized to the ERGIC and to COPI vesicles, but not to the ER. These data, in combination with the phenotypic spectrum, which is distinct from that associated with defects in V-ATPase core subunits, suggest a more general role for CCDC115 in Golgi trafficking. Our study reveals CCDC115 deficiency as a disorder of Golgi homeostasis that can be readily identified via screening for abnormal glycosylation in plasma.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26833330,"TMEM199 Deficiency Is a Disorder of Golgi Homeostasis Characterized by Elevated Aminotransferases, Alkaline Phosphatase, and Cholesterol and Abnormal Glycosylation.","Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) form a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of diseases with aberrant protein glycosylation as a hallmark. A subgroup of CDGs can be attributed to disturbed Golgi homeostasis. However, identification of pathogenic variants is seriously complicated by the large number of proteins involved. As part of a strategy to identify human homologs of yeast proteins that are known to be involved in Golgi homeostasis, we identified uncharacterized transmembrane protein 199 (TMEM199, previously called C17orf32) as a human homolog of yeast V-ATPase assembly factor Vph2p (also known as Vma12p). Subsequently, we analyzed raw exome-sequencing data from families affected by genetically unsolved CDGs and identified four individuals with different mutations in TMEM199. The adolescent individuals presented with a mild phenotype of hepatic steatosis, elevated aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase, and hypercholesterolemia, as well as low serum ceruloplasmin. Affected individuals showed abnormal N- and mucin-type O-glycosylation, and mass spectrometry indicated reduced incorporation of galactose and sialic acid, as seen in other Golgi homeostasis defects. Metabolic labeling of sialic acids in fibroblasts confirmed deficient Golgi glycosylation, which was restored by lentiviral transduction with wild-type TMEM199. V5-tagged TMEM199 localized with ERGIC and COPI markers in HeLa cells, and electron microscopy of a liver biopsy showed dilated organelles suggestive of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. In conclusion, we have identified TMEM199 as a protein involved in Golgi homeostasis and show that TMEM199 deficiency results in a hepatic phenotype with abnormal glycosylation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
24852293,Mutations in SETD2 cause a novel overgrowth condition.,"BACKGROUND: Overgrowth conditions are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by increased growth and variable features, including macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and various degrees of learning difficulties and intellectual disability. Among them, Sotos and Weaver syndromes are clinically well defined and due to heterozygous mutations in NSD1 and EZH2, respectively. NSD1 and EZH2 are both histone-modifying enzymes. These two epigenetic writers catalyse two specific post-translational modifications of histones: methylation of histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36) and lysine 27 (H3K27). We postulated that mutations in writers of these two chromatin marks could cause overgrowth conditions, resembling Sotos or Weaver syndromes, in patients with no NSD1 or EZH2 abnormalities. METHODS: We analysed the coding sequences of 14 H3K27 methylation-related genes and eight H3K36 methylation-related genes using a targeted next-generation sequencing approach in three Sotos, 11 'Sotos-like' and two Weaver syndrome patients. RESULTS: We identified two heterozygous mutations in the SETD2 gene in two patients with 'Sotos-like' syndrome: one missense p.Leu1815Trp de novo mutation in a boy and one nonsense p.Gln274* mutation in an adopted girl. SETD2 is non-redundantly responsible for H3K36 trimethylation. The two probands shared similar clinical features, including postnatal overgrowth, macrocephaly, obesity, speech delay and advanced carpal ossification. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the power of targeted next-generation sequencing to identify rare disease-causing variants. We provide a compelling argument for Sotos and Sotos-like syndromes as epigenetic diseases caused by loss-of-function mutations of epigenetic writers of the H3K36 histone mark.",journal article
26849110,ZNF687 Mutations in Severe Paget Disease of Bone Associated with Giant Cell Tumor.,"Paget disease of bone (PDB) is a skeletal disorder characterized by focal abnormalities of bone remodeling, which result in enlarged and deformed bones in one or more regions of the skeleton. In some cases, the pagetic tissue undergoes neoplastic transformation, resulting in osteosarcoma and, less frequently, in giant cell tumor of bone (GCT). We performed whole-exome sequencing in a large family with 14 PDB-affected members, four of whom developed GCT at multiple pagetic skeletal sites, and we identified the c.2810C>G (p.Pro937Arg) missense mutation in the zinc finger protein 687 gene (ZNF687). The mutation precisely co-segregated with the clinical phenotype in all affected family members. The sequencing of seven unrelated individuals with GCT associated with PDB (GCT/PDB) identified the same mutation in all individuals, unravelling a founder effect. ZNF687 is highly expressed during osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis and is dramatically upregulated in the tumor tissue of individuals with GCT/PDB. Interestingly, our preliminary findings showed that ZNF687, indicated as a target gene of the NFkB transcription factor by ChIP-seq analysis, is also upregulated in the peripheral blood of PDB-affected individuals with (n = 5) or without (n = 6) mutations in SQSTM1, encouraging additional studies to investigate its potential role as a biomarker of PDB risk.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article"
21285510,"Mutations in the human SC4MOL gene  encoding a methyl sterol oxidase cause  psoriasiform dermatitis, microcephaly,  and developmental delay.","Defects in cholesterol synthesis result in a wide variety of symptoms, from neonatal lethality to the relatively mild dysmorphic features and developmental delay found in individuals with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. We report here the identification of mutations in sterol-C4-methyl oxidase–like gene (SC4MOL) as the cause of an autosomal recessive syndrome in a human patient with psoriasiform dermatitis, arthralgias, congenital cataracts, microcephaly, and developmental delay. This gene encodes a sterol-C4-methyl oxidase (SMO), which catalyzes demethylation of C4-methylsterols in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. C4-Methylsterols are meiosis-activating sterols (MASs). They exist at high concentrations in the testis and ovary and play roles in meiosis activation. In this study, we found that an accumulation of MASs in the patient led to cell overproliferation in both skin and blood. SMO deficiency also substantially altered immunocyte phenotype and in vitro function. MASs serve as ligands for liver X receptors α and β(LXRα and LXRβ), which are important in regulating not only lipid transport in the epidermis, but also innate and adaptive immunity. Deficiency of SMO represents a biochemical defect in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, the clinical spectrum of which remains to be defined.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26637980,De Novo GMNN Mutations Cause Autosomal-Dominant Primordial Dwarfism Associated with Meier-Gorlin Syndrome.,"Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS) is a genetically heterogeneous primordial dwarfism syndrome known to be caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in one of five genes encoding pre-replication complex proteins: ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6. Mutations in these genes cause disruption of the origin of DNA replication initiation. To date, only an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern has been described in individuals with this disorder, with a molecular etiology established in about three-fourths of cases. Here, we report three subjects with MGS and de novo heterozygous mutations in the 5' end of GMNN, encoding the DNA replication inhibitor geminin. We identified two truncating mutations in exon 2 (the 1(st) coding exon), c.16A>T (p.Lys6(∗)) and c.35_38delTCAA (p.Ile12Lysfs(∗)4), and one missense mutation, c.50A>G (p.Lys17Arg), affecting the second-to-last nucleotide of exon 2 and possibly RNA splicing. Geminin is present during the S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle and is degraded during the metaphase-anaphase transition by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which recognizes the destruction box sequence near the 5' end of the geminin protein. All three GMNN mutations identified alter sites 5' to residue Met28 of the protein, which is located within the destruction box. We present data supporting a gain-of-function mechanism, in which the GMNN mutations result in proteins lacking the destruction box and hence increased protein stability and prolonged inhibition of replication leading to autosomal-dominant MGS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26942284,Loss of VPS13C Function in Autosomal-Recessive Parkinsonism Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Increases PINK1/Parkin-Dependent Mitophagy.,"Autosomal-recessive early-onset parkinsonism is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. The genetic causes of approximately 50% of autosomal-recessive early-onset forms of Parkinson disease (PD) remain to be elucidated. Homozygozity mapping and exome sequencing in 62 isolated individuals with early-onset parkinsonism and confirmed consanguinity followed by data mining in the exomes of 1,348 PD-affected individuals identified, in three isolated subjects, homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutations in vacuolar protein sorting 13C (VPS13C). VPS13C mutations are associated with a distinct form of early-onset parkinsonism characterized by rapid and severe disease progression and early cognitive decline; the pathological features were striking and reminiscent of diffuse Lewy body disease. In cell models, VPS13C partly localized to the outer membrane of mitochondria. Silencing of VPS13C was associated with lower mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial fragmentation, increased respiration rates, exacerbated PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, and transcriptional upregulation of PARK2 in response to mitochondrial damage. This work suggests that loss of function of VPS13C is a cause of autosomal-recessive early-onset parkinsonism with a distinctive phenotype of rapid and severe progression.",brief-report; journal article
26333996,Novel mutations in PIEZO1 cause an autosomal recessive generalized lymphatic dysplasia with non-immune hydrops fetalis.,"Generalized lymphatic dysplasia (GLD) is a rare form of primary lymphoedema characterized by a uniform, widespread lymphoedema affecting all segments of the body, with systemic involvement such as intestinal and/or pulmonary lymphangiectasia, pleural effusions, chylothoraces and/or pericardial effusions. This may present prenatally as non-immune hydrops. Here we report homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in PIEZO1, resulting in an autosomal recessive form of GLD with a high incidence of non-immune hydrops fetalis and childhood onset of facial and four limb lymphoedema. Mutations in PIEZO1, which encodes a mechanically activated ion channel, have been reported with autosomal dominant dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis and non-immune hydrops of unknown aetiology.

25758993,Two novel disease-causing variants in BMPR1B are associated with brachydactyly type A1.,"Brachydactyly type A1 is an autosomal dominant disorder primarily characterized by hypoplasia/aplasia of the middle phalanges of digits 2-5. Human and mouse genetic perturbations in the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway have been associated with many brachymesophalangies, including BDA1, as causative mutations in IHH and GDF5 have been previously identified. GDF5 interacts directly as the preferred ligand for the BMP type-1 receptor BMPR1B and is important for both chondrogenesis and digit formation. We report pathogenic variants in BMPR1B that are associated with complex BDA1. A c.975A>C (p.(Lys325Asn)) was identified in the first patient displaying absent middle phalanges and shortened distal phalanges of the toes in addition to the significant shortening of middle phalanges in digits 2, 3 and 5 of the hands. The second patient displayed a combination of brachydactyly and arachnodactyly. The sequencing of BMPR1B in this individual revealed a novel c.447-1G>A at a canonical acceptor splice site of exon 8, which is predicted to create a novel acceptor site, thus leading to a translational reading frameshift. Both mutations are most likely to act in a dominant-negative manner, similar to the effects observed in BMPR1B mutations that cause BDA2. These findings demonstrate that BMPR1B is another gene involved with the pathogenesis of BDA1 and illustrates the continuum of phenotypes between BDA1 and BDA2.",research-article; journal article
25804400,SIPA1L3 identified by linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing as a novel gene for autosomal recessive congenital cataract.,"Congenital cataract (CC) is one of the most important causes for blindness or visual impairment in infancy. A substantial proportion of isolated CCs has monogenic causes. The disease is genetically heterogeneous, and all Mendelian modes of inheritance have been reported. We mapped a locus for isolated CC on 19p13.1-q13.2 in a distantly consanguineous German family with two sisters affected by dense white cataracts. Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous nonsense variant c.4489C>T (p.(R1497*)) in SIPA1L3 (signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 like 3) in both affected children. SIPA1L3 encodes a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which interacts with small GTPases of the Rap family via its Rap-GAP-domain. The suggested role of Rap GTPases in cell growth, differentiation and organization of the cytoskeleton in the human lens, and lens-enriched expression of the murine ortholog gene Sipa1l3 in embryonic mice indicates that this gene is crucial for early lens development. Our results provide evidence that sequence variants in human SIPA1L3 cause autosomal recessive isolated CC and give new insight into the molecular pathogenesis underlying human cataracts.",research-article; journal article
25938801,Association of a Novel ACTA1 Mutation With a Dominant Progressive Scapuloperoneal Myopathy in an Extended Family.,"IMPORTANCE:New genomic strategies can now be applied to identify a diagnosis in patients and families with previously undiagnosed rare genetic conditions. The large family evaluated in the present study was described in 1966 and now expands the phenotype of a known neuromuscular gene. OBJECTIVE:To determine the genetic cause of a slowly progressive, autosomal dominant, scapuloperoneal neuromuscular disorder by using linkage and exome sequencing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:Fourteen affected individuals in a 6-generation family with a progressive scapuloperoneal disorder were evaluated. Participants were examined at pediatric, neuromuscular, and research clinics from March 1, 2005, to May 31, 2014. Exome and linkage were performed in genetics laboratories of research institutions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:Examination and evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, electrodiagnostic studies, and muscle biopsies (n = 3). Genetic analysis included linkage analysis (n = 17) with exome sequencing (n = 7). RESULTS:Clinical findings included progressive muscle weakness in an initially scapuloperoneal and distal distribution, including wrist extensor weakness, finger and foot drop, scapular winging, mild facial weakness, Achilles tendon contractures, and diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes. Both age at onset and progression of the disease showed clinical variability within the family. Muscle biopsy specimens demonstrated type I fiber atrophy and trabeculated fibers without nemaline rods. Analysis of exome sequences within the linkage region (4.8 megabases) revealed missense mutation c.591C>A p.Glu197Asp in a highly conserved residue in exon 4 of ACTA1. The mutation cosegregated with disease in all tested individuals and was not present in unaffected individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:This family defines a new scapuloperoneal phenotype associated with an ACTA1 mutation. A highly conserved protein, ACTA1 is implicated in multiple muscle diseases, including nemaline myopathy, actin aggregate myopathy, fiber-type disproportion, and rod-core myopathy. To our knowledge, mutations in Glu197 have not been reported previously. This residue is highly conserved and located in an exposed position in the protein; the mutation affects the intermolecular and intramolecular electrostatic interactions as shown by structural modeling. The mutation in this residue does not appear to lead to rod formation or actin accumulation in vitro or in vivo, suggesting a different molecular mechanism from that of other ACTA1 diseases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural; observational study"

Here, we delineate a similar but distinct condition that shares the epiphyseal, vertebral and ocular changes of CODAS but also included severe microtia, nasal hypoplasia, and other malformations, and for which we propose the name of EVEN-PLUS syndrome for epiphyseal, vertebral, ear, nose, plus associated findings. In three individuals from two families, no mutation in LONP1 was found; instead, we found biallelic mutations in HSPA9, the gene that codes for mHSP70/mortalin, another highly conserved mitochondrial chaperone protein essential in mitochondrial protein import, folding, and degradation. The functional relationship between LONP1 and HSPA9 in mitochondrial protein chaperoning and the overlapping phenotypes of CODAS and EVEN-PLUS delineate a family of ""mitochondrial chaperonopathies"" and point to an unexplored role of mitochondrial chaperones in human embryonic morphogenesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26522472,Germline Heterozygous Variants in SEC23B Are Associated with Cowden Syndrome and Enriched in Apparently Sporadic Thyroid Cancer.,"Cancer-predisposing genes associated with inherited cancer syndromes help explain mechanisms of sporadic carcinogenesis and often inform normal development. Cowden syndrome (CS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by high lifetime risks of epithelial cancers, such that âˆ¼50% of affected individuals are wild-type for known cancer-predisposing genes. Using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing of a multi-generation CS family affected by thyroid and other cancers, we identified a pathogenic missense heterozygous SEC23B variant (c.1781T>G [p.Val594Gly]) that segregates with the phenotype. We also found germline heterozygous SEC23B variants in 3/96 (3%) unrelated mutation-negative CS probands with thyroid cancer and in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), representing apparently sporadic cancers. We note that the TCGA thyroid cancer dataset is enriched with unique germline deleterious SEC23B variants associated with a significantly younger age of onset. SEC23B encodes Sec23 homolog B (S. cerevisiae), a component of coat protein complex II (COPII), which transports proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. Interestingly, germline homozygous or compound-heterozygous SEC23B mutations cause an unrelated disorder, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II, and SEC23B-deficient mice suffer from secretory organ degeneration due to ER-stress-associated apoptosis. By characterizing the p.Val594Gly variant in a normal thyroid cell line, we show that it is a functional alteration that results in ER-stress-mediated cell-colony formation and survival, growth, and invasion, which reflect aspects of a cancer phenotype. Our findings suggest a different role for SEC23B, whereby germline heterozygous variants associate with cancer predisposition potentially mediated by ER stress ""addiction.""","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
24334290,"Variant non ketotic hyperglycinemia is caused by mutations in LIAS, BOLA3 and the novel gene GLRX5.","Patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia and deficient glycine cleavage enzyme activity, but without mutations in AMT, GLDC or GCSH, the genes encoding its constituent proteins, constitute a clinical group which we call 'variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia'. We hypothesize that in some patients the aetiology involves genetic mutations that result in a deficiency of the cofactor lipoate, and sequenced genes involved in lipoate synthesis and iron-sulphur cluster biogenesis. Of 11 individuals identified with variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia, we were able to determine the genetic aetiology in eight patients and delineate the clinical and biochemical phenotypes. Mutations were identified in the genes for lipoate synthase (LIAS), BolA type 3 (BOLA3), and a novel gene glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5). Patients with GLRX5-associated variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia had normal development with childhood-onset spastic paraplegia, spinal lesion, and optic atrophy. Clinical features of BOLA3-associated variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia include severe neurodegeneration after a period of normal development. Additional features include leukodystrophy, cardiomyopathy and optic atrophy. Patients with lipoate synthase-deficient variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia varied in severity from mild static encephalopathy to Leigh disease and cortical involvement. All patients had high serum and borderline elevated cerebrospinal fluid glycine and cerebrospinal fluid:plasma glycine ratio, and deficient glycine cleavage enzyme activity. They had low pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity but most did not have lactic acidosis. Patients were deficient in lipoylation of mitochondrial proteins. There were minimal and inconsistent changes in cellular iron handling, and respiratory chain activity was unaffected. Identified mutations were phylogenetically conserved, and transfection with native genes corrected the biochemical deficiency proving pathogenicity. Treatments of cells with lipoate and with mitochondrially-targeted lipoate were unsuccessful at correcting the deficiency. The recognition of variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia is important for physicians evaluating patients with abnormalities in glycine as this will affect the genetic causation and genetic counselling, and provide prognostic information on the expected phenotypic course.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

17485548,The human counterpart of zebrafish shiraz shows sideroblastic-like microcytic anemia and iron overload.,"Inherited microcytic-hypochromic anemias in rodents and zebrafish suggest the existence of corresponding human disorders. The zebrafish mutant shiraz has severe anemia and is embryonically lethal because of glutaredoxin 5 (GRLX5) deletion, insufficient biogenesis of mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, and deregulated iron-regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) activity. This leads to stabilization of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR) RNA, repression of ferritin, and ALA-synthase 2 (ALAS2) translation with impaired heme synthesis. We report the first case of GLRX5 deficiency in a middle-aged anemic male with iron overload and a low number of ringed sideroblasts. Anemia was worsened by blood transfusions but partially reversed by iron chelation. The patient had a homozygous (c.294A>G) mutation that interferes with intron 1 splicing and drastically reduces GLRX5 RNA. As in shiraz, aconitase and H-ferritin levels were low and TfR level was high in the patient's cells, compatible with increased IRP1 binding. Based on the biochemical and clinical phenotype, we hypothesize that IRP2, less degraded by low heme, contributes to the repression of the erythroblasts ferritin and ALAS2, increasing mitochondrial iron. Iron chelation, redistributing iron to the cytosol, might relieve IRP2 excess, improving heme synthesis and anemia. GLRX5 function is highly conserved, but at variance with zebrafish, its defect in humans leads to anemia and iron overload.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
26365382,USP7 Acts as a Molecular Rheostat to Promote WASH-Dependent Endosomal Protein Recycling and Is Mutated in a Human Neurodevelopmental Disorder.,"Endosomal protein recycling is a fundamental cellular process important for cellular homeostasis, signaling, and fate determination that is implicated in several diseases. WASH is an actin-nucleating protein essential for this process, and its activity is controlled through K63-linked ubiquitination by the MAGE-L2-TRIM27 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we show that the USP7 deubiquitinating enzyme is an integral component of the MAGE-L2-TRIM27 ligase and is essential for WASH-mediated endosomal actin assembly and protein recycling. Mechanistically, USP7 acts as a molecular rheostat to precisely fine-tune endosomal F-actin levels by counteracting TRIM27 auto-ubiquitination/degradation and preventing overactivation of WASH through directly deubiquitinating it. Importantly, we identify de novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of USP7 in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder, featuring intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. These results provide unanticipated insights into endosomal trafficking, illuminate the cooperativity between an ubiquitin ligase and a deubiquitinating enzyme, and establish a role for USP7 in human neurodevelopmental disease.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26924529,Mutations in Subunits of the Activating Signal Cointegrator 1 Complex Are Associated with Prenatal Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Congenital Bone Fractures.,"Transcriptional signal cointegrators associate with transcription factors or nuclear receptors and coregulate tissue-specific gene transcription. We report on recessive loss-of-function mutations in two genes (TRIP4 and ASCC1) that encode subunits of the nuclear activating signal cointegrator 1 (ASC-1) complex. We used autozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing to search for pathogenic mutations in four families. Affected individuals presented with prenatal-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), multiple congenital contractures (arthrogryposis multiplex congenita), respiratory distress, and congenital bone fractures. We identified homozygous and compound-heterozygous nonsense and frameshift TRIP4 and ASCC1 mutations that led to a truncation or the entire absence of the respective proteins and cosegregated with the disease phenotype. Trip4 and Ascc1 have identical expression patterns in 17.5-day-old mouse embryos with high expression levels in the spinal cord, brain, paraspinal ganglia, thyroid, and submandibular glands. Antisense morpholino-mediated knockdown of either trip4 or ascc1 in zebrafish disrupted the highly patterned and coordinated process of α-motoneuron outgrowth and formation of myotomes and neuromuscular junctions and led to a swimming defect in the larvae. Immunoprecipitation of the ASC-1 complex consistently copurified cysteine and glycine rich protein 1 (CSRP1), a transcriptional cofactor, which is known to be involved in spinal cord regeneration upon injury in adult zebrafish. ASCC1 mutant fibroblasts downregulated genes associated with neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and pathfinding (SERPINF1, DAB1, SEMA3D, SEMA3A), as well as with bone development (TNFRSF11B, RASSF2, STC1). Our findings indicate that the dysfunction of a transcriptional coactivator complex can result in a clinical syndrome affecting the neuromuscular system.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26358773,Reduced sodium/proton exchanger NHE3 activity causes congenital sodium diarrhea.,"Congenital sodium diarrhea (CSD) refers to an intractable diarrhea of intrauterine onset with high fecal sodium loss. CSD is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Syndromic CSD is caused by SPINT2 mutations. While we recently described four cases of the non-syndromic form of CSD that were caused by dominant activating mutations in intestinal receptor guanylate cyclase C (GC-C), the genetic cause for the majority of CSD is still unknown. Therefore, we aimed to determine the genetic cause for non-GC-C non-syndromic CSD in 18 patients from 16 unrelated families applying whole-exome sequencing and/or chromosomal microarray analyses and/or direct Sanger sequencing. SLC9A3 missense, splicing and truncation mutations, including an instance of uniparental disomy, and whole-gene deletion were identified in nine patients from eight families with CSD. Two of these nine patients developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at 4 and 16 years of age. SLC9A3 encodes Na(+)/H(+) antiporter 3 (NHE3), which is the major intestinal brush-border Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. All mutations were in the NHE3 N-terminal transport domain, and all missense mutations were in the putative membrane-spanning domains. Identified SLC9A3 missense mutations were functionally characterized in plasma membrane NHE null fibroblasts. SLC9A3 missense mutations compromised NHE3 activity by reducing basal surface expression and/or loss of basal transport function of NHE3 molecules, whereas acute regulation was normal. This study identifies recessive mutations in NHE3, a downstream target of GC-C, as a cause of CSD and implies primary basal NHE3 malfunction as a predisposition for IBD in a subset of patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26712909,Novel germ line DDX41 mutations define families with a lower age of MDS/AML onset and lymphoid malignancies.,"Recently our group and others have identified DDX41 mutations both as germ line and acquired somatic mutations in families with multiple cases of late onset myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that DDX41 acts as a tumor suppressor. To determine whether novel DDX41 mutations could be identified in families with additional types of hematologic malignancies, our group screened two cohorts of families with a diverse range of hematologic malignancy subtypes. Among 289 families, we identified nine (3%) with DDX41 mutations. As previously observed, MDS and AML were the most common malignancies, often of the erythroblastic subtype, and 1 family displayed early-onset follicular lymphoma. Five novel mutations were identified, including missense mutations within important functional domains and start-loss and splicing mutations predicted to result in truncated proteins. We also show that most asymptomatic mutation carriers have normal blood counts until malignancy develops. This study expands both the mutation and phenotypic spectra observed in families with germ line DDX41 mutations. With an increasing number of both inherited and acquired mutations in this gene being identified, further study of how DDX41 disruption leads to hematologic malignancies is critical.","letter; research support, non-u.s. gov't"
25920683,Inherited and Somatic Defects in DDX41 in Myeloid Neoplasms.,"Most cases of adult myeloid neoplasms are routinely assumed to be sporadic. Here, we describe an adult familial acute myeloid leukemia (AML) syndrome caused by germline mutations in the DEAD/H-box helicase gene DDX41. DDX41 was also found to be affected by somatic mutations in sporadic cases of myeloid neoplasms as well as in a biallelic fashion in 50% of patients with germline DDX41 mutations. Moreover, corresponding deletions on 5q35.3 present in 6% of cases led to haploinsufficient DDX41 expression. DDX41 lesions caused altered pre-mRNA splicing and RNA processing. DDX41 is exemplary of other RNA helicase genes also affected by somatic mutations, suggesting that they constitute a family of tumor suppressor genes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26981933,Loss of B Cells in Patients with Heterozygous Mutations in IKAROS.,"BACKGROUND:Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia in the absence of predisposing factors. The genetic cause is unknown in the majority of cases, and less than 10% of patients have a family history of the disease. Most patients have normal numbers of B cells but lack plasma cells. METHODS:We used whole-exome sequencing and array-based comparative genomic hybridization to evaluate a subset of patients with CVID and low B-cell numbers. Mutant proteins were analyzed for DNA binding with the use of an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) and confocal microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to analyze peripheral-blood lymphocytes and bone marrow aspirates. RESULTS:Six different heterozygous mutations in IKZF1, the gene encoding the transcription factor IKAROS, were identified in 29 persons from six families. In two families, the mutation was a de novo event in the proband. All the mutations, four amino acid substitutions, an intragenic deletion, and a 4.7-Mb multigene deletion involved the DNA-binding domain of IKAROS. The proteins bearing missense mutations failed to bind target DNA sequences on EMSA and confocal microscopy; however, they did not inhibit the binding of wild-type IKAROS. Studies in family members showed progressive loss of B cells and serum immunoglobulins. Bone marrow aspirates in two patients had markedly decreased early B-cell precursors, but plasma cells were present. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed in 2 of the 29 patients. CONCLUSIONS:Heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor IKAROS caused an autosomal dominant form of CVID that is associated with a striking decrease in B-cell numbers.

26942288,"Monoallelic and Biallelic Variants in EMC1 Identified in Individuals with Global Developmental Delay, Hypotonia, Scoliosis, and Cerebellar Atrophy.","The paradigm of a single gene associated with one specific phenotype and mode of inheritance has been repeatedly challenged. Genotype-phenotype correlations can often be traced to different mutation types, localization of the variants in distinct protein domains, or the trigger of or escape from nonsense-mediated decay. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified homozygous variants in EMC1 that segregated with a phenotype of developmental delay, hypotonia, scoliosis, and cerebellar atrophy in three families. In addition, a de novo heterozygous EMC1 variant was seen in an individual with a similar clinical and MRI imaging phenotype. EMC1 encodes a member of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane protein complex (EMC), an evolutionarily conserved complex that has been proposed to have multiple roles in ER-associated degradation, ER-mitochondria tethering, and proper assembly of multi-pass transmembrane proteins. Perturbations of protein folding and organelle crosstalk have been implicated in neurodegenerative processes including cerebellar atrophy. We propose EMC1 as a gene in which either biallelic or monoallelic variants might lead to a syndrome including intellectual disability and preferential degeneration of the cerebellum.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

Using exome sequencing, we identified bi-allelic mutations in TANGO2 encoding transport and Golgi organization 2 homolog (Drosophila) in 12 subjects with episodic rhabdomyolysis, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and susceptibility to life-threatening cardiac tachyarrhythmias. A recurrent homozygous c.460G>A (p.Gly154Arg) mutation was found in four unrelated individuals of Hispanic/Latino origin, and a homozygous âˆ¼34 kb deletion affecting exons 3-9 was observed in two families of European ancestry. One individual of mixed Hispanic/European descent was found to be compound heterozygous for c.460G>A (p.Gly154Arg) and the deletion of exons 3-9. Additionally, a homozygous exons 4-6 deletion was identified in a consanguineous Middle Eastern Arab family. No homozygotes have been reported for these changes in control databases. Fibroblasts derived from a subject with the recurrent c.460G>A (p.Gly154Arg) mutation showed evidence of increased endoplasmic reticulum stress and a reduction in Golgi volume density in comparison to control. Our results show that the c.460G>A (p.Gly154Arg) mutation and the exons 3-9 heterozygous deletion in TANGO2 are recurrent pathogenic alleles present in the Latino/Hispanic and European populations, respectively, causing considerable morbidity in the homozygotes in these populations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26805782,Bi-allelic Truncating Mutations in TANGO2 Cause Infancy-Onset Recurrent Metabolic Crises with Encephalocardiomyopathy.,"Molecular diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders is challenging because of extreme clinical and genetic heterogeneity. By exome sequencing, we identified three different bi-allelic truncating mutations in TANGO2 in three unrelated individuals with infancy-onset episodic metabolic crises characterized by encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, rhabdomyolysis, arrhythmias, and laboratory findings suggestive of a defect in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Over the course of the disease, all individuals developed global brain atrophy with cognitive impairment and pyramidal signs. TANGO2 (transport and Golgi organization 2) encodes a protein with a putative function in redistribution of Golgi membranes into the endoplasmic reticulum in Drosophila and a mitochondrial localization has been confirmed in mice. Investigation of palmitate-dependent respiration in mutant fibroblasts showed evidence of a functional defect in mitochondrial β-oxidation.

26566883,Homozygous missense mutation in the LMAN2L gene segregates with intellectual disability in a large consanguineous Pakistani family.,"Intellectual disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1%-3% of the population worldwide. It is characterised by high phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity and in most cases the underlying cause of the disorder is unknown. In our study we investigated a large consanguineous family from Baluchistan, Pakistan, comprising seven affected individuals with a severe form of autosomal recessive ID (ARID) and epilepsy, to elucidate a putative genetic cause.Whole exome sequencing (WES) of a trio, including a child with ID and epilepsy and its healthy parents that were part of this large family, revealed a homozygous missense variant p.R53Q in the lectin mannose-binding 2-like (LMAN2L) gene. This homozygous variant was co-segregating in the family with the phenotype of severe ID and infantile epilepsy; unaffected family members were heterozygous variant carriers. The variant was predicted to be pathogenic by five different in silico programmes and further three-dimensional structure modelling of the protein suggests that variant p.R53Q may impair protein-protein interaction. LMAN2L (OMIM: 609552) encodes for the lectin, mannose-binding 2-like protein which is a cargo receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum important for glycoprotein transport. Genome-wide association studies have identified an association of LMAN2L to different neuropsychiatric disorders.This is the first report linking LMAN2L to a phenotype of severe ARID and seizures, indicating that the deleterious homozygous p.R53Q variant very likely causes the disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
26878725,"Mutations in nuclear pore genes NUP93, NUP205 and XPO5 cause steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.","Nucleoporins are essential components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Only a few diseases have been attributed to NPC dysfunction. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), a frequent cause of chronic kidney disease, is caused by dysfunction of glomerular podocytes. Here we identify in eight families with SRNS mutations in NUP93, its interaction partner NUP205 or XPO5 (encoding exportin 5) as hitherto unrecognized monogenic causes of SRNS. NUP93 mutations caused disrupted NPC assembly. NUP93 knockdown reduced the presence of NUP205 in the NPC, and, reciprocally, a NUP205 alteration abrogated NUP93 interaction. We demonstrate that NUP93 and exportin 5 interact with the signaling protein SMAD4 and that NUP93 mutations abrogated interaction with SMAD4. Notably, NUP93 mutations interfered with BMP7-induced SMAD transcriptional reporter activity. We hereby demonstrate that mutations of NUP genes cause a distinct renal disease and identify aberrant SMAD signaling as a new disease mechanism of SRNS, opening a potential new avenue for treatment.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26561570,"Fatal infantile mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and optic atrophy associated with a homozygous OPA1 mutation.","BACKGROUND:Infantile-onset encephalopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation defects are genetically heterogeneous with defects involving both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. OBJECTIVE:To identify the causative genetic defect in two sisters presenting with lethal infantile encephalopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and optic atrophy. METHODS:We describe a comprehensive clinical, biochemical and molecular genetic investigation of two affected siblings from a consanguineous family. Molecular genetic analysis was done by a combined approach involving genome-wide autozygosity mapping and next-generation exome sequencing. Biochemical analysis was done by enzymatic analysis and Western blot. Evidence for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) instability was investigated using long-range and real-time PCR assays. Mitochondrial cristae morphology was assessed with transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS:Both affected sisters presented with a similar cluster of neurodevelopmental deficits marked by failure to thrive, generalised neuromuscular weakness and optic atrophy. The disease progression was ultimately fatal with severe encephalopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activities were globally decreased in skeletal muscle biopsies. They were found to be homozygous for a novel c.1601T>G (p.Leu534Arg) mutation in the OPA1 gene, which resulted in a marked loss of steady-state levels of the native OPA1 protein. We observed severe mtDNA depletion in DNA extracted from the patients' muscle biopsies. Mitochondrial morphology was consistent with abnormal mitochondrial membrane fusion. CONCLUSIONS:We have established, for the first time, a causal link between a pathogenic homozygous OPA1 mutation and human disease. The fatal multisystemic manifestations observed further extend the complex phenotype associated with pathogenic OPA1 mutations, in particular the previously unreported association with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our findings further emphasise the vital role played by OPA1 in mitochondrial biogenesis and mtDNA maintenance.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
26365339,Genetic Defects in TAPT1 Disrupt Ciliogenesis and Cause a Complex Lethal Osteochondrodysplasia.,"The evolutionarily conserved transmembrane anterior posterior transformation 1 protein, encoded by TAPT1, is involved in murine axial skeletal patterning, but its cellular function remains unknown. Our study demonstrates that TAPT1 mutations underlie a complex congenital syndrome, showing clinical overlap between lethal skeletal dysplasias and ciliopathies. This syndrome is characterized by fetal lethality, severe hypomineralization of the entire skeleton and intra-uterine fractures, and multiple congenital developmental anomalies affecting the brain, lungs, and kidneys. We establish that wild-type TAPT1 localizes to the centrosome and/or ciliary basal body, whereas defective TAPT1 mislocalizes to the cytoplasm and disrupts Golgi morphology and trafficking and normal primary cilium formation. Knockdown of tapt1b in zebrafish induces severe craniofacial cartilage malformations and delayed ossification, which is shown to be associated with aberrant differentiation of cranial neural crest cells.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
27040692,"Recessive Inactivating Mutations in TBCK, Encoding a Rab GTPase-Activating Protein, Cause Severe Infantile Syndromic Encephalopathy.","Infantile encephalopathies are a group of clinically and biologically heterogeneous disorders for which the genetic basis remains largely unknown. Here, we report a syndromic neonatal encephalopathy characterized by profound developmental disability, severe hypotonia, seizures, diminished respiratory drive requiring mechanical ventilation, brain atrophy, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and facial dysmorphism. Biallelic inactivating mutations in TBCK (TBC1-domain-containing kinase) were independently identified by whole-exome sequencing as the cause of this condition in four unrelated families. Matching these families was facilitated by the sharing of phenotypic profiles and WES data in a recently released web-based tool (Geno2MP) that links phenotypic information to rare variants in families with Mendelian traits. TBCK is a putative GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for small GTPases of the Rab family and has been shown to control cell growth and proliferation, actin-cytoskeleton dynamics, and mTOR signaling. Two of the three mutations (c.376C>T [p.Arg126(∗)] and c.1363A>T [p.Lys455(∗)]) are predicted to truncate the protein, and loss of the major TBCK isoform was confirmed in primary fibroblasts from one affected individual. The third mutation, c.1532G>A (p.Arg511His), alters a conserved residue within the TBC1 domain. Structural analysis implicated Arg511 as a required residue for Rab-GAP function, and in silico homology modeling predicted impaired GAP function in the corresponding mutant. These results suggest that loss of Rab-GAP activity is the underlying mechanism of disease. In contrast to other disorders caused by dysregulated mTOR signaling associated with focal or global brain overgrowth, impaired TBCK function results in progressive loss of brain volume.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

All affected individuals were found to share a core phenotype of intellectual disability and hypotonia, and many had seizures and showed brain atrophy and white-matter changes on neuroimaging. Minor non-specific facial dysmorphism was also noted in some individuals, including multiple older children who developed coarse features similar to those of storage disorders. TBCK has been shown to regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which is also stimulated by exogenous leucine supplementation. TBCK was absent in cells from affected individuals, and decreased phosphorylation of phospho-ribosomal protein S6 was also observed, a finding suggestive of downregulation of mTOR signaling. Lastly, we demonstrated that activation of the mTOR pathway in response to L-leucine supplementation was retained, suggesting a possible avenue for directed therapies for this condition.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

The phenotypic analysis was then extended using the DECIPHER database. We followed up association using an autism patient cohort (n = 3,143) compared with six additional control groups (n = 6,469). In the clinical discovery series, we identified eight cases with ELP4 deletions, and one with a partial duplication of ELP4 and PAX6. These cases were referred for neurological phenotypes including language impairment, developmental delay, autism, and epilepsy. Six further cases with a primary diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and similar secondary phenotypes were identified with ELP4 deletions, as well as another six (out of nine) with neurodevelopmental phenotypes from DECIPHER. CNVs at ELP4 were only present in 1/11,252 controls. We found a significant excess of CNVs in discovery cases compared with controls, P = 7.5 × 10(-3) , as well as for autism, P = 2.7 × 10(-3) .

27153400,Mutations in CAPN1 Cause Autosomal-Recessive Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia.,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease characterized by spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs with or without additional neurological symptoms. Although more than 70 genes and genetic loci have been implicated in HSP, many families remain genetically undiagnosed, suggesting that other genetic causes of HSP are still to be identified. HSP can be inherited in an autosomal-dominant, autosomal-recessive, or X-linked manner. In the current study, we performed whole-exome sequencing to analyze a total of nine affected individuals in three families with autosomal-recessive HSP. Rare homozygous and compound-heterozygous nonsense, missense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations in CAPN1 were identified in all affected individuals, and sequencing in additional family members confirmed the segregation of these mutations with the disease (spastic paraplegia 76 [SPG76]). CAPN1 encodes calpain 1, a protease that is widely present in the CNS. Calpain 1 is involved in synaptic plasticity, synaptic restructuring, and axon maturation and maintenance. Three models of calpain 1 deficiency were further studied. In Caenorhabditis elegans, loss of calpain 1 function resulted in neuronal and axonal dysfunction and degeneration. Similarly, loss-of-function of the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog calpain B caused locomotor defects and axonal anomalies. Knockdown of calpain 1a, a CAPN1 ortholog in Danio rerio, resulted in abnormal branchiomotor neuron migration and disorganized acetylated-tubulin axonal networks in the brain. The identification of mutations in CAPN1 in HSP expands our understanding of the disease causes and potential mechanisms.",review-article; review; journal article

She lacked insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, and diabetes. Mutation analysis in the gene encoding fibrillin 1 (FBN1) revealed a novel de novo heterozygous deletion, c.8155_8156del2 in exon 64. The severe generalized lipodystrophy in this patient with progeroid features has not previously been described in other patients with MFS and FBN1 mutations. We did not find a mutation in genes known to be associated with congenital lipodystrophy (APGAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, PTRF-CAVIN, PPARG, LMNB2) or with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (ZMPSTE24, LMNA/C). Other progeria syndromes were considered unlikely because premature greying, hypogonadism, and scleroderma-like skin disease were not present. Our patient shows striking similarity to two patients who have been published in this journal by O'Neill et al. [O'Neill et al. (2007); Am J Med Genet Part A 143A:1421-1430] with the diagnosis of neonatal progeroid syndrome (NPS). This condition also known as Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by accelerated aging and lipodystrophy from birth, poor postnatal weight gain, and characteristic facial features. The course is usually progressive with early lethality. However this entity seems heterogeneous.

27018474,"Mutations in SMG9, Encoding an Essential Component of Nonsense-Mediated Decay Machinery, Cause a Multiple Congenital Anomaly Syndrome in Humans and Mice.","Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is an important process that is best known for degrading transcripts that contain premature stop codons (PTCs) to mitigate their potentially harmful consequences, although its regulatory role encompasses other classes of transcripts as well. Despite the critical role of NMD at the cellular level, our knowledge about the consequences of deficiency of its components at the organismal level is largely limited to model organisms. In this study, we report two consanguineous families in which a similar pattern of congenital anomalies was found to be most likely caused by homozygous loss-of-function mutations in SMG9, encoding an essential component of the SURF complex that generates phospho-UPF1, the single most important step in NMD. By knocking out Smg9 in mice via CRISPR/Cas9, we were able to recapitulate the major features of the SMG9-related multiple congenital anomaly syndrome we observed in humans. Surprisingly, human cells devoid of SMG9 do not appear to have reduction of PTC-containing transcripts but do display global transcriptional dysregulation. We conclude that SMG9 is required for normal human and murine development, most likely through a transcriptional regulatory role, the precise nature of which remains to be determined.",research-article; journal article
27058446,Biallelic Mutations in PDE10A Lead to Loss of Striatal PDE10A and a Hyperkinetic Movement Disorder with Onset in Infancy.,"Deficits in the basal ganglia pathways modulating cortical motor activity underlie both Parkinson disease (PD) and Huntington disease (HD). Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is enriched in the striatum, and animal data suggest that it is a key regulator of this circuitry. Here, we report on germline PDE10A mutations in eight individuals from two families affected by a hyperkinetic movement disorder due to homozygous mutations c.320A>G (p.Tyr107Cys) and c.346G>C (p.Ala116Pro). Both mutations lead to a reduction in PDE10A levels in recombinant cellular systems, and critically, positron-emission-tomography (PET) studies with a specific PDE10A ligand confirmed that the p.Tyr107Cys variant also reduced striatal PDE10A levels in one of the affected individuals. A knock-in mouse model carrying the homologous p.Tyr97Cys variant had decreased striatal PDE10A and also displayed motor abnormalities. Striatal preparations from this animal had an impaired capacity to degrade cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and a blunted pharmacological response to PDE10A inhibitors. These observations highlight the critical role of PDE10A in motor control across species.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
27058447,De Novo Mutations in PDE10A Cause Childhood-Onset Chorea with Bilateral Striatal Lesions.,"Chorea is a hyperkinetic movement disorder resulting from dysfunction of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which form the main output projections from the basal ganglia. Here, we used whole-exome sequencing to unravel the underlying genetic cause in three unrelated individuals with a very similar and unique clinical presentation of childhood-onset chorea and characteristic brain MRI showing symmetrical bilateral striatal lesions. All individuals were identified to carry a de novo heterozygous mutation in PDE10A (c.898T>C [p.Phe300Leu] in two individuals and c.1000T>C [p.Phe334Leu] in one individual), encoding a phosphodiesterase highly and selectively present in MSNs. PDE10A contributes to the regulation of the intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Both substitutions affect highly conserved amino acids located in the regulatory GAF-B domain, which, by binding to cAMP, stimulates the activity of the PDE10A catalytic domain. In silico modeling showed that the altered residues are located deep in the binding pocket, where they are likely to alter cAMP binding properties. In vitro functional studies showed that neither substitution affects the basal PDE10A activity, but they severely disrupt the stimulatory effect mediated by cAMP binding to the GAF-B domain. The identification of PDE10A mutations as a cause of chorea further motivates the study of cAMP signaling in MSNs and highlights the crucial role of striatal cAMP signaling in the regulation of basal ganglia circuitry. Pharmacological modulation of this pathway could offer promising etiologically targeted treatments for chorea and other hyperkinetic movement disorders.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
27040688,Cryptic Amyloidogenic Elements in the 3' UTRs of Neurofilament Genes Trigger Axonal Neuropathy.,"Abnormal protein aggregation is observed in an expanding number of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we describe a mechanism for intracellular toxic protein aggregation induced by an unusual mutation event in families affected by axonal neuropathy. These families carry distinct frameshift variants in NEFH (neurofilament heavy), leading to a loss of the terminating codon and translation of the 3' UTR into an extra 40 amino acids. In silico aggregation prediction suggested the terminal 20 residues of the altered NEFH to be amyloidogenic, which we confirmed experimentally by serial deletion analysis. The presence of this amyloidogenic motif fused to NEFH caused prominent and toxic protein aggregates in transfected cells and disrupted motor neurons in zebrafish. We identified a similar aggregation-inducing mechanism in NEFL (neurofilament light) and FUS (fused in sarcoma), in which mutations are known to cause aggregation in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, respectively. In summary, we present a protein-aggregation-triggering mechanism that should be taken into consideration during the evaluation of stop-loss variants.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26936507,"A dominant gain-of-function mutation in universal tyrosine kinase SRC causes thrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis, bleeding, and bone pathologies.","The Src family kinase (SFK) member SRC is a major target in drug development because it is activated in many human cancers, yet deleterious SRC germline mutations have not been reported. We used genome sequencing and Human Phenotype Ontology patient coding to identify a gain-of-function mutation in SRC causing thrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis, bleeding, and bone pathologies in nine cases. Modeling of the E527K substitution predicts loss of SRC's self-inhibitory capacity, which we confirmed with in vitro studies showing increased SRC kinase activity and enhanced Tyr(419) phosphorylation in COS-7 cells overexpressing E527K SRC. The active form of SRC predominates in patients' platelets, resulting in enhanced overall tyrosine phosphorylation. Patients with myelofibrosis have hypercellular bone marrow with trilineage dysplasia, and their stem cells grown in vitro form more myeloid and megakaryocyte (MK) colonies than control cells. These MKs generate platelets that are dysmorphic, low in number, highly variable in size, and have a paucity of α-granules. Overactive SRC in patient-derived MKs causes a reduction in proplatelet formation, which can be rescued by SRC kinase inhibition. Stem cells transduced with lentiviral E527K SRC form MKs with a similar defect and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation levels. Patient-derived and E527K-transduced MKs show Y419 SRC-positive stained podosomes that induce altered actin organization. Expression of mutated src in zebrafish recapitulates patients' blood and bone phenotypes. Similar studies of platelets and MKs may reveal the mechanism underlying the severe bleeding frequently observed in cancer patients treated with next-generation SFK inhibitors.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
23906836,A comprehensive molecular study on Coffin-Siris and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndromes identifies a broad molecular and clinical spectrum converging on altered chromatin remodeling.,"Chromatin remodeling complexes are known to modify chemical marks on histones or to induce conformational changes in the chromatin in order to regulate transcription. De novo dominant mutations in different members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex have recently been described in individuals with Coffin-Siris (CSS) and Nicolaides-Baraitser (NCBRS) syndromes. Using a combination of whole-exome sequencing, NGS-based sequencing of 23 SWI/SNF complex genes, and molecular karyotyping in 46 previously undescribed individuals with CSS and NCBRS, we identified a de novo 1-bp deletion (c.677delG, p.Gly226Glufs*53) and a de novo missense mutation (c.914G>T, p.Cys305Phe) in PHF6 in two individuals diagnosed with CSS. PHF6 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex implicating dysfunction of a second chromatin remodeling complex in the pathogenesis of CSS-like phenotypes. Altogether, we identified mutations in 60% of the studied individuals (28/46), located in the genes ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCB1, SMARCE1, SMARCA2, and PHF6. We show that mutations in ARID1B are the main cause of CSS, accounting for 76% of identified mutations. ARID1B and SMARCB1 mutations were also found in individuals with the initial diagnosis of NCBRS. These individuals apparently belong to a small subset who display an intermediate CSS/NCBRS phenotype. Our proposed genotype-phenotype correlations are important for molecular screening strategies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
27123486,"Deleterious mutation in GPR88 is associated with chorea, speech delay, and learning disabilities.","To identify the underlying molecular basis of a familial developmental disorder characterized by chorea, marked speech delay, and learning difficulties in 4 sisters from a consanguineous family.Whole-exome analysis of DNA of the 2 older patients followed by Sanger sequencing of the mutated exon in all family members.A homozygous deleterious mutation, p.C291X, was identified in the GPR88 gene in both exome analyses. The mutation segregated with the disease in the family and was absent from a large cohort of controls.Homozygous deleterious mutation in GPR88 in humans is associated with marked speech delay, learning disabilities, and chorea, which manifest at 8-9 years of age. The finding is consistent with the reported abundant expression of GPR88 in the striatum and the hyperkinetic activity and learning impairment observed in GPR88 knockout mice. Although further functional characterization is needed, the finding underscores the importance of GPR88 in movement control and learning.",research-article; journal article
24216514,A recurrent dominant negative E47 mutation causes agammaglobulinemia and BCR(-) B cells.,"Approximately 90% of patients with isolated agammaglobulinemia and failure of B cell development have mutations in genes required for signaling through the preâ€“B cell and B cell receptors. The nature of the gene defect in the majority of remaining patients is unknown. We recently identified 4 patients with agammaglobulinemia and markedly decreased numbers of peripheral B cells. The B cells that could be detected had an unusual phenotype characterized by the increased expression of CD19 but the absence of a B cell receptor. Genetic studies demonstrated that all 4 patients had the exact same de novo mutation in the broadly expressed transcription factor E47. The mutant protein (E555K) was stable in patient-derived EBV-transformed cell lines and cell lines transfected with expression vectors. E555K in the transfected cells localized normally to the nucleus and resulted in a dominant negative effect when bound to DNA as a homodimer with wild-type E47. Mutant E47 did permit DNA binding by a tissue-specific heterodimeric DNA-binding partner, myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD). These findings document a mutational hot-spot in E47 and represent an autosomal dominant form of agammaglobulinemia. Further, they indicate that E47 plays a critical role in enforcing the block in development of B cell precursors that lack functional antigen receptors.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26996949,GTF2E2 Mutations Destabilize the General Transcription Factor Complex TFIIE in Individuals with DNA Repair-Proficient Trichothiodystrophy.,"The general transcription factor IIE (TFIIE) is essential for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) via direct interaction with the basal transcription/DNA repair factor IIH (TFIIH). TFIIH harbors mutations in two rare genetic disorders, the cancer-prone xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and the cancer-free, multisystem developmental disorder trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The phenotypic complexity resulting from mutations affecting TFIIH has been attributed to the nucleotide excision repair (NER) defect as well as to impaired transcription. Here, we report two unrelated children showing clinical features typical of TTD who harbor different homozygous missense mutations in GTF2E2 (c.448G>C [p.Ala150Pro] and c.559G>T [p.Asp187Tyr]) encoding the beta subunit of transcription factor IIE (TFIIEβ). Repair of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage was normal in the GTF2E2 mutated cells, indicating that TFIIE was not involved in NER. We found decreased protein levels of the two TFIIE subunits (TFIIEα and TFIIEβ) as well as decreased phosphorylation of TFIIEα in cells from both children. Interestingly, decreased phosphorylation of TFIIEα was also seen in TTD cells with mutations in ERCC2, which encodes the XPD subunit of TFIIH, but not in XP cells with ERCC2 mutations. Our findings support the theory that TTD is caused by transcriptional impairments that are distinct from the NER disorder XP.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
25102098,A girl with West syndrome and autistic features harboring a de novo TBL1XR1 mutation.,"Recently, de novo mutations in TBL1XR1 were found in two patients with autism spectrum disorders. Here, we report on a Japanese girl presenting with West syndrome, Rett syndrome-like and autistic features. Her initial development was normal until she developed a series of spasms at 5 months of age. Electroencephalogram at 7 months showed a pattern of hypsarrhythmia, which led to a diagnosis of West syndrome. Stereotypic hand movements appeared at 8 months of age, and autistic features such as deficits in communication, hyperactivity and excitability were observed later, at 4 years and 9 months. Whole exome sequencing of the patient and her parents revealed a de novo TBL1XR1 mutation [c.209 G>A (p.Gly70Asp)] occurring at an evolutionarily conserved amino acid in an F-box-like domain. Our report expands the clinical spectrum of TBL1XR1 mutations to West syndrome with Rett-like features, together with autistic features.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
26218421,CSB-PGBD3 Mutations Cause Premature Ovarian Failure.,"Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a rare, heterogeneous disorder characterized by cessation of menstruation occurring before the age of 40 years. Genetic etiology is responsible for perhaps 25% of cases, but most cases are sporadic and unexplained. In this study, through whole exome sequencing in a non-consanguineous family having four affected members with POF and Sanger sequencing in 432 sporadic cases, we identified three novel mutations in the fusion gene CSB-PGBD3. Subsequently functional studies suggest that mutated CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein was impaired in response to DNA damage, as indicated by delayed or absent recruitment to damaged sites. Our data provide the first evidence that mutations in the CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein can cause human disease, even in the presence of functional CSB, thus potentially explaining conservation of the fusion protein for 43 My since marmoset. The localization of the CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein to UVA-induced nuclear DNA repair foci further suggests that the CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein, like many other proteins that can cause POF, modulates or participates in DNA repair.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
25062452,Exome sequencing reveals SYCE1 mutation associated with autosomal recessive primary ovarian insufficiency.,"CONTEXT: Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is caused by ovarian follicle depletion or follicle dysfunction. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from absence of pubertal maturation to early menopause. Genes involved in essential steps in chromosome synapsis and recombination during meiosis, such as synaptonemal complex central element 1 (SYCE1), have been shown to cause POI in animal models. We describe for the first time a homozygous mutation in SYCE1 in humans. OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic cause of POI in an Israeli Arab family with a consanguineous pedigree. SETTING AND DESIGN: A family-based genetic study conducted at a tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: Two daughters of consanguineous parents (first cousins) from a 13-member family were diagnosed with POI. Genotyping was performed in the index patients, their parents, and four unaffected siblings. INTERVENTION: DNA from the affected sisters was subjected to whole-exome sequencing. The genotypes of interest were confirmed and genotypes of the additional family members were determined by Sanger sequencing. Genotyping was also performed in 90 ethnically matched control individuals. RESULTS: A nonsense homozygous mutation (c.613C>T) was identified in the SYCE1 gene in both affected sisters. The parents and three brothers were heterozygous for the mutation, and an unaffected sister did not carry the mutation. The mutation was not identified in the DNA samples from the 90 control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Given the known function of the SYCE1 gene, we suggest that the nonsense mutation identified accounts for the POI phenotype. These results highlight the importance of the synaptonemal complex and meiosis in ovarian function.",journal article
26157035,A homozygous mutation of VWA3B causes cerebellar ataxia with intellectual disability.,"Hereditary cerebellar ataxia constitutes a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders, occasionally accompanied by other neurological features. Genetic defects remain to be elucidated in approximately 40% of hereditary cerebellar ataxia cases in Japan. We attempted to identify the gene responsible for autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with intellectual disability.The present study involved three patients in a consanguineous Japanese family. Neurological examination and gene analyses were performed in all family members. We performed genome-wide linkage analysis including single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, copy-number variation analysis and whole exome sequencing. To clarify the functional alteration resulting from the identified mutation, we performed cell viability assay of cultured cells expressing mutant protein.One homozygous region shared among the three patients on chromosomes 2p16.1-2q12.3 was identified. Using whole exome sequencing, six homozygous variants in genes in the region were detected. Only one variant, VWA3B c.A1865C, results in a change of a highly conserved amino acid (p.K622T) and was not present in control samples. VWA3B encodes a von Willebrand Factor A Domain-Containing Protein 3B with ubiquitous expression, including the cerebellum. The viability of cultured cells expressing the specific K622T mutation was proved to decrease through the activation of apoptotic pathway.Mutated VWA3B was found to be likely associated with cerebellar degeneration with intellectual disability. Although a rare cause of cerebellar degeneration, these findings indicate a critical role for VWA3B in the apoptosis pathway in neuronal tissues.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
24658003,TDP2 protects transcription from abortive topoisomerase activity and is required for normal neural function.,"Topoisomerase II (TOP2) removes torsional stress from DNA and facilitates gene transcription by introducing transient DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Such DSBs are normally rejoined by TOP2 but on occasion can become abortive and remain unsealed. Here we identify homozygous mutations in the TDP2 gene encoding tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-2, an enzyme that repairs 'abortive' TOP2-induced DSBs, in individuals with intellectual disability, seizures and ataxia. We show that cells from affected individuals are hypersensitive to TOP2-induced DSBs and that loss of TDP2 inhibits TOP2-dependent gene transcription in cultured human cells and in mouse post-mitotic neurons following abortive TOP2 activity. Notably, TDP2 is also required for normal levels of many gene transcripts in developing mouse brain, including numerous gene transcripts associated with neurological function and/or disease, and for normal interneuron density in mouse cerebellum. Collectively, these data implicate chromosome breakage by TOP2 as an endogenous threat to gene transcription and to normal neuronal development and maintenance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25899990,Deleterious mutation in SYCE1 is associated with non-obstructive azoospermia.,"To determine the molecular basis of familial, autosomal-recessive, non-obstructive azoospermia in a consanguineous Iranian Jewish family.We investigated the genetic cause of non-obstructive azoospermia in two affected siblings from a consanguineous family. Homozygosity mapping in the DNA samples of the patients and their normospermic brother was followed by exome analysis of one of the patients. Other family members were genotyped for the mutation by Sanger sequencing. The mutation effect was demonstrated by immunostaining of the patients' testicular tissue.The two patients were homozygous for a splice site mutation in SYCE1 which resulted in retention of intron three in the cDNA and premature stop codon. SYCE1 encodes a Synaptonemal Complex protein which plays an essential role during meiosis. Immunostaining of patient's testicular tissue with anti-Syce1 antibody revealed an undetectable level of Syce1. Histological examination of the patients' tissue disclosed immature-stages spermatocytes without mature forms, indicating maturation arrest.The significance of most synaptonemal complex proteins was previously demonstrated in a mutant mouse model. The present report underscores the importance of synaptonemal complex proteins in spermatogenenesis in humans. Our new approach, combining homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, resulted in one of the first reports of an autosomal-recessive form of NOA.",research-article; journal article; case reports
26494905,Hypomorphic mutations in TRNT1 cause retinitis pigmentosa with erythrocytic microcytosis.,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a highly heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by degeneration of the retinal photoreceptor cells and progressive loss of vision. While hundreds of mutations in more than 100 genes have been reported to cause RP, discovering the causative mutations in many patients remains a significant challenge. Exome sequencing in an individual affected with non-syndromic RP revealed two plausibly disease-causing variants in TRNT1, a gene encoding a nucleotidyltransferase critical for tRNA processing. A total of 727 additional unrelated individuals with molecularly uncharacterized RP were completely screened for TRNT1 coding sequence variants, and a second family was identified with two members who exhibited a phenotype that was remarkably similar to the index patient. Inactivating mutations in TRNT1 have been previously shown to cause a severe congenital syndrome of sideroblastic anemia, B-cell immunodeficiency, recurrent fevers and developmental delay (SIFD). Complete blood counts of all three of our patients revealed red blood cell microcytosis and anisocytosis with only mild anemia. Characterization of TRNT1 in patient-derived cell lines revealed reduced but detectable TRNT1 protein, consistent with partial function. Suppression of trnt1 expression in zebrafish recapitulated several features of the human SIFD syndrome, including anemia and sensory organ defects. When levels of trnt1 were titrated, visual dysfunction was found in the absence of other phenotypes. The visual defects in the trnt1-knockdown zebrafish were ameliorated by the addition of exogenous human TRNT1 RNA. Our findings indicate that hypomorphic TRNT1 mutations can cause a recessive disease that is almost entirely limited to the retina.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26047794,Autosomal-Recessive Mutations in SLC34A1 Encoding Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter 2A Cause Idiopathic Infantile Hypercalcemia.,"Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH) is characterized by severe hypercalcemia with failure to thrive, vomiting, dehydration, and nephrocalcinosis. Recently, mutations in the vitamin D catabolizing enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) were described that lead to increased sensitivity to vitamin D due to accumulation of the active metabolite 1,25-(OH)2D3. In a subgroup of patients who presented in early infancy with renal phosphate wasting and symptomatic hypercalcemia, mutations in CYP24A1 were excluded. Four patients from families with parental consanguinity were subjected to homozygosity mapping that identified a second IIH gene locus on chromosome 5q35 with a maximum logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 6.79. The sequence analysis of the most promising candidate gene, SLC34A1 encoding renal sodium-phosphate cotransporter 2A (NaPi-IIa), revealed autosomal-recessive mutations in the four index cases and in 12 patients with sporadic IIH. Functional studies of mutant NaPi-IIa in Xenopus oocytes and opossum kidney (OK) cells demonstrated disturbed trafficking to the plasma membrane and loss of phosphate transport activity. Analysis of calcium and phosphate metabolism in Slc34a1-knockout mice highlighted the effect of phosphate depletion and fibroblast growth factor-23 suppression on the development of the IIH phenotype. The human and mice data together demonstrate that primary renal phosphate wasting caused by defective NaPi-IIa function induces inappropriate production of 1,25-(OH)2D3 with subsequent symptomatic hypercalcemia. Clinical and laboratory findings persist despite cessation of vitamin D prophylaxis but rapidly respond to phosphate supplementation. Therefore, early differentiation between SLC34A1 (NaPi-IIa) and CYP24A1 (24-hydroxylase) defects appears critical for targeted therapy in patients with IIH.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26196677,Whole Exome Sequencing Identified MCM2 as a Novel Causative Gene for Autosomal Dominant Nonsyndromic Deafness in a Chinese Family.,"We report the genetic analysis of autosomal dominant, nonsyndromic, progressive sensorineural hearing loss in a Chinese family. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a missense variant (c.130C>T, p.R44C) in the MCM2 gene, which has a pro-apoptosis effect and is involved in the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. This missense variant is very likely to be the disease causing variant. It segregated with hearing loss in this pedigree, and was not found in the dbSNP database or databases of genomes and SNP in the Chinese population, in 76 patients with sporadic hearing loss, or in 145 normal individuals. We performed western blot and immunofluorescence to test the MCM2 protein expression in the cochlea of rats and guinea pigs, demonstrating that MCM2 was widely expressed in the cochlea and was also surprisingly expressed in the cytoplasm of terminally differentiated hair cells. We then transiently expressed the variant MCM2 cDNA in HEK293 cells, and found that these cells displayed a slight increase in apoptosis without any changes in proliferation or cell cycle, supporting the view that this variant is pathogenic. In summary, we have identified MCM2 as a novel gene responsible for nonsyndromic hearing loss of autosomal dominant inheritance in a Chinese family.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
26197441,A Novel Locus Harbouring a Functional CD164 Nonsense Mutation Identified in a Large Danish Family with Nonsyndromic Hearing Impairment.,"Nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) is a highly heterogeneous condition with more than eighty known causative genes. However, in the clinical setting, a large number of NSHI families have unexplained etiology, suggesting that there are many more genes to be identified. In this study we used SNP-based linkage analysis and follow up microsatellite markers to identify a novel locus (DFNA66) on chromosome 6q15-21 (LOD 5.1) in a large Danish family with dominantly inherited NSHI. By locus specific capture and next-generation sequencing, we identified a c.574C>T heterozygous nonsense mutation (p.R192*) in CD164. This gene encodes a 197 amino acid transmembrane sialomucin (known as endolyn, MUC-24 or CD164), which is widely expressed and involved in cell adhesion and migration. The mutation segregated with the phenotype and was absent in 1200 Danish control individuals and in databases with whole-genome and exome sequence data. The predicted effect of the mutation was a truncation of the last six C-terminal residues of the cytoplasmic tail of CD164, including a highly conserved canonical sorting motif (YXXФ). In whole blood from an affected individual, we found by RT-PCR both the wild-type and the mutated transcript suggesting that the mutant transcript escapes nonsense mediated decay. Functional studies in HEK cells demonstrated that the truncated protein was almost completely retained on the plasma cell membrane in contrast to the wild-type protein, which targeted primarily to the endo-lysosomal compartments, implicating failed endocytosis as a possible disease mechanism. In the mouse ear, we found CD164 expressed in the inner and outer hair cells of the organ of Corti, as well as in other locations in the cochlear duct. In conclusion, we have identified a new DFNA locus located on chromosome 6q15-21 and implicated CD164 as a novel gene for hearing impairment.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27087320,De Novo Mutations of RERE Cause a Genetic Syndrome with Features that Overlap Those Associated with Proximal 1p36 Deletions.,"Deletions of chromosome 1p36 affect approximately 1 in 5,000 newborns and are associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and defects involving the brain, eye, ear, heart, and kidney. Arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide repeats (RERE) is located in the proximal 1p36 critical region. RERE is a widely-expressed nuclear receptor coregulator that positively regulates retinoic acid signaling. Animal models suggest that RERE deficiency might contribute to many of the structural and developmental birth defects and medical problems seen in individuals with 1p36 deletion syndrome, although human evidence supporting this role has been lacking. In this report, we describe ten individuals with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and/or autism spectrum disorder who carry rare and putatively damaging changes in RERE. In all cases in which both parental DNA samples were available, these changes were found to be de novo. Associated features that were recurrently seen in these individuals included hypotonia, seizures, behavioral problems, structural CNS anomalies, ophthalmologic anomalies, congenital heart defects, and genitourinary abnormalities. The spectrum of defects documented in these individuals is similar to that of a cohort of 31 individuals with isolated 1p36 deletions that include RERE and are recapitulated in RERE-deficient zebrafish and mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that mutations in RERE cause a genetic syndrome and that haploinsufficiency of RERE might be sufficient to cause many of the phenotypes associated with proximal 1p36 deletions.",brief-report; journal article; case reports
27153399,Somatic Mutations in NEK9 Cause Nevus Comedonicus.,"Acne vulgaris (AV) affects most adolescents, and of those affected, moderate to severe disease occurs in 20%. Comedones, follicular plugs consisting of desquamated keratinocytes and sebum, are central to its pathogenesis. Despite high heritability in first-degree relatives, AV genetic determinants remain incompletely understood. We therefore employed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in nevus comedonicus (NC), a rare disorder that features comedones and inflammatory acne cysts in localized, linear configurations. WES identified somatic NEK9 mutations, each affecting highly conserved residues within its kinase or RCC1 domains, in affected tissue of three out of three NC-affected subjects. All mutations are gain of function, resulting in increased phosphorylation at Thr210, a hallmark of NEK9 kinase activation. We found that comedo formation in NC is marked by loss of follicular differentiation markers, expansion of keratin-15-positive cells from localization within the bulge to the entire sub-bulge follicle and cyst, and ectopic expression of keratin 10, a marker of interfollicular differentiation not present in normal follicles. These findings suggest that NEK9 mutations in NC disrupt normal follicular differentiation and identify NEK9 as a potential regulator of follicular homeostasis.",brief-report; journal article; case reports
26951679,Whole-exome sequencing identifies MST1R as a genetic susceptibility gene in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"Multiple factors, including host genetics, environmental factors, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, contribute to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) development. To identify genetic susceptibility genes for NPC, a whole-exome sequencing (WES) study was performed in 161 NPC cases and 895 controls of Southern Chinese descent. The gene-based burden test discovered an association between macrophage-stimulating 1 receptor (MST1R) and NPC. We identified 13 independent cases carrying the MST1R pathogenic heterozygous germ-line variants, and 53.8% of these cases were diagnosed with NPC aged at or even younger than 20 y, indicating that MST1R germline variants are relevant to disease early-age onset (EAO) (age of ≤20 y). In total, five MST1R missense variants were found in EAO cases but were rare in controls (EAO vs. control, 17.9% vs. 1.2%, P = 7.94 × 10(-12)). The validation study, including 2,160 cases and 2,433 controls, showed that the MST1R variant c.G917A:p.R306H is highly associated with NPC (odds ratio of 9.0). MST1R is predominantly expressed in the tissue-resident macrophages and is critical for innate immunity that protects organs from tissue damage and inflammation. Importantly, MST1R expression is detected in the ciliated epithelial cells in normal nasopharyngeal mucosa and plays a role in the cilia motility important for host defense. Although no somatic mutation of MST1R was identified in the sporadic NPC tumors, copy number alterations and promoter hypermethylation at MST1R were often observed. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of NPC by highlighting the involvement of the MST1R-mediated signaling pathways.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

27173016,Involvement of GATOR complex genes in familial focal epilepsies and focal cortical dysplasia.,"The discovery of mutations in DEPDC5 in familial focal epilepsies has introduced a novel pathomechanism to a field so far dominated by ion channelopathies. DEPDC5 is part of a complex named GAP activity toward RAGs (GATOR) complex 1 (GATOR1), together with the proteins NPRL2 and NPRL3, and acts to inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. GATOR1 is in turn inhibited by the GATOR2 complex. The mTORC1 pathway is a major signaling cascade regulating cell growth, proliferation, and migration. We aimed to study the contribution of GATOR complex genes to the etiology of focal epilepsies and to describe the associated phenotypical spectrum.We performed targeted sequencing of the genes encoding the components of the GATOR1 (DEPDC5, NPRL2, and NPRL3) and GATOR2 (MIOS, SEC13, SEH1L, WDR24, and WDR59) complex in 93 European probands with focal epilepsy with or without focal cortical dysplasia. Phospho-S6 immunoreactivity was used as evidence of mTORC1 pathway activation in resected brain tissue of patients carrying pathogenic variants.We identified four pathogenic variants in DEPDC5, two in NPRL2, and one in NPRL3. We showed hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway in brain tissue from patients with NPRL2 and NPRL3 mutations. Collectively, inactivating mutations in GATOR1 complex genes explained 11% of cases of focal epilepsy, whereas no pathogenic mutations were found in GATOR2 complex genes. GATOR1-related focal epilepsies differ clinically from focal epilepsies due to mutations in ion channel genes by their association with focal cortical dysplasia and seizures emerging from variable foci, and might confer an increased risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP).GATOR1 complex gene mutations leading to mTORC1 pathway upregulation is an important cause of focal epilepsy with cortical malformations and represents a potential target for novel therapeutic approaches.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
26285051,Familial cortical dysplasia caused by mutation in the mammalian target of rapamycin regulator NPRL3.,"We describe first cousin sibling pairs with focal epilepsy, one of each pair having focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) IIa. Linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous germline frameshift mutation in the gene encoding nitrogen permease regulator-like 3 (NPRL3). NPRL3 is a component of GAP Activity Towards Rags 1, a negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling pathway. Immunostaining of resected brain tissue demonstrated mammalian target of rapamycin activation. Screening of 52 unrelated individuals with FCD identified 2 additional patients with FCDIIa and germline NPRL3 mutations. Similar to DEPDC5, NPRL3 mutations may be considered as causal variants in patients with FCD or magnetic resonance imaging-negative focal epilepsy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27843126,"Biallelic Loss of Proprioception-Related PIEZO2 Causes Muscular Atrophy with Perinatal Respiratory Distress, Arthrogryposis, and Scoliosis.","We report ten individuals of four independent consanguineous families from Turkey, India, Libya, and Pakistan with a variable clinical phenotype that comprises arthrogryposis, spontaneously resolving respiratory insufficiency at birth, muscular atrophy predominantly of the distal lower limbs, scoliosis, and mild distal sensory involvement. Using whole-exome sequencing, SNPchip-based linkage analysis, DNA microarray, and Sanger sequencing, we identified three independent homozygous frameshift mutations and a homozygous deletion of two exons in PIEZO2 that segregated in all affected individuals of the respective family. The mutations are localized in the N-terminal and central region of the gene, leading to nonsense-mediated transcript decay and consequently to lack of PIEZO2 protein. In contrast, heterozygous gain-of-function missense mutations, mainly localized at the C terminus, cause dominant distal arthrogryposis 3 (DA3), distal arthrogryposis 5 (DA5), or Marden-Walker syndrome (MWKS), which encompass contractures of hands and feet, scoliosis, ophthalmoplegia, and ptosis. PIEZO2 encodes a mechanosensitive ion channel that plays a major role in light-touch mechanosensation and has recently been identified as the principal mechanotransduction channel for proprioception. Mice ubiquitously depleted of PIEZO2 are postnatally lethal. However, individuals lacking PIEZO2 develop a not life-threatening, slowly progressive disorder, which is likely due to loss of PIEZO2 protein in afferent neurons leading to disturbed proprioception causing aberrant muscle development and function. Here we report a recessively inherited PIEZO2-related disease and demonstrate that depending on the type of mutation and the mode of inheritance, PIEZO2 causes clinically distinguishable phenotypes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26208961,SQSTM1 splice site mutation in distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles.,"To identify the genetic etiology and characterize the clinicopathologic features of a novel distal myopathy.We performed whole-exome sequencing on a family with an autosomal dominant distal myopathy and targeted exome sequencing in 1 patient with sporadic distal myopathy, both with rimmed vacuolar pathology. We also evaluated the pathogenicity of identified mutations using immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and expression studies.Sequencing identified a likely pathogenic c.1165+1 G>A splice donor variant in SQSTM1 in the affected members of 1 family and in an unrelated patient with sporadic distal myopathy. Affected patients had late-onset distal lower extremity weakness, myopathic features on EMG, and muscle pathology demonstrating rimmed vacuoles with both TAR DNA-binding protein 43 and SQSTM1 inclusions. The c.1165+1 G>A SQSTM1 variant results in the expression of 2 alternatively spliced SQSTM1 proteins: 1 lacking the C-terminal PEST2 domain and another lacking the C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, both of which have distinct patterns of cellular and skeletal muscle localization.SQSTM1 is an autophagic adaptor that shuttles aggregated and ubiquitinated proteins to the autophagosome for degradation via its C-terminal UBA domain. Similar to mutations in VCP, dominantly inherited mutations in SQSTM1 are now associated with rimmed vacuolar myopathy, Paget disease of bone, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia. Our data further suggest a pathogenic connection between the disparate phenotypes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27479907,Distinct genetic architectures for syndromic and nonsyndromic congenital heart defects identified by exome sequencing.,"Congenital heart defects (CHDs) have a neonatal incidence of 0.8-1% (refs. 1,2). Despite abundant examples of monogenic CHD in humans and mice, CHD has a low absolute sibling recurrence risk (∼2.7%), suggesting a considerable role for de novo mutations (DNMs) and/or incomplete penetrance. De novo protein-truncating variants (PTVs) have been shown to be enriched among the 10% of 'syndromic' patients with extra-cardiac manifestations. We exome sequenced 1,891 probands, including both syndromic CHD (S-CHD, n = 610) and nonsyndromic CHD (NS-CHD, n = 1,281). In S-CHD, we confirmed a significant enrichment of de novo PTVs but not inherited PTVs in known CHD-associated genes, consistent with recent findings. Conversely, in NS-CHD we observed significant enrichment of PTVs inherited from unaffected parents in CHD-associated genes. We identified three genome-wide significant S-CHD disorders caused by DNMs in CHD4, CDK13 and PRKD1. Our study finds evidence for distinct genetic architectures underlying the low sibling recurrence risk in S-CHD and NS-CHD.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27738187,"Chitayat syndrome: hyperphalangism, characteristic facies, hallux valgus and bronchomalacia results from a recurrent c.266A>G p.(Tyr89Cys) variant in the ERF gene.","In 1993, Chitayat et al., reported a newborn with hyperphalangism, facial anomalies, and bronchomalacia. We identified three additional families with similar findings. Features include bilateral accessory phalanx resulting in shortened index fingers; hallux valgus; distinctive face; respiratory compromise.To identify the genetic aetiology of Chitayat syndrome and identify a unifying cause for this specific form of hyperphalangism.Through ongoing collaboration, we had collected patients with strikingly-similar phenotype. Trio-based exome sequencing was first performed in Patient 2 through Deciphering Developmental Disorders study. Proband-only exome sequencing had previously been independently performed in Patient 4. Following identification of a candidate gene variant in Patient 2, the same variant was subsequently confirmed from exome data in Patient 4. Sanger sequencing was used to validate this variant in Patients 1, 3; confirm paternal inheritance in Patient 5.A recurrent, novel variant NM_006494.2:c.266A>G p.(Tyr89Cys) in ERF was identified in five affected individuals: de novo (patient 1, 2 and 3) and inherited from an affected father (patient 4 and 5). p.Tyr89Cys is an aromatic polar neutral to polar neutral amino acid substitution, at a highly conserved position and lies within the functionally important ETS-domain of the protein. The recurrent ERF c.266A>C p.(Tyr89Cys) variant causes Chitayat syndrome.ERF variants have previously been associated with complex craniosynostosis. In contrast, none of the patients with the c.266A>G p.(Tyr89Cys) variant have craniosynostosis.We report the molecular aetiology of Chitayat syndrome and discuss potential mechanisms for this distinctive phenotype associated with the p.Tyr89Cys substitution in ERF.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25647543,First two unrelated cases of isolated sedoheptulokinase deficiency: A benign disorder?,"We present the first two reported unrelated patients with an isolated sedoheptulokinase (SHPK) deficiency. The first patient presented with neonatal cholestasis, hypoglycemia, and anemia, while the second patient presented with congenital arthrogryposis multiplex, multiple contractures, and dysmorphisms. Both patients had elevated excretion of erythritol and sedoheptulose, and each had a homozygous nonsense mutation in SHPK. SHPK is an enzyme that phosphorylates sedoheptulose to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, which is an important intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway. It is questionable whether SHPK deficiency is a causal factor for the clinical phenotypes of our patients. This study illustrates the necessity of extensive functional and clinical workup for interpreting a novel variant, including nonsense variants.",research-article; journal article; case reports
27545678,Mutations in PADI6 Cause Female Infertility Characterized by Early Embryonic Arrest.,"Early embryonic arrest is one of the major causes of female infertility. However, because of difficulties in phenotypic evaluation, genetic determinants of human early embryonic arrest are largely unknown. With the development of assisted reproductive technology, the phenotype of early human embryonic arrest can now be carefully evaluated. Here, we describe a consanguineous family with a recessive inheritance pattern of female infertility characterized by recurrent early embryonic arrest in cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We have identified a homozygous PADI6 nonsense mutation (c.1141C>T [p.Gln381(∗)]) that is responsible for the phenotype. Mutational analysis of PADI6 in a cohort of 36 individuals whose embryos displayed developmental arrest identified two affected individuals with compound-heterozygous mutations (c.2009_2010del [p.Glu670Glyfs(∗)48] and c.633T>A [p.His211Gln]; c.1618G>A [p.Gly540Arg] and c.970C>T [p.Gln324(∗)]). Immunostaining indicated a lack of PADI6 in affected individuals' oocytes. In addition, the amount of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II and expression levels of seven genes involved in zygotic genome activation were reduced in the affected individuals' embryos. This phenotype is consistent with Padi6 knockout mice. These findings deepen our understanding of the genetic basis of human early embryonic arrest, which has been a largely ignored Mendelian phenotype. Our findings lay the foundation for uncovering other genetic causes of infertility resulting from early embryonic arrest.",brief-report; journal article
27389779,De novo missense variants in HECW2 are associated with neurodevelopmental delay and hypotonia.,"BACKGROUND:The causes of intellectual disability (ID) are diverse and de novo mutations are increasingly recognised to account for a significant proportion of ID. METHODS AND RESULTS:In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing on a large cohort of patients with ID or neurodevelopmental delay and identified four novel de novo predicted deleterious missense variants in HECW2 in six probands with ID/developmental delay and hypotonia. Other common features include seizures, strabismus, nystagmus, cortical visual impairment and dysmorphic facial features. HECW2 is an ubiquitin ligase that stabilises p73, a crucial mediator of neurodevelopment and neurogenesis.

25847581,ELP2 is a novel gene implicated in neurodevelopmental disabilities.,"Elongator is a multi-subunit protein complex essential to transcription elongation, histone acetylation, and tRNA modification. The complex consists of six highly conserved protein subunits, called Elongator Proteins (ELP) 1-6. Apart from an association with intellectual disability (ID), there is limited clinical information about patients with ELP2 variants. Here we report on two brothers with severe ID, spastic diplegia, and self-injury whose presentation eluded a diagnosis for over 20 years. In both brothers, whole exome sequencing revealed a likely pathogenic, compound heterozygous missense variant in ELP2. We describe the phenotype and natural history of the ELP2-related disorder in these brothers.",journal article; case reports
27843125,"Recessive Mutations in ACPT, Encoding Testicular Acid Phosphatase, Cause Hypoplastic Amelogenesis Imperfecta.","Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders affecting tooth enamel. The affected enamel can be hypoplastic and/or hypomineralized. In this study, we identified ACPT (testicular acid phosphatase) biallelic mutations causing non-syndromic, generalized hypoplastic autosomal-recessive amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) in individuals from six apparently unrelated Turkish families. Families 1, 4, and 5 were affected by the homozygous ACPT mutation c.713C>T (p.Ser238Leu), family 2 by the homozygous ACPT mutation c.331C>T (p.Arg111Cys), family 3 by the homozygous ACPT mutation c.226C>T (p.Arg76Cys), and family 6 by the compound heterozygous ACPT mutations c.382G>C (p.Ala128Pro) and 397G>A (p.Glu133Lys). Analysis of the ACPT crystal structure suggests that these mutations damaged the activity of ACPT by altering the sizes and charges of key amino acid side chains, limiting accessibility of the catalytic core, and interfering with homodimerization. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed localization of ACPT in secretory-stage ameloblasts. The study results provide evidence for the crucial function of ACPT during amelogenesis.",brief-report; journal article; case reports
27773429,Loss of Glycine Transporter 1 Causes a Subtype of Glycine Encephalopathy with Arthrogryposis and Mildly Elevated Cerebrospinal Fluid Glycine.,"Glycine is a major neurotransmitter that activates inhibitory glycine receptors and is a co-agonist for excitatory glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Two transporters, GLYT1 and GLYT2, regulate extracellular glycine concentrations within the CNS. Dysregulation of the extracellular glycine has been associated with hyperekplexia and nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Here, we report four individuals from two families who presented at birth with facial dysmorphism, encephalopathy, arthrogryposis, hypotonia progressing to hypertonicity with startle-like clonus, and respiratory failure. Only one individual survived the respiratory failure and was weaned off ventilation but has significant global developmental delay. Mildly elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glycine and normal serum glycine were observed in two individuals. In both families, we identified truncating mutations in SLC6A9, encoding GLYT1. We demonstrate that pharmacologic or genetic abolishment of GlyT1 activity in mice leads to mildly elevated glycine in the CSF but not in blood. Additionally, previously reported slc6a9-null mice and zebrafish mutants also display phenotypes consistent with the affected individuals we examined. Our data suggest that truncating SLC6A9 mutations lead to a distinct human neurological syndrome hallmarked by mildly elevated CSF glycine and normal serum glycine.",brief-report; journal article
27839872,Mutations in CPAMD8 Cause a Unique Form of Autosomal-Recessive Anterior Segment Dysgenesis.,"Anterior segment dysgeneses (ASDs) comprise a spectrum of developmental disorders affecting the anterior segment of the eye. Here, we describe three unrelated families affected by a previously unclassified form of ASD. Shared ocular manifestations include bilateral iris hypoplasia, ectopia lentis, corectopia, ectropion uveae, and cataracts. Whole-exome sequencing and targeted Sanger sequencing identified mutations in CPAMD8 (C3 and PZP-like alpha-2-macroglobulin domain-containing protein 8) as the cause of recessive ASD in all three families. A homozygous missense mutation in the evolutionarily conserved alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) domain of CPAMD8, c.4351T>C (p. Ser1451Pro), was identified in family 1. In family 2, compound heterozygous frameshift, c.2352_2353insC (p.Arg785Glnfs∗23), and splice-site, c.4549-1G>A, mutations were identified. Two affected siblings in the third family were compound heterozygous for splice-site mutations c.700+1G>T and c.4002+1G>A. CPAMD8 splice-site mutations caused aberrant pre-mRNA splicing in vivo or in vitro. Intriguingly, our phylogenetic analysis revealed rodent lineage-specific CPAMD8 deletion, precluding a developmental expression study in mice. We therefore investigated the spatiotemporal expression of CPAMD8 in the developing human eye. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization revealed CPAMD8 expression in the lens, iris, cornea, and retina early in development, including strong expression in the distal tips of the retinal neuroepithelium that form the iris and ciliary body, thus correlating CPAMD8 expression with the affected tissues. Our study delineates a unique form of recessive ASD and defines a role for CPAMD8, a protein of unknown function, in anterior segment development, implying another pathway for the pathogenicity of ASD.",brief-report; journal article
27984003,A Systematic Analysis of Treatment and Outcomes of NOD2-Associated Autoinflammatory Disease.,"Yao syndrome, formerly named NOD2-associated autoinflammatory disease, is a periodic disease characterized by fever, dermatitis, polyarthritis/leg swelling, and gastrointestinal and sicca-like symptoms associated with specific NOD2 sequence variants. Our aim was to evaluate the treatment and outcomes of the disease.A total of 52 adult patients with autoinflammatory disease phenotype were diagnosed with Yao syndrome and enrolled at the Cleveland Clinic between November 2009 and May 2015. All patients were genotyped for the NOD2 variants, and systematically studied for treatment outcomes.Among the 52 Yao syndrome patients, all were white, and 72% were women. The mean age at diagnosis was 38.0 ± 12.0 years, and the disease duration was 8.8 ± 5.8 years. In the multi-organ disease, more common and typical manifestations were recurrent dermatitis and inflammatory arthritis with or without distal leg swelling besides recurrent fever. It was genotypically associated with the NOD2 IVS8+158 or R702W. Therapeutically, glucocorticoids markedly decreased the disease severity and duration of flares in 19 patients (36.6%), sulfasalazine treatment achieved a significant symptomatic improvement in 22 (42%) patients, and 3 patients received canakinumab or tocilizumab with benefits. Prognostically, 13% of the 52 patients had somewhat physical impairment, and there was no mortality during the follow-up. Associated comorbidities were fibromyalgia, asthma, renal stones, and ventricular hypertrophy.As a systemic disease, Yao syndrome uncommonly affects the solid internal organs, but it can be complicated with chronic pain syndrome and even disability. Glucocorticoids or sulfasalazine may be considered as the first-line treatment option, and interleukin (IL)-1/IL-6 inhibitors may be tried for refractory cases. The potential associations between certain comorbidities and Yao syndrome deserve further study.",journal article
26070941,NOD2-associated autoinflammatory disease: a large cohort study.,"The aims of the study were to characterize the genotype profile of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2)-associated autoinflammatory disease (NAID) and to report an extended study of the disease.A total of 143 adult patients presented with clinical phenotypes suspicious for NAID and all were genotyped for NOD2 sequence variants. The genotype frequencies were compared between our cohort and literature reports. These patients were divided into two groups predicated on the presence or absence of NOD2 variants.Of the 143 patients, 67 (47%) carry NOD2 variants; the genotype frequency was significantly higher among our cohort than in the historical healthy controls. Fifty-four of the 67 carriers of NOD2 variants had NAID, which has a genotype profile that is somewhat different from Crohn's disease. All NAID patients were non-Jewish whites and 69% were women. The median age at onset was 33.5 years and the median disease duration at diagnosis was 10.7 years. NAID was sporadic in 93% of cases. Patients typically presented with periodic fever, dermatitis and inflammatory arthritis. As compared with the NOD2 variant-negative patients, the skin disease more typically manifested as erythematous patches or plaques on the trunk. Oligopolyarthritis/-arthralgia was common, with characteristic distal lower extremity swelling. Associated NOD2 variants were primarily IVS8(+158) or compound IVS8(+158) and R702W.This study underscores the NOD2 genotype association with NAID, which is a genetically complex multisystem disorder. It differs phenotypically from Crohn's disease with a distinct genotype profile. This disease may be more common than initially thought.",comparative study; journal article
26248010,Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 20: a novel imprinting disorder of growth failure.,"Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 20 (UPD(20)mat) has been reported in only four patients, three of whom also had mosaicism for complete or partial trisomy of chromosome 20. We sought to evaluate the clinical significance of isolated UPD(20)mat in eight individuals.We evaluated phenotypic and genomic findings of a series of eight new patients with UPD(20)mat.All eight individuals with UPD(20)mat had intrauterine growth restriction, short stature, and prominent feeding difficulties with failure to thrive. As a common feature, they often required gastric tube feeds. Genomic data in most patients are indicative of UPD as a result of trisomy rescue after meiosis II nondisjunction.We describe the first natural history of the disorder and the results of therapeutic interventions, including the frequent requirement of direct gastric feedings only during the first few years of life, and propose that growth hormone supplementation is probably safe and effective for this condition. We suggest that UPD(20)mat can be regarded as a new imprinting disorder and its identification requires specialized molecular testing, which should be performed in patients with early-onset idiopathic isolated growth failure.Genet Med 18 4, 309-315.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
27330106,Gain-of-function mutation in TRPV4 identified in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head.,"BACKGROUND:Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a debilitating disease that involves impaired blood supply to the femoral head and leads to femoral head collapse. METHODS:We use whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing to analyse a family with inherited osteonecrosis of the femoral head and fluorescent Ca(2+) imaging to functionally characterise the variant protein. RESULTS:We report a family with four siblings affected with inherited osteonecrosis of the femoral head and the identification of a c.2480_2483delCCCG frameshift deletion followed by a c.2486T>A substitution in one allele of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) gene. TRPV4 encodes a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel known to play a role in vasoregulation and osteoclast differentiation. While pathogenic TRPV4 mutations affect the skeletal or nervous systems, association with osteonecrosis of the femoral head is novel. Functional measurements of Ca(2+) influx through mutant TRPV4 channels in HEK293 cells and patient-derived dermal fibroblasts identified a TRPV4 gain of function. Analysis of channel open times, determined indirectly from measurement of TRPV4 activity within a cluster of TRPV4 channels, revealed that the TRPV4 gain of function was caused by longer channel openings. CONCLUSIONS:These findings identify a novel TRPV4 mutation implicating TRPV4 and altered calcium homeostasis in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis while reinforcing the importance of TRPV4 in bone diseases and vascular endothelium.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
28132689,"Biallelic Mutations in DNAJC12 Cause Hyperphenylalaninemia, Dystonia, and Intellectual Disability.","Phenylketonuria (PKU, phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency), an inborn error of metabolism, can be detected through newborn screening for hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Most individuals with HPA harbor mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), and a small proportion (2%) exhibit tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency with additional neurotransmitter (dopamine and serotonin) deficiency. Here we report six individuals from four unrelated families with HPA who exhibited progressive neurodevelopmental delay, dystonia, and a unique profile of neurotransmitter deficiencies without mutations in PAH or BH4 metabolism disorder-related genes. In these six affected individuals, whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified biallelic mutations in DNAJC12, which encodes a heat shock co-chaperone family member that interacts with phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylases catalyzing the BH4-activated conversion of phenylalanine into tyrosine, tyrosine into L-dopa (the precursor of dopamine), and tryptophan into 5-hydroxytryptophan (the precursor of serotonin), respectively. DNAJC12 was undetectable in fibroblasts from the individuals with null mutations. PAH enzyme activity was reduced in the presence of DNAJC12 mutations. Early treatment with BH4 and/or neurotransmitter precursors had dramatic beneficial effects and resulted in the prevention of neurodevelopmental delay in the one individual treated before symptom onset. Thus, DNAJC12 deficiency is a preventable and treatable cause of intellectual disability that should be considered in the early differential diagnosis when screening results are positive for HPA. Sequencing of DNAJC12 may resolve any uncertainty and should be considered in all children with unresolved HPA.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27008867,Mutations in C8ORF37 cause Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS21).,"Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a multisystem genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy that most commonly leads to obesity, photoreceptor degeneration, digit anomalies, genito-urinary abnormalities, as well as cognitive impairment with autism, among other features. Sequencing of a DNA sample from a 17-year-old female affected with BBS did not identify any mutation in the known BBS genes. Whole-genome sequencing identified a novel loss-of-function disease-causing homozygous mutation (K102*) in C8ORF37, a gene coding for a cilia protein. The proband was overweight (body mass index 29.1) with a slowly progressive rod-cone dystrophy, a mild learning difficulty, high myopia, three limb post-axial polydactyly, horseshoe kidney, abnormally positioned uterus and elevated liver enzymes. Mutations in C8ORF37 were previously associated with severe autosomal recessive retinal dystrophies (retinitis pigmentosa RP64 and cone-rod dystrophy CORD16) but not BBS. To elucidate the functional role of C8ORF37 in a vertebrate system, we performed gene knockdown in Danio rerio and assessed the cardinal features of BBS and visual function. Knockdown of c8orf37 resulted in impaired visual behavior and BBS-related phenotypes, specifically, defects in the formation of Kupffer's vesicle and delays in retrograde transport. Specificity of these phenotypes to BBS knockdown was shown with rescue experiments. Over-expression of human missense mutations in zebrafish also resulted in impaired visual behavior and BBS-related phenotypes. This is the first functional validation and association of C8ORF37 mutations with the BBS phenotype, which identifies BBS21. The zebrafish studies hereby show that C8ORF37 variants underlie clinically diagnosed BBS-related phenotypes as well as isolated retinal degeneration.",research-article; journal article
26854863,C8orf37 is mutated in Bardet-Biedl syndrome and constitutes a locus allelic to non-syndromic retinal dystrophies.,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a pleiotropic and clinically and genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy. Primary features are early-onset retinal dystrophy that is typically rod-cone, obesity, polydactyly, renal abnormalities, hypogonadism, and learning difficulties, but most patients do not present with the full clinical picture. In a BBS patient from a consanguineous marriage we performed next-generation sequencing targeting all known BBS genes and other genes known or hypothesized to cause ciliopathies. While no mutation was present in any of the recognized genes for BBS, we were able to identify the homozygous non-conservative mutation c.529C>T (p.Arg177Trp) in C8orf37 that segregated with the phenotype, affects an evolutionarily highly conserved residue, and is bioinformatically predicted to be pathogenic. The same mutation has been described in unrelated patients with non-syndromic cone-rod dystrophy and other C8orf37 changes were found in individuals with retinitis pigmentosa. We conclude that C8orf37 should be added to BBS screening panels as a probable rare cause of the disease and that individuals with C8orf37-related retinal dystrophy should be screened for BBS features.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
25424902,Loss of function mutations in RPL27 and RPS27 identified by whole-exome sequencing in Diamond-Blackfan anaemia.,"Diamond-Blackfan anaemia is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome that is characterized by red blood cell aplasia. The disease has been associated with mutations or large deletions in 11 ribosomal protein genes including RPS7, RPS10, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, RPS26, RPS29, RPL5, RPL11, RPL26 and RPL35A as well as GATA1 in more than 50% of patients. However, the molecular aetiology of many Diamond-Blackfan anaemia cases remains to be uncovered. To identify new mutations responsible for Diamond-Blackfan anaemia, we performed whole-exome sequencing analysis of 48 patients with no documented mutations/deletions involving known Diamond-Blackfan anaemia genes except for RPS7, RPL26, RPS29 and GATA1. Here, we identified a de novo splicing error mutation in RPL27 and frameshift deletion in RPS27 in sporadic patients with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia. In vitro knockdown of gene expression disturbed pre-ribosomal RNA processing. Zebrafish models of rpl27 and rps27 mutations showed impairments of erythrocyte production and tail and/or brain development. Additional novel mutations were found in eight patients, including RPL3L, RPL6, RPL7L1T, RPL8, RPL13, RPL14, RPL18A and RPL31. In conclusion, we identified novel germline mutations of two ribosomal protein genes responsible for Diamond-Blackfan anaemia, further confirming the concept that mutations in ribosomal protein genes lead to Diamond-Blackfan anaemia.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
28343629,Biallelic Variants in OTUD6B Cause an Intellectual Disability Syndrome Associated with Seizures and Dysmorphic Features.,"Ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that regulates many cellular processes including protein degradation, intracellular trafficking, cell signaling, and protein-protein interactions. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which reverse the process of ubiquitination, are important regulators of the ubiquitin system. OTUD6B encodes a member of the ovarian tumor domain (OTU)-containing subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes. Herein, we report biallelic pathogenic variants in OTUD6B in 12 individuals from 6 independent families with an intellectual disability syndrome associated with seizures and dysmorphic features. In subjects with predicted loss-of-function alleles, additional features include global developmental delay, microcephaly, absent speech, hypotonia, growth retardation with prenatal onset, feeding difficulties, structural brain abnormalities, congenital malformations including congenital heart disease, and musculoskeletal features. Homozygous Otud6b knockout mice were subviable, smaller in size, and had congenital heart defects, consistent with the severity of loss-of-function variants in humans. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an affected subject showed reduced incorporation of 19S subunits into 26S proteasomes, decreased chymotrypsin-like activity, and accumulation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. Our findings suggest a role for OTUD6B in proteasome function, establish that defective OTUD6B function underlies a multisystemic human disorder, and provide additional evidence for the emerging relationship between the ubiquitin system and human disease.",brief-report; journal article
28369036,Chromatin-remodeling factor SMARCD2 regulates transcriptional networks controlling differentiation of neutrophil granulocytes.,"We identify SMARCD2 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily D, member 2), also known as BAF60b (BRG1/Brahma-associated factor 60b), as a critical regulator of myeloid differentiation in humans, mice, and zebrafish. Studying patients from three unrelated pedigrees characterized by neutropenia, specific granule deficiency, myelodysplasia with excess of blast cells, and various developmental aberrations, we identified three homozygous loss-of-function mutations in SMARCD2. Using mice and zebrafish as model systems, we showed that SMARCD2 controls early steps in the differentiation of myeloid-erythroid progenitor cells. In vitro, SMARCD2 interacts with the transcription factor CEBPɛ and controls expression of neutrophil proteins stored in specific granules. Defective expression of SMARCD2 leads to transcriptional and chromatin changes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) human promyelocytic cells. In summary, SMARCD2 is a key factor controlling myelopoiesis and is a potential tumor suppressor in leukemia.",research-article; journal article
28318500,"Mutations in TMEM260 Cause a Pediatric Neurodevelopmental, Cardiac, and Renal Syndrome.","Despite the accelerated discovery of genes associated with syndromic traits, the majority of families affected by such conditions remain undiagnosed. Here, we employed whole-exome sequencing in two unrelated consanguineous kindreds with central nervous system (CNS), cardiac, renal, and digit abnormalities. We identified homozygous truncating mutations in TMEM260, a locus predicted to encode numerous splice isoforms. Systematic expression analyses across tissues and developmental stages validated two such isoforms, which differ in the utilization of an internal exon. The mutations in both families map uniquely to the long isoform, raising the possibility of an isoform-specific disorder. Consistent with this notion, RT-PCR of lymphocyte cell lines from one of the kindreds showed reduced levels of only the long isoform, which could be ameliorated by emetine, suggesting that the mutation induces nonsense-mediated decay. Subsequent inÂ vivo testing supported this hypothesis. First, either transient suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of zebrafish tmem260 recapitulated key neurological phenotypes. Second, co-injection of morphants with the long human TMEM260 mRNA rescued CNS pathology, whereas the short isoform was significantly less efficient. Finally, immunocytochemical and biochemical studies showed preferential enrichment of the long TMEM260 isoform to the plasma membrane. Together, our data suggest that there is overall reduced, but not ablated, functionality of TMEM260 and that attenuation of the membrane-associated functions of this protein is a principal driver of pathology. These observations contribute to an appreciation of the roles of splice isoforms in genetic disorders and suggest that dissection of the functions of these transcripts will most likely inform pathomechanism.",brief-report; journal article
28132691,De Novo Disruption of the Proteasome Regulatory Subunit PSMD12 Causes a Syndromic Neurodevelopmental Disorder.,"Degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is an essential biological process in the development of eukaryotic organisms. Dysregulation of this mechanism leads to numerous human neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental disorders. Through a multi-center collaboration, we identified six de novo genomic deletions and four de novo point mutations involving PSMD12, encoding the non-ATPase subunit PSMD12 (aka RPN5) of the 19S regulator of 26S proteasome complex, in unrelated individuals with intellectual disability, congenital malformations, ophthalmologic anomalies, feeding difficulties, deafness, and subtle dysmorphic facial features. We observed reduced PSMD12 levels and an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins without any impairment of proteasome catalytic activity.

28007986,Phospholipase A2-activating protein is associated with a novel form of leukoencephalopathy.,"Leukoencephalopathies are a group of white matter disorders related to abnormal formation, maintenance, and turnover of myelin in the central nervous system. These disorders of the brain are categorized according to neuroradiological and pathophysiological criteria. Herein, we have identified a unique form of leukoencephalopathy in seven patients presenting at ages 2 to 4 months with progressive microcephaly, spastic quadriparesis, and global developmental delay. Clinical, metabolic, and imaging characterization of seven patients followed by homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis were performed. Next generation sequencing, bioinformatics, and segregation analyses followed, to determine a loss of function sequence variation in the phospholipase A2-activating protein encoding gene (PLAA). Expression and functional studies of the encoded protein were performed and included measurement of prostaglandin E2 and cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity in membrane fractions of fibroblasts derived from patients and healthy controls. Plaa-null mice were generated and prostaglandin E2 levels were measured in different tissues. The novel phenotype of our patients segregated with a homozygous loss-of-function sequence variant, causing the substitution of leucine at position 752 to phenylalanine, in PLAA, which causes disruption of the protein's ability to induce prostaglandin E2 and cytosolic phospholipase A2 synthesis in patients' fibroblasts. Plaa-null mice were perinatal lethal with reduced brain levels of prostaglandin E2 The non-functional phospholipase A2-activating protein and the associated neurological phenotype, reported herein for the first time, join other complex phospholipid defects that cause leukoencephalopathies in humans, emphasizing the importance of this axis in white matter development and maintenance.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
28413018,PLAA Mutations Cause a Lethal Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy by Disrupting Ubiquitin-Mediated Endolysosomal Degradation of Synaptic Proteins.,"During neurotransmission, synaptic vesicles undergo multiple rounds of exo-endocytosis, involving recycling and/or degradation of synaptic proteins. While ubiquitin signaling at synapses is essential for neural function, it has been assumed that synaptic proteostasis requires the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). We demonstrate here that turnover of synaptic membrane proteins via the endolysosomal pathway is essential for synaptic function. In both human and mouse, hypomorphic mutations in the ubiquitin adaptor protein PLAA cause an infantile-lethal neurodysfunction syndrome with seizures. Resulting from perturbed endolysosomal degradation, Plaa mutant neurons accumulate K63-polyubiquitylated proteins and synaptic membrane proteins, disrupting synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmission. Through characterization of this neurological intracellular trafficking disorder, we establish the importance of ubiquitin-mediated endolysosomal trafficking at the synapse.",research-article; journal article
28449065,"A homozygous missense mutation in ERAL1, encoding a mitochondrial rRNA chaperone, causes Perrault syndrome.","Perrault syndrome (PS) is a rare recessive disorder characterized by ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural deafness. It is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and previously mutations have been described in different genes, mostly related to mitochondrial proteostasis. We diagnosed three unrelated females with PS and set out to identify the underlying genetic cause using exome sequencing. We excluded mutations in the known PS genes, but identified a single homozygous mutation in the ERAL1 gene (c.707A > T; p.Asn236Ile). Since ERAL1 protein binds to the mitochondrial 12S rRNA and is involved in the assembly of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, the identified variant represented a likely candidate. In silico analysis of a 3D model for ERAL1 suggested that the mutated residue hinders protein-substrate interactions, potentially affecting its function. On a molecular basis, PS skin fibroblasts had reduced ERAL1 protein levels. Complexome profiling of the cells showed an overall decrease in the levels of assembled small ribosomal subunit, indicating that the ERAL1 variant affects mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Moreover, levels of the 12S rRNA were reduced in the patients, and were rescued by lentiviral expression of wild type ERAL1. At the physiological level, mitochondrial respiration was markedly decreased in PS fibroblasts, confirming disturbed mitochondrial function. Finally, knockdown of the C. elegans ERAL1 homologue E02H1.2 almost completely blocked egg production in worms, mimicking the compromised fertility in PS-affected women. Our cross-species data in patient cells and worms support the hypothesis that mutations in ERAL1 can cause PS and are associated with changes in mitochondrial metabolism.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26524591,Additive loss-of-function proteasome subunit mutations in CANDLE/PRAAS patients promote type I IFN production.,"Autosomal recessive mutations in proteasome subunit β 8 (PSMB8), which encodes the inducible proteasome subunit β5i, cause the immune-dysregulatory disease chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE), which is classified as a proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndrome (PRAAS). Here, we identified 8 mutations in 4 proteasome genes, PSMA3 (encodes α7), PSMB4 (encodes β7), PSMB9 (encodes β1i), and proteasome maturation protein (POMP), that have not been previously associated with disease and 1 mutation in PSMB8 that has not been previously reported. One patient was compound heterozygous for PSMB4 mutations, 6 patients from 4 families were heterozygous for a missense mutation in 1 inducible proteasome subunit and a mutation in a constitutive proteasome subunit, and 1 patient was heterozygous for a POMP mutation, thus establishing a digenic and autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of PRAAS. Function evaluation revealed that these mutations variably affect transcription, protein expression, protein folding, proteasome assembly, and, ultimately, proteasome activity. Moreover, defects in proteasome formation and function were recapitulated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of the respective subunits in primary fibroblasts from healthy individuals. Patient-isolated hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells exhibited a strong IFN gene-expression signature, irrespective of genotype. Additionally, chemical proteasome inhibition or progressive depletion of proteasome subunit gene transcription with siRNA induced transcription of type I IFN genes in healthy control cells. Our results provide further insight into CANDLE genetics and link global proteasome dysfunction to increased type I IFN production.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
28334793,Compound heterozygous mutations in the gene PIGP are associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy.,"There are over 150 known human proteins which are tethered to the cell surface via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These proteins play a variety of important roles in development, and particularly in neurogenesis. Not surprisingly, mutations in the GPI anchor biosynthesis and remodeling pathway cause a number of developmental disorders. This group of conditions has been termed inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), a subgroup of congenital disorders of glycosylation; they present with variable phenotypes, often including seizures, hypotonia and intellectual disability. Here, we report two siblings with compound heterozygous variants in the gene phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class P (PIGP) (NM_153681.2: c.74T > C;p.Met25Thr and c.456delA;p.Glu153AsnFs*34). PIGP encodes a subunit of the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis. Both children presented with early-onset refractory seizures, hypotonia, and profound global developmental delay, reminiscent of other IGD phenotypes. Functional studies with patient cells showed reduced PIGP mRNA levels, and an associated reduction of GPI-anchored cell surface proteins, which was rescued by exogenous expression of wild-type PIGP. This work associates mutations in the PIGP gene with a novel autosomal recessive IGD, and expands our knowledge of the role of PIG genes in human development.",journal article; case reports
27657680,A dominant variant in DMXL2 is linked to nonsyndromic hearing loss.,"To explore the genetic etiology of deafness in a dominant family with late-onset, progressive, nonsyndromic hearing loss.Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed for 21 family members. Candidate pathogenic variants were identified by whole-exome sequencing of selected family members and confirmed by Sanger sequencing of all family members. Cochlear expression of Dmxl2 was investigated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunostaining of the organ of Corti from mice.The causative gene was mapped to a 9.68-Mb candidate region on chromosome 15q21.2 (maximum logarithm of the odds score = 4.03) that contained no previously described deafness genes. Whole-exome sequencing identified heterozygous c.7250G>A (p.Arg2417His) in DMXL2 as the only candidate pathogenic variant segregating the hearing loss. In mouse cochlea, expression of DMXL2 was restricted to the hair cells and the spiral ganglion neurons.Our data indicated that the p.Arg2417His variant in DMXL2 is associated with dominant, nonsyndromic hearing loss and suggested an important role of DMXL2 in inner ear function.Genet Med advance online publication 22 September 2016.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
28625504,"Mutations in ARMC9, which Encodes a Basal Body Protein, Cause Joubert Syndrome in Humans and Ciliopathy Phenotypes in Zebrafish.","Joubert syndrome (JS) is a recessive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hypotonia, ataxia, abnormal eye movements, and variable cognitive impairment. It is defined by a distinctive brain malformation known as the ""molar tooth sign"" on axial MRI. Subsets of affected individuals have malformations such as coloboma, polydactyly, and encephalocele, as well as progressive retinal dystrophy, fibrocystic kidney disease, and liver fibrosis. More than 35 genes have been associated with JS, but in a subset of families the genetic cause remains unknown. All of the gene products localize in and around the primary cilium, making JS a canonical ciliopathy. Ciliopathies are unified by their overlapping clinical features and underlying mechanisms involving ciliary dysfunction. In this work, we identify biallelic rare, predicted-deleterious ARMC9 variants (stop-gain, missense, splice-site, and single-exon deletion) in 11 individuals with JS from 8 families, accounting for approximately 1% of the disorder. The associated phenotypes range from isolated neurological involvement to JS with retinal dystrophy, additional brain abnormalities (e.g., heterotopia, Dandy-Walker malformation), pituitary insufficiency, and/or synpolydactyly. We show that ARMC9 localizes to the basal body of the cilium and is upregulated during ciliogenesis. Typical ciliopathy phenotypes (curved body shape, retinal dystrophy, coloboma, and decreased cilia) in a CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish mutant model provide additional support for ARMC9 as a ciliopathy-associated gene. Identifying ARMC9 mutations as a cause of JS takes us one step closer to a full genetic understanding of this important disorder and enables future functional work to define the central biological mechanisms underlying JS and other ciliopathies.",research-article; journal article
26282398,EPS8L2 is a new causal gene for childhood onset autosomal recessive progressive hearing loss.,"More than 70 % of the cases of congenital deafness are of genetic origin, of which approximately 80 % are non-syndromic and show autosomal recessive transmission (DFNB forms). To date, 60 DFNB genes have been identified, most of which cause congenital, severe to profound deafness, whereas a few cause delayed progressive deafness in childhood. We report the study of two Algerian siblings born to consanguineous parents, and affected by progressive hearing loss.After exclusion of GJB2 (the gene most frequently involved in non-syndromic deafness in Mediterranean countries), we performed whole-exome sequencing in one sibling.A frame-shift variant (c.1014delC; p.Ser339Alafs*15) was identified in EPS8L2, encoding Epidermal growth factor receptor Pathway Substrate 8 L2, a protein of hair cells' stereocilia previously implicated in progressive deafness in the mouse. This variant predicts a truncated, inactive protein, or no protein at all owing to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. It was detected at the homozygous state in the two clinically affected siblings, and at the heterozygous state in the unaffected parents and one unaffected sibling, whereas it was never found in a control population of 150 Algerians with normal hearing or in the Exome Variant Server database.Whole-exome sequencing allowed us to identify a new gene responsible for childhood progressive hearing loss transmitted on the autosomal recessive mode.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"

We reported that the loss of Wbp2 expression leads to progressive high-frequency hearing loss in mouse, as well as in two deaf children, each carrying two different variants in the WBP2 gene. The earliest abnormality we detect in Wbp2-deficient mice is a primary defect at inner hair cell afferent synapses. This study defines a new gene involved in the molecular pathway linking hearing impairment to hormonal signalling and provides new therapeutic targets.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
27162350,ROR1 is essential for proper innervation of auditory hair cells and hearing in humans and mice.,"Hair cells of the inner ear, the mechanosensory receptors, convert sound waves into neural signals that are passed to the brain via the auditory nerve. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern the development of hair cell-neuronal connections. We ascertained a family with autosomal recessive deafness associated with a common cavity inner ear malformation and auditory neuropathy. Via whole-exome sequencing, we identified a variant (c.2207G>C, p.R736T) in ROR1 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1), cosegregating with deafness in the family and absent in ethnicity-matched controls. ROR1 is a tyrosine kinase-like receptor localized at the plasma membrane. At the cellular level, the mutation prevents the protein from reaching the cellular membrane. In the presence of WNT5A, a known ROR1 ligand, the mutated ROR1 fails to activate NF-κB. Ror1 is expressed in the inner ear during development at embryonic and postnatal stages. We demonstrate that Ror1 mutant mice are severely deaf, with preserved otoacoustic emissions. Anatomically, mutant mice display malformed cochleae. Axons of spiral ganglion neurons show fasciculation defects. Type I neurons show impaired synapses with inner hair cells, and type II neurons display aberrant projections through the cochlear sensory epithelium. We conclude that Ror1 is crucial for spiral ganglion neurons to innervate auditory hair cells. Impairment of ROR1 function largely affects development of the inner ear and hearing in humans and mice.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
28886341,"CDK10 Mutations in Humans and Mice Cause Severe Growth Retardation, Spine Malformations, and Developmental Delays.","In five separate families, we identified nine individuals affected by a previously unidentified syndrome characterized by growth retardation, spine malformation, facial dysmorphisms, and developmental delays. Using homozygosity mapping, array CGH, and exome sequencing, we uncovered bi-allelic loss-of-function CDK10 mutations segregating with this disease. CDK10 is a protein kinase that partners with cyclin M to phosphorylate substrates such as ETS2 and PKN2 in order to modulate cellular growth. To validate and model the pathogenicity of these CDK10 germline mutations, we generated conditional-knockout mice. Homozygous Cdk10-knockout mice died postnatally with severe growth retardation, skeletal defects, and kidney and lung abnormalities, symptoms that partly resemble the disease's effect in humans. Fibroblasts derived from affected individuals and Cdk10-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) proliferated normally; however, Cdk10-knockout MEFs developed longer cilia. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of mutant and wild-type mouse organs revealed lipid metabolic changes consistent with growth impairment and altered ciliogenesis in the absence of CDK10. Our results document the CDK10 loss-of-function phenotype and point to a function for CDK10 in transducing signals received at the primary cilia to sustain embryonic and postnatal development.",research-article; journal article
28886345,RAC1 Missense Mutations in Developmental Disorders with Diverse Phenotypes.,"RAC1 is a widely studied Rho GTPase, a class of molecules that modulate numerous cellular functions essential for normal development. RAC1 is highly conserved across species and is under strict mutational constraint. We report seven individuals with distinct de novo missense RAC1 mutations and varying degrees of developmental delay, brain malformations, and additional phenotypes. Four individuals, each harboring one of c.53G>A (p.Cys18Tyr), c.116A>G (p.Asn39Ser), c.218C>T (p.Pro73Leu), and c.470G>A (p.Cys157Tyr) variants, were microcephalic, with head circumferences between -2.5 to -5 SD. In contrast, two individuals with c.151G>A (p.Val51Met) and c.151G>C (p.Val51Leu) alleles were macrocephalic with head circumferences of +4.16 and +4.5 SD. One individual harboring a c.190T>G (p.Tyr64Asp) allele had head circumference in the normal range. Collectively, we observed an extraordinary spread of ∼10 SD of head circumferences orchestrated by distinct mutations in the same gene. In silico modeling, mouse fibroblasts spreading assays, and in vivo overexpression assays using zebrafish as a surrogate model demonstrated that the p.Cys18Tyr and p.Asn39Ser RAC1 variants function as dominant-negative alleles and result in microcephaly, reduced neuronal proliferation, and cerebellar abnormalities in vivo. Conversely, the p.Tyr64Asp substitution is constitutively active. The remaining mutations are probably weakly dominant negative or their effects are context dependent. These findings highlight the importance of RAC1 in neuronal development. Along with TRIO and HACE1, a sub-category of rare developmental disorders is emerging with RAC1 as the central player. We show that ultra-rare disorders caused by private, non-recurrent missense mutations that result in varying phenotypes are challenging to dissect, but can be delineated through focused international collaboration.",brief-report; journal article
29069077,Functional convergence of histone methyltransferases EHMT1 and KMT2C involved in intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.,"Kleefstra syndrome, caused by haploinsufficiency of euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1), is characterized by intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characteristic facial dysmorphisms, and other variable clinical features. In addition to EHMT1 mutations, de novo variants were reported in four additional genes (MBD5, SMARCB1, NR1I3, and KMT2C), in single individuals with clinical characteristics overlapping Kleefstra syndrome. Here, we present a novel cohort of five patients with de novo loss of function mutations affecting the histone methyltransferase KMT2C. Our clinical data delineates the KMT2C phenotypic spectrum and reinforces the phenotypic overlap with Kleefstra syndrome and other related ID disorders. To elucidate the common molecular basis of the neuropathology associated with mutations in KMT2C and EHMT1, we characterized the role of the Drosophila KMT2C ortholog, trithorax related (trr), in the nervous system. Similar to the Drosophila EHMT1 ortholog, G9a, trr is required in the mushroom body for short term memory. Trr ChIP-seq identified 3371 binding sites, mainly in the promoter of genes involved in neuronal processes. Transcriptional profiling of pan-neuronal trr knockdown and G9a null mutant fly heads identified 613 and 1123 misregulated genes, respectively. These gene sets show a significant overlap and are associated with nearly identical gene ontology enrichments. The majority of the observed biological convergence is derived from predicted indirect target genes. However, trr and G9a also have common direct targets, including the Drosophila ortholog of Arc (Arc1), a key regulator of synaptic plasticity. Our data highlight the clinical and molecular convergence between the KMT2 and EHMT protein families, which may contribute to a molecular network underlying a larger group of ID/ASD-related disorders.",research-article; journal article
28691929,Biallelic mutations in the ubiquitin ligase RFWD3 cause Fanconi anemia.,"The WD40-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase RFWD3 has been recently linked to the repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination (HR). Here we have shown that an RFWD3 mutation within the WD40 domain is connected to the genetic disease Fanconi anemia (FA). An individual presented with congenital abnormalities characteristic of FA. Cells from the patient carrying the compound heterozygous mutations c.205_206dupCC and c.1916T>A in RFWD3 showed increased sensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents in terms of increased chromosomal breakage, reduced survival, and cell cycle arrest in G2 phase. The cellular phenotype was mirrored in genetically engineered human and avian cells by inactivation of RFWD3 or introduction of the patient-derived missense mutation, and the phenotype was rescued by expression of wild-type RFWD3 protein. HR was disrupted in RFWD3-mutant cells as a result of impaired relocation of mutant RFWD3 to chromatin and defective physical interaction with replication protein A. Rfwd3 knockout mice appear to have increased embryonic lethality, are subfertile, show ovarian and testicular atrophy, and have a reduced lifespan resembling that of other FA mouse models. Although RFWD3 mutations have thus far been detected in a single child with FA, we propose RFWD3 as an FA gene, FANCW, supported by cellular paradigm systems and an animal model.",research-article; journal article; case reports
26238514,Mutations in ARID2 are associated with intellectual disabilities.,"The etiology of intellectual disabilities (ID) remains unknown for the majority of patients. Due to reduced reproductive fitness in many individuals with ID, de novo mutations account for a significant portion of severe ID. The ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin modifier has been linked with neurodevelopmental disorders including ID and autism. ARID2 is an intrinsic component of polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), the SWI/SNF subcomplex. In this study, we used clinical whole exome sequencing (WES) in proband-parent-trios to identify the etiology of ID. We identified four independent, novel, loss of function variants in ARID2 gene in four patients, three of which were confirmed to be de novo. The patients all have ID and share other clinical characteristics including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, short stature, dysmorphic facial features, and Wormian bones. All four novel variants are predicted to lead to a premature termination with the loss of the two conservative zinc finger motifs. This is the first report of mutations in ARID2 associated with developmental delay and ID.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
24601690,Thioredoxin Reductase 2 (TXNRD2) mutation associated with familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD).,"CONTEXT:Classic ACTH resistance, due to disruption of ACTH signaling, accounts for the majority of cases of familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD). Recently FGD cases caused by mutations in the mitochondrial antioxidant, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, have highlighted the importance of redox regulation in steroidogenesis. OBJECTIVE:We hypothesized that other components of mitochondrial antioxidant systems would be good candidates in the etiology of FGD. DESIGN:Whole-exome sequencing was performed on three related patients, and segregation of putative causal variants confirmed by Sanger sequencing of all family members. A TXNRD2-knockdown H295R cell line was created to investigate redox homeostasis. SETTING:The study was conducted on patients from three pediatric centers in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS:Seven individuals from a consanguineous Kashmiri kindred, six of whom presented with FGD between 0.1 and 10.8 years, participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS:There were no interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:Identification and functional interrogation of a novel homozygous mutation segregating with the disease trait were measured. RESULTS:A stop gain mutation, p.Y447X in TXNRD2, encoding the mitochondrial selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase 2 (TXNRD2) was identified and segregated with disease in this extended kindred. RT-PCR and Western blotting revealed complete absence of TXNRD2 in patients homozygous for the mutation. TXNRD2 deficiency leads to impaired redox homeostasis in a human adrenocortical cell line. CONCLUSION:In contrast to the Txnrd2-knockout mouse model, in which embryonic lethality as a consequence of hematopoietic and cardiac defects is described, absence of TXNRD2 in humans leads to glucocorticoid deficiency. This is the first report of a homozygous mutation in any component of the thioredoxin antioxidant system leading to inherited disease in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
29100083,High Rate of Recurrent De Novo Mutations in Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies.,"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is a group of conditions characterized by the co-occurrence of epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID), typically with developmental plateauing or regression associated with frequent epileptiform activity. The cause of DEE remains unknown in the majority of cases. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in 197 individuals with unexplained DEE and pharmaco-resistant seizures and in their unaffected parents. We focused our attention on de novo mutations (DNMs) and identified candidate genes containing such variants. We sought to identify additional subjects with DNMs in these genes by performing targeted sequencing in another series of individuals with DEE and by mining various sequencing datasets. We also performed meta-analyses to document enrichment of DNMs in candidate genes by leveraging our WGS dataset with those of several DEE and ID series. By combining these strategies, we were able to provide a causal link between DEE and the following genes: NTRK2, GABRB2, CLTC, DHDDS, NUS1, RAB11A, GABBR2, and SNAP25. Overall, we established a molecular diagnosis in 63/197 (32%) individuals in our WGS series. The main cause of DEE in these individuals was de novo point mutations (53/63 solved cases), followed by inherited mutations (6/63 solved cases) and de novo CNVs (4/63 solved cases). De novo missense variants explained a larger proportion of individuals in our series than in other series that were primarily ascertained because of ID. Moreover, these DNMs were more frequently recurrent than those identified in ID series. These observations indicate that the genetic landscape of DEE might be different from that of ID without epilepsy.",meta-analysis; research-article; journal article
28375157,Isolated polycystic liver disease genes define effectors of polycystin-1 function.,"Dominantly inherited isolated polycystic liver disease (PCLD) consists of liver cysts that are radiologically and pathologically identical to those seen in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, but without clinically relevant kidney cysts. The causative genes are known for fewer than 40% of PCLD index cases. Here, we have used whole exome sequencing in a discovery cohort of 102 unrelated patients who were excluded for mutations in the 2 most common PCLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, to identify heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in 3 additional genes, ALG8, GANAB, and SEC61B. Similarly to PRKCSH and SEC63, these genes encode proteins that are integral to the protein biogenesis pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. We inactivated these candidate genes in cell line models to show that loss of function of each results in defective maturation and trafficking of polycystin-1, the central determinant of cyst pathogenesis. Despite acting in a common pathway, each PCLD gene product demonstrated distinct effects on polycystin-1 biogenesis. We also found enrichment on a genome-wide basis of heterozygous mutations in the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease gene PKHD1, indicating that adult PKHD1 carriers can present with clinical PCLD. These findings define genetic and biochemical modulators of polycystin-1 function and provide a more complete definition of the spectrum of dominant human polycystic diseases.",research-article; journal article
24706814,Whole-exome sequencing reveals LRP5 mutations and canonical Wnt signaling associated with hepatic cystogenesis.,"Polycystic livers are seen in the rare inherited disorder isolated polycystic liver disease (PCLD) and are recognized as the most common extrarenal manifestation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Hepatic cystogenesis is characterized by progressive proliferation of cholangiocytes, ultimately causing hepatomegaly. Genetically, polycystic liver disease is a heterogeneous disorder with incomplete penetrance and caused by mutations in PRKCSH, SEC63, PKD1, or PKD2. Genome-wide SNP typing and Sanger sequencing revealed no pathogenic variants in hitherto genes in an extended PCLD family. We performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA samples from two members. A heterozygous variant c.3562C > T located at a highly conserved amino acid position (p.R1188W) in the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene segregated with the disease (logarithm of odds score, 4.62) but was not observed in more than 1,000 unaffected individuals. Screening of LRP5 in a PCLD cohort identified three additional mutations in three unrelated families with polycystic livers (p.V454M, p.R1529S, and p.D1551N), again all undetected in controls. All variants were predicted to be damaging with profound structural effects on LRP5 protein domains. Liver cyst tissue and normal hepatic tissue samples from patients and controls showed abundant LRP5 expression by immunohistochemistry. Functional activity analyses indicated that mutant LRP5 led to reduced wingless signal activation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that germ-line LRP5 missense mutations are associated with hepatic cystogenesis. The findings presented in this study link the pathophysiology of PCLD to deregulation of the canonical wingless signaling pathway.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
27158779,The ciliopathy-associated CPLANE proteins direct basal body recruitment of intraflagellar transport machinery.,"Cilia use microtubule-based intraflagellar transport (IFT) to organize intercellular signaling. Ciliopathies are a spectrum of human diseases resulting from defects in cilia structure or function. The mechanisms regulating the assembly of ciliary multiprotein complexes and the transport of these complexes to the base of cilia remain largely unknown. Combining proteomics, in vivo imaging and genetic analysis of proteins linked to planar cell polarity (Inturned, Fuzzy and Wdpcp), we identified and characterized a new genetic module, which we term CPLANE (ciliogenesis and planar polarity effector), and an extensive associated protein network. CPLANE proteins physically and functionally interact with the poorly understood ciliopathy-associated protein Jbts17 at basal bodies, where they act to recruit a specific subset of IFT-A proteins. In the absence of CPLANE, defective IFT-A particles enter the axoneme and IFT-B trafficking is severely perturbed. Accordingly, mutation of CPLANE genes elicits specific ciliopathy phenotypes in mouse models and is associated with ciliopathies in human patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27060890,Autosomal recessive IFT57 hypomorphic mutation cause ciliary transport defect in unclassified oral-facial-digital syndrome with short stature and brachymesophalangia.,"The 13 subtypes of oral-facial-digital syndrome (OFDS) belong to the heterogeneous group of ciliopathies. Disease-causing genes encode for centrosomal proteins, components of the transition zone or proteins implicated in ciliary signaling. A unique consanguineous family presenting with an unclassified OFDS with skeletal dysplasia and brachymesophalangia was explored. Homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing led to the identification of a homozygous mutation in IFT57, which encodes a protein implicated in ciliary transport. The mutation caused splicing anomalies with reduced expression of the wild-type transcript and protein. Both anterograde ciliary transport and sonic hedgehog signaling were significantly decreased in subjects' fibroblasts compared with controls. Sanger sequencing of IFT57 in 13 OFDS subjects and 12 subjects with Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome was negative. This report identifies the implication of IFT57 in human pathology and highlights the first description of a ciliary transport defect in OFDS, extending the genetic heterogeneity of this subgroup of ciliopathies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
21637541,"Biochemical and genetic analysis of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in a family, due to prolonged neuromuscular blockade after the use of succinylcholine.","Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a plasma enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of choline esters, including the muscle-relaxant succinylcholine and mivacurium. Patients who present sustained neuromuscular blockade after using succinylcholine usually carry BChE variants with reduced enzyme activity or an acquired BChE deficiency. We report here the molecular basis of the BCHE gene underlying the slow catabolism of succinylcholine in a patient who underwent endoscopic nasal surgery. We measured the enzyme activity of BChE and extracted genomic DNA in order to study the promoter region and all exons of the BCHE gene of the patient, her parents and siblings. PCR products were sequenced and compared with reference sequences from GenBank. We detected that the patient and one of her brothers have two homozygous mutations: nt1615 GCA > ACA (Ala539Thr), responsible for the K variant, and nt209 GAT > GGT (Asp70Gly), which produces the atypical variant A. Her parents and two of her brothers were found to be heterozygous for the AK allele, and another brother is homozygous for the normal allele. Sequence analysis of exon 1 including 5'UTR showed that the proband and her brother are homozygous for -116GG. The AK/AK genotype is considered the most frequent in hereditary hypocholinesterasemia (44%). This work demonstrates the importance of defining the phenotype and genotype of the BCHE gene in patients who are subjected to neuromuscular block by succinylcholine, because of the risk of prolonged neuromuscular paralysis.",brief-report; journal article
9163587,Spectrin Cosenza: a novel beta chain variant associated with Sp alphaI/74 hereditary elliptocytosis.,"A Calabrian family (Southern Italy) with Sp alpha(I/74) hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) in the heterozygous state was studied. Sp alpha(I/74) HE is associated with asymptomatic elliptocytosis, a defect in spectrin dimer self association and an increase of the alpha(I/74) kD fragment from the alpha chain after partial tryptic digestion of spectrin. To identify the underlying molecular defect, we analysed exons V, W, X, Y, Z of the beta gene and exon 2 of the alpha gene by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) of the amplification products. Direct DNA sequencing of the mutant exon showed a C-->G substitution at position 6284 of the beta gene. The corresponding substitution at the protein level was Arg-->Pro in the 2064 position of the beta-spectrin chain.",journal article
3580577,Spectrin Nice (beta 220/216): a shortened beta-chain variant associated with an increase of the alpha I/74 fragment in a case of elliptocytosis.,"We describe a new spectrin variant with a truncated beta-chain. It was discovered in a 17-year-old white boy presenting with intermittent jaundice and spleen enlargement. He also displayed numerous smooth elliptocytes. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, the truncated beta-chain (beta'-chain) appeared as an additional band of approximately 216 kilodaltons, migrating between spectrin beta-chain and ankyrin. It represented 30% of total beta-chain. The beta'-chain reacted with an antispectrin beta-chain monoclonal antibody. It failed to become phosphorylated when ghosts were incubated in the presence of [gamma-32P] adenosine triphosphate. Whole spectrin tetramerization was defective since the amount of spectrin dimer was increased in spectrin crude extract and the association constant of the spectrin dimer self-association was decreased. Spectrin whole tetramer isolated from spectrin crude extracts contained small quantities of beta'-chain. Spectrin tryptic peptides showed an increase of the 74,000-dalton fragment at the expense of the 80,000-dalton fragment. So far, the latter abnormality has been used to characterize a number of cases of hereditary elliptocytosis or pyropoikilocytosis with no other apparent change. In the present case, we consider that the abnormality is a consequence of the beta-chain alteration. The parents seemed asymptomatic. As a result, we regard this new spectrin variant as deriving from a de novo mutation.","research-article; validation studies; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29358272,FAM46A mutations are responsible for autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta.,"BACKGROUND:Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS) is characterised by bowing of the lower limbs, respiratory distress and hyperthermia that are often responsible for early death. Survivors develop progressive scoliosis and spontaneous fractures. We previously identified LIFR mutations in most SWS cases, but absence of LIFR pathogenic changes in five patients led us to perform exome sequencing and to identify homozygosity for a FAM46A mutation in one case [p.Ser205Tyrfs*13]. The follow-up of this case supported a final diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), based on vertebral collapses and blue sclerae. METHODS AND RESULTS:This prompted us to screen FAM46A in 25 OI patients with no known mutations.We identified a homozygous deleterious variant in FAM46A in two affected sibs with typical OI [p.His127Arg]. Another homozygous variant, [p.Asp231Gly], also classed as deleterious, was detected in a patient with type III OI of consanguineous parents using homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing.FAM46A is a member of the superfamily of nucleotidyltransferase fold proteins but its exact function is presently unknown. Nevertheless, there are lines of evidence pointing to a relevant role of FAM46A in bone development. By RT-PCR analysis, we detected specific expression of FAM46A in human osteoblasts andinterestingly, a nonsense mutation in Fam46a has been recently identified in an ENU-derived (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) mouse model characterised by decreased body length, limb, rib, pelvis, and skull deformities and reduced cortical thickness in long bones. CONCLUSION:We conclude that FAM46A mutations are responsible for a severe form of OI with congenital bowing of the lower limbs and suggest screening this gene in unexplained OI forms.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29606301,Absence of CFAP69 Causes Male Infertility due to Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the Flagella in Human and Mouse.,"The multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) phenotype is among the most severe forms of sperm defects responsible for male infertility. The phenotype is characterized by the presence in the ejaculate of immotile spermatozoa with severe flagellar abnormalities including flagella being short, coiled, absent, and of irregular caliber. Recent studies have demonstrated that MMAF is genetically heterogeneous, and genes thus far associated with MMAF account for only one-third of cases. Here we report the identification of homozygous truncating mutations (one stop-gain and one splicing variant) in CFAP69 of two unrelated individuals by whole-exome sequencing of a cohort of 78 infertile men with MMAF. CFAP69 encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein found at high levels in the testis. Immunostaining experiments in sperm from fertile control individuals showed that CFAP69 localized to the midpiece of the flagellum, and the absence of CFAP69 was confirmed in both individuals carrying CFPA69 mutations. Additionally, we found that sperm from a Cfap69 knockout mouse model recapitulated the MMAF phenotype. Ultrastructural analysis of testicular sperm from the knockout mice showed severe disruption of flagellum structure, but histological analysis of testes from these mice revealed the presence of all stages of the seminiferous epithelium, indicating that the overall progression of spermatogenesis is preserved and that the sperm defects likely arise during spermiogenesis. Together, our data indicate that CFAP69 is necessary for flagellum assembly/stability and that in both humans and mice, biallelic truncating mutations in CFAP69 cause autosomal-recessive MMAF and primary male infertility.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26416264,PDZD7 and hearing loss: More than just a modifier.,"Deafness is the most frequent sensory disorder. With over 90 genes and 110 loci causally implicated in non-syndromic hearing loss, it is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. Here, we investigate the genetic etiology of deafness in four families of Iranian origin segregating autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). We used a combination of linkage analysis, homozygosity mapping, and a targeted genomic enrichment platform to simultaneously screen 90 known deafness-causing genes for pathogenic variants. Variant segregation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping showed segregation with the DFNB57 locus on chromosome 10 in two families. Targeted genomic enrichment with massively parallel sequencing identified causal variants in PDZD7: a homozygous missense variant (p.Gly103Arg) in one family and compound heterozygosity for missense (p.Met285Arg) and nonsense (p.Tyr500Ter) variants in the second family. Screening of two additional families identified two more variants: (p.Gly228Arg) and (p.Gln526Ter). Variant segregation with the hearing loss phenotype was confirmed in all families by Sanger sequencing. The missense variants are predicted to be deleterious, and the two nonsense mutations produce null alleles. This report is the first to show that mutations in PDZD7 cause ARNSHL, a finding that offers addition insight into the USH2 interactome. We also describe a novel likely disease-causing mutation in CIB2 and illustrate the complexity associated with gene identification in diseases that exhibit large genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26849169,Confirmation of PDZD7 as a Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss Gene.,"PDZD7 was identified in 2009 in a family with apparent nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. However, subsequent clinical reports have associated PDZD7 with digenic Usher syndrome, the most common cause of deaf-blindness, or as a modifier of retinal disease. No further reports have validated this gene for nonsyndromic hearing loss, intuitively calling correct genotype-phenotype association into question. This report describes a validating second case for biallelic mutations in PDZD7 causing nonsyndromic mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss. It also provides detailed audiometric and ophthalmologic data excluding Usher syndrome in both the present proband (proband 1) and the first proband described in 2009 (proband 2).Proband 1 was sequenced using a custom-designed next generation sequencing panel consisting of 151 deafness genes. Bioinformatics analysis and filtering disclosed two PDZD7 sequence variants (c.1648C>T, p.Q550* and c.2107del, p.S703Vfs*20). Segregation testing followed in the family. For both probands, audiograms were collected and analyzed for progressive hearing loss and detailed ophthalmic evaluations were performed including electroretinography.Proband 1 demonstrated a prelingual, nonsyndromic, sensorineural hearing loss that progressed in the higher frequencies between 4 and 9 years old. PDZD7 segregation analysis confirmed biallelic inheritance (compound heterozygosity). Mutation analysis determined the c.1648C>T mutation as novel and reported the c.2107del deletion as rs397516633 with a calculated minor allele frequency of 0.000018. Clinical evaluation spanning well over a decade in proband 2 disclosed bilateral, nonprogressive hearing loss. Both probands showed healthy retinas, excluding Usher syndrome-like changes in the eye.PDZD7 is confirmed as a bona fide autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss gene. In both probands, there was no evidence of impaired vision or ophthalmic pathology. As the current understanding of PDZD7 mutations bridge Mendelian and complex phenotypes, the authors recommend careful variant interpretation, since PDZD7 is one of many genes associated with both Usher syndrome and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. Additional reports are required for understanding the complete phenotypic spectrum of this gene, including the possibility of high-frequency progression, as well as noise-induced hearing loss susceptibility in adult carriers. This report rules out all forms of Usher syndrome with an onset before 12 and 15 years old in probands 1 and 2, respectively. However, due to the young ages of the probands, this report is uninformative regarding older patients.",journal article
29740699,"De novo mutations in MED13, a component of the Mediator complex, are associated with a novel neurodevelopmental disorder.","Many genetic causes of developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (DD/ID) are extremely rare, and robust discovery of these requires both large-scale DNA sequencing and data sharing. Here we describe a GeneMatcher collaboration which led to a cohort of 13 affected individuals harboring protein-altering variants, 11 of which are de novo, in MED13; the only inherited variant was transmitted to an affected child from an affected mother. All patients had intellectual disability and/or developmental delays, including speech delays or disorders. Other features that were reported in two or more patients include autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, optic nerve abnormalities, Duane anomaly, hypotonia, mild congenital heart abnormalities, and dysmorphisms. Six affected individuals had mutations that are predicted to truncate the MED13 protein, six had missense mutations, and one had an in-frame-deletion of one amino acid. Out of the seven non-truncating mutations, six clustered in two specific locations of the MED13 protein: an N-terminal and C-terminal region. The four N-terminal clustering mutations affect two adjacent amino acids that are known to be involved in MED13 ubiquitination and degradation, p.Thr326 and p.Pro327. MED13 is a component of the CDK8-kinase module that can reversibly bind Mediator, a multi-protein complex that is required for Polymerase II transcription initiation. Mutations in several other genes encoding subunits of Mediator have been previously shown to associate with DD/ID, including MED13L, a paralog of MED13. Thus, our findings add MED13 to the group of CDK8-kinase module-associated disease genes.",research-article; journal article
29603516,A PIGH mutation leading to GPI deficiency is associated with developmental delay and autism.,"We identified an individual with a homozygous missense variant (p.Ser103Pro) in a conserved residue of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis gene PIGH. This gene encodes an essential component of the phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex, in the first step of the biosynthesis of GPI, a glycolipid anchor added to more than one hundred human proteins, several being critical for embryogenesis and neurological functions. The affected individual had hypotonia, moderate developmental delay, and autism. Unlike other reported individuals with GPI deficiency, the proband did not have epilepsy; however, he did have two episodes of febrile seizures. He had normal alkaline phosphatase and no brachytelephalangy. Upon analysis of the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins on granulocytes, he was demonstrated to have GPI deficiency. This suggests that PIGH mutations may cause a syndrome with developmental delay and autism, but without an epileptic encephalopathy, and should increase the awareness of the potentially deleterious nature of biallelic variants in this gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29573052,"A homozygous variant disrupting the PIGH start-codon is associated with developmental delay, epilepsy, and microcephaly.","Defective glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biogenesis can cause a spectrum of predominantly neurological problems. For eight genes critical to this biological process, disease associations are not yet reported. Scanning exomes from 7,833 parent-child trios and 1,792 singletons from the DDD study for biallelic variants in this gene-set uncovered a rare PIGH variant in a boy with epilepsy, microcephaly, and behavioral difficulties. Although only 2/2 reads harbored this c.1A > T transversion, the presence of ∼25 Mb autozygosity at this locus implied homozygosity, which was confirmed using Sanger sequencing. A similarly-affected sister was also homozygous. FACS analysis of PIGH-deficient CHO cells indicated that cDNAs with c.1A > T could not efficiently restore expression of GPI-APs. Truncation of PIGH protein was consistent with the utilization of an in-frame start-site at codon 63. In summary, we describe siblings harboring a homozygous c.1A > T variant resulting in defective GPI-anchor biogenesis and highlight the importance of exploring low-coverage variants within autozygous regions.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
28180185,Precision therapy for a new disorder of AMPA receptor recycling due to mutations in ATAD1.,"OBJECTIVE:ATAD1 encodes Thorase, a mediator of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionate (AMPA) receptor recycling; in this work, we characterized the phenotype resulting from ATAD1 mutations and developed a targeted therapy in both mice and humans. METHODS:Using exome sequencing, we identified a novel ATAD1 mutation (p.E276X) as the etiology of a devastating neurologic disorder characterized by hypertonia, seizures, and death in a consanguineous family. We postulated that pathogenesis was a result of excessive AMPA receptor activity and designed a targeted therapeutic approach using perampanel, an AMPA-receptor antagonist. RESULTS:Perampanel therapy in ATAD1 knockout mice reversed behavioral defects, normalized brain MRI abnormalities, prevented seizures, and prolonged survival. The ATAD1 patients treated with perampanel showed improvement in hypertonicity and resolution of seizures. CONCLUSIONS:This work demonstrates that identification of novel monogenic neurologic disorders and observation of response to targeted therapeutics can provide important insights into human nervous system functioning.",research-article; journal article
29107558,ESRP1 Mutations Cause Hearing Loss due to Defects in Alternative Splicing that Disrupt Cochlear Development.,"Alternative splicing contributes to gene expression dynamics in many tissues, yet its role in auditory development remains unclear. We performed whole-exome sequencing in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and identified pathogenic mutations in Epithelial Splicing-Regulatory Protein 1 (ESRP1). Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells showed alternative splicing defects that were restored upon repair of an ESRP1 mutant allele. To determine how ESRP1 mutations cause hearing loss, we evaluated Esrp1-/- mouse embryos and uncovered alterations in cochlear morphogenesis, auditory hair cell differentiation, and cell fate specification. Transcriptome analysis revealed impaired expression and splicing of genes with essential roles in cochlea development and auditory function. Aberrant splicing of Fgfr2 blocked stria vascularis formation due to erroneous ligand usage, which was corrected by reducing Fgf9 gene dosage. These findings implicate mutations in ESRP1 as a cause of SNHL and demonstrate the complex interplay between alternative splicing, inner ear development, and auditory function.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29656859,Dual Molecular Effects of Dominant RORA Mutations Cause Two Variants of Syndromic Intellectual Disability with Either Autism or Cerebellar Ataxia.,"RORα, the RAR-related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, is essential for cerebellar development. The spontaneous mutant mouse staggerer, with an ataxic gait caused by neurodegeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, was discovered two decades ago to result from homozygous intragenic Rora deletions. However, RORA mutations were hitherto undocumented in humans. Through a multi-centric collaboration, we identified three copy-number variant deletions (two de novo and one dominantly inherited in three generations), one de novo disrupting duplication, and nine de novo point mutations (three truncating, one canonical splice site, and five missense mutations) involving RORA in 16 individuals from 13 families with variable neurodevelopmental delay and intellectual disability (ID)-associated autistic features, cerebellar ataxia, and epilepsy. Consistent with the human and mouse data, disruption of the D. rerio ortholog, roraa, causes significant reduction in the size of the developing cerebellum. Systematic in vivo complementation studies showed that, whereas wild-type human RORA mRNA could complement the cerebellar pathology, missense variants had two distinct pathogenic mechanisms of either haploinsufficiency or a dominant toxic effect according to their localization in the ligand-binding or DNA-binding domains, respectively. This dichotomous direction of effect is likely relevant to the phenotype in humans: individuals with loss-of-function variants leading to haploinsufficiency show ID with autistic features, while individuals with de novo dominant toxic variants present with ID, ataxia, and cerebellar atrophy. Our combined genetic and functional data highlight the complex mutational landscape at the human RORA locus and suggest that dual mutational effects likely determine phenotypic outcome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29507423,Expansions of intronic TTTCA and TTTTA repeats in benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy.,"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, and mutations in genes encoding ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors are frequent causes of monogenic forms of epilepsy. Here we show that abnormal expansions of TTTCA and TTTTA repeats in intron 4 of SAMD12 cause benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME). Single-molecule, real-time sequencing of BAC clones and nanopore sequencing of genomic DNA identified two repeat configurations in SAMD12. Intriguingly, in two families with a clinical diagnosis of BAFME in which no repeat expansions in SAMD12 were observed, we identified similar expansions of TTTCA and TTTTA repeats in introns of TNRC6A and RAPGEF2, indicating that expansions of the same repeat motifs are involved in the pathogenesis of BAFME regardless of the genes in which the expanded repeats are located. This discovery that expansions of noncoding repeats lead to neuronal dysfunction responsible for myoclonic tremor and epilepsy extends the understanding of diseases with such repeat expansion.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
21983784,Deep resequencing of GWAS loci identifies independent rare variants associated with inflammatory bowel disease.,"More than 1,000 susceptibility loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common variants; however, the specific genes and full allelic spectrum of causal variants underlying these findings have not yet been defined. Here we used pooled next-generation sequencing to study 56 genes from regions associated with Crohn's disease in 350 cases and 350 controls. Through follow-up genotyping of 70 rare and low-frequency protein-altering variants in nine independent case-control series (16,054 Crohn's disease cases, 12,153 ulcerative colitis cases and 17,575 healthy controls), we identified four additional independent risk factors in NOD2, two additional protective variants in IL23R, a highly significant association with a protective splice variant in CARD9 (P < 1 × 10(-16), odds ratio ≈ 0.29) and additional associations with coding variants in IL18RAP, CUL2, C1orf106, PTPN22 and MUC19.

30032984,Mutations in PMFBP1 Cause Acephalic Spermatozoa Syndrome.,"Acephalic spermatozoa syndrome is a severe teratozoospermia that leads to male infertility. Our previous work showed that biallelic SUN5 mutations are responsible for acephalic spermatozoa syndrome in about half of affected individuals, while pathogenic mechanisms in the other individuals remain to be elucidated. Here, we identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in the testis-specific gene PMFBP1 using whole-exome sequencing in a consanguineous family with two infertile brothers with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome. Sanger sequencing of PMFBP1 in ten additional infertile men with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome and without SUN5 mutations revealed two homozygous variants and one compound heterozygous variant. The disruption of Pmfbp1 in male mice led to infertility due to the production of acephalic spermatozoa and the disruption of PMFBP1's cooperation with SUN5 and SPATA6, which plays a role in connecting sperm head to the tail. PMFBP1 mutation-associated male infertility could be successfully overcome by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in both mouse and human. Thus, mutations in PMFBP1 are an important cause of infertility in men with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"

IGDs cause a series of overlapping phenotypes consisting of seizures, dysmorphic features, multiple congenital malformations, and severe intellectual disability. We present a study of six individuals from three unrelated families in which WES or WGS identified bi-allelic phosphatidylinositol glycan class S (PIGS) biosynthesis mutations. Phenotypes included severe global developmental delay, seizures (partly responding to pyridoxine), hypotonia, weakness, ataxia, and dysmorphic facial features. Two of them had compound-heterozygous variants c.108G>A (p.Trp36∗) and c.101T>C (p.Leu34Pro), and two siblings of another family were homozygous for a deletion and insertion leading to p.Thr439_Lys451delinsArgLeuLeu. The third family had two fetuses with multiple joint contractures consistent with fetal akinesia. They were compound heterozygous for c.923A>G (p.Glu308Gly) and c.468+1G>C, a splicing mutation. Flow-cytometry analyses demonstrated that the individuals with PIGS mutations show a GPI-AP deficiency profile. Expression of the p.Trp36∗ variant in PIGS-deficient HEK293 cells revealed only partial restoration of cell-surface GPI-APs. In terms of both biochemistry and phenotype, loss of function of PIGS shares features with PIGT deficiency and other IGDs. This study contributes to the understanding of the GPI-AP biosynthesis pathway by describing the consequences of PIGS disruption in humans and extending the family of IGDs.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

We report three individuals with profound developmental delay, brain abnormalities, 2-3 syndactyly of the toes, and facial dysmorphisms, resembling Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, the most common cholesterol biogenesis defect. The metabolite profile in plasma and urine suggested that their defect was at the level of squalene synthase. Whole-exome sequencing was used to identify recessive disease-causing variants in FDFT1.

11232012,Three new mutations in the gene for the growth hormone (gh)-releasing hormone receptor in familial isolated gh deficiency type ib.,"Isolated GH deficiency (IGHD) is familial in 5-30% of cases. The majority of patients have the type IB form, characterized by autosomal recessive transmission, low but measurable serum concentrations of GH, and responsiveness to exogenous GH therapy. Unique mutations in the gene encoding the GHRH receptor (GHRHR) have previously been described in 2 kindreds with IGHD IB. However, the prevalence of GHRHR mutations in patients with IGHD IB is unknown. We analyzed 30 families with IGHD IB in which more than 1 member was affected. Linkage analysis was performed in 28 of the families, and in 3 families sibling pair analysis indicated linkage to the GHRHR gene locus. These 3 families as well as 2 families in which linkage analysis was not performed were screened for mutations in the 13 coding exons, the intron-exon boundaries, and 327 bases of the promoter of the GHRHR gene. We identified novel GHRHR missense mutations in 2 of the 3 kindreds with informative linkage and in 1 family in which linkage had not been performed. In 1 family affected members were homozygous for a mutation in codon 144 that replaces leucine with histidine (L144H). Affected subjects in a second family were compound heterozygotes, carrying both the L144H mutation and a second mutation in codon 242 that replaces phenylalanine with cysteine. Affected subjects in a third family were homozygous for a mutation that replaces alanine at codon 222 with glutamic acid. All 3 mutations segregated with the IGHD phenotype. All 3 mutant receptors were expressed in CHO cells, and each failed to show a cAMP response after treatment of the cells with GHRH. These results demonstrate that missense mutations in the GHRHR gene are a cause of IGHD IB, and that defects in the GHRHR gene may be a more common cause of GH deficiency than previously suspected.",research-article; journal article
30290153,"Activating Mutations in PAK1, Encoding p21-Activated Kinase 1, Cause a Neurodevelopmental Disorder.","p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases acting as effectors of CDC42 and RAC, which are members of the RHO family of small GTPases. PAK1's kinase activity is autoinhibited by homodimerization, whereas CDC42 or RAC1 binding causes PAK1 activation by dimer dissociation. Major functions of the PAKs include actin cytoskeleton reorganization, for example regulation of the cellular protruding activity during cell spreading. We report the de novo PAK1 mutations c.392A>G (p.Tyr131Cys) and c.1286A>G (p.Tyr429Cys) in two unrelated subjects with developmental delay, secondary macrocephaly, seizures, and ataxic gait. We identified enhanced phosphorylation of the PAK1 targets JNK and AKT in fibroblasts of one subject and of c-JUN in those of both subjects compared with control subjects. In fibroblasts of the two affected individuals, we observed a trend toward enhanced PAK1 kinase activity. By using co-immunoprecipitation and size-exclusion chromatography, we observed a significantly reduced dimerization for both PAK1 mutants compared with wild-type PAK1. These data demonstrate that the two PAK1 variants function as activating alleles. In a cell spreading assay, subject-derived fibroblasts showed significant enrichment in cells occupied by filopodia. Interestingly, application of the PAK1 inhibitor FRAX486 completely reversed this cellular phenotype. Together, our data reveal that dominantly acting, gain-of-function PAK1 mutations cause a neurodevelopmental phenotype with increased head circumference, possibly by a combined effect of defective homodimerization and enhanced kinase activity of PAK1. This condition, along with the developmental disorders associated with RAC1 and CDC42 missense mutations, highlight the importance of RHO GTPase members and effectors in neuronal development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
29909964,Neonatal-Onset Chronic Diarrhea Caused by Homozygous Nonsense WNT2B Mutations.,"Homozygous nonsense mutations in WNT2B were identified in three individuals from two unrelated families with severe, neonatal-onset osmotic diarrhea after whole-exome sequencing was performed on trios from the two families. Intestinal biopsy samples from affected individuals were used for histology and immunofluorescence and to generate enteroids ex vivo. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrated chronic inflammatory changes in the stomach, duodenum, and colon. Immunofluorescence demonstrated diminished staining for OLFM4, a marker for intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The enteroids generated from WNT2B-deficient intestinal epithelium could not be expanded and did not survive passage. Addition of CHIR-99021 (a GSK3A and GSK3B inhibitor and activator of canonical WNT/β-CATENIN signaling) could not rescue WNT2B-deficient enteroids. Addition of supplemental recombinant murine WNT2B was able to perpetuate small enteroids for multiple passages but failed to expand their number. Enteroids showed a 10-fold increase in the expression of LEF1 mRNA and a 100-fold reduction in TLR4 expression, compared with controls by quantitative RT-PCR, indicating alterations in canonical WNT and microbial pattern-recognition signaling. In summary, individuals with homozygous nonsense mutations in WNT2B demonstrate severe intestinal dysregulation associated with decreased ISC number and function, likely explaining their diarrheal phenotype. WNT2B deficiency should be considered for individuals with neonatal-onset diarrhea.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27640305,Biallelic SUN5 Mutations Cause Autosomal-Recessive Acephalic Spermatozoa Syndrome.,"Acephalic spermatozoa syndrome is a rare and severe form of teratozoospermia characterized by a predominance of headless spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Family clustering and consanguinity suggest a genetic origin; however, causative mutations have yet to be identified. We performed whole-exome sequencing in two unrelated infertile men and subsequent variant filtering identified one homozygous (c.824C>T [p.Thr275Met]) and one compound heterozygous (c.1006C>T [p.Arg356Cys] and c.485T>A [p.Met162Lys]) SUN5 (also named TSARG4) variants. Sanger sequencing of SUN5 in 15 additional unrelated infertile men revealed four compound heterozygous (c.381delA [p.Val128Serfs∗7] and c.824C>T [p.Thr275Met]; c.381delA [p.Val128Serfs∗7] and c.781G>A [p.Val261Met]; c.216G>A [p.Trp72∗] and c.1043A>T [p.Asn348Ile]; c.425+1G>A/c.1043A>T [p.Asn348Ile]) and two homozygous (c.851C>G [p.Ser284∗]; c.350G>A [p.Gly114Arg]) variants in six individuals. These 10 SUN5 variants were found in 8 of 17 unrelated men, explaining the genetic defect in 47.06% of the affected individuals in our cohort. These variants were absent in 100 fertile population-matched control individuals. SUN5 variants lead to absent, significantly reduced, or truncated SUN5, and certain variants altered SUN5 distribution in the head-tail junction of the sperm. In summary, these results demonstrate that biallelic SUN5 mutations cause male infertility due to autosomal-recessive acephalic spermatozoa syndrome.",brief-report; journal article
30449416,"Recurrent, Activating Variants in the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase DDR2 Cause Warburg-Cinotti Syndrome.","We have investigated a distinct disorder with progressive corneal neovascularization, keloid formation, chronic skin ulcers, wasting of subcutaneous tissue, flexion contractures of the fingers, and acro-osteolysis. In six affected individuals from four families, we found one of two recurrent variants in discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2): c.1829T>C (p.Leu610Pro) or c.2219A>G (p.Tyr740Cys). DDR2 encodes a collagen-responsive receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates connective-tissue formation. In three of the families, affected individuals comprise singleton adult individuals, and parental samples were not available for verification of the de novo occurrence of the DDR2 variants. In the fourth family, a mother and two of her children were affected, and the c.2219A>G missense variant was proven to be de novo in the mother. Phosphorylation of DDR2 was increased in fibroblasts from affected individuals, suggesting reduced receptor autoinhibition and ligand-independent kinase activation. Evidence for activation of other growth-regulatory signaling pathways was not found. Finally, we found that the protein kinase inhibitor dasatinib prevented DDR2 autophosphorylation in fibroblasts, suggesting an approach to treatment. We propose this progressive, fibrotic condition should be designated as Warburg-Cinotti syndrome.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
15883308,"The genetic causes of basal ganglia calcification, dementia, and bone cysts: DAP12 and TREM2.","BACKGROUND: Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL), or Nasu-Hakola disease, is a presenile dementia associated with loss of myelin, basal ganglia calcification, and bone cysts. It is caused by recessively inherited mutations in two genes encoding subunits of a cell membrane-associated receptor complex: TREM2 and DAP12. The clinical course of PLOSL has not been characterized in a series of patients with TREM2 mutations. METHODS: The authors compare neurologic and neuroradiologic follow-up data of six patients carrying TREM2 mutations with PLOSL due to defective DAP12 genes. The authors review the known mutations in these two genes. RESULTS: Mutations in DAP12 and TREM2 result in a uniform disease phenotype. In Finnish and Japanese patients with PLOSL, DAP12 mutations predominate, whereas TREM2 is mutated more frequently elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy should be considered in adult patients under age 50 years with dementia and basal ganglia calcification. Radiographs of ankles and wrists, and DNA test in uncertain cases, confirm the diagnosis.","comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
28364549,Deleterious variants in TRAK1 disrupt mitochondrial movement and cause fatal encephalopathy.,"Cellular distribution and dynamics of mitochondria are regulated by several motor proteins and a microtubule network. In neurons, mitochondrial trafficking is crucial because of high energy needs and calcium ion buffering along axons to synapses during neurotransmission. The trafficking kinesin proteins (TRAKs) are well characterized for their role in lysosomal and mitochondrial trafficking in cells, especially neurons. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified homozygous truncating variants in TRAK1 (NM_001042646:c.287-2A > C), in six lethal encephalopathic patients from three unrelated families. The pathogenic variant results in aberrant splicing and significantly reduced gene expression at the RNA and protein levels. In comparison with normal cells, TRAK1-deficient fibroblasts showed irregular mitochondrial distribution, altered mitochondrial motility, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and diminished mitochondrial respiration. This study confirms the role of TRAK1 in mitochondrial dynamics and constitutes the first report of this gene in association with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article"
30395363,FAM92A Underlies Nonsyndromic Postaxial Polydactyly in Humans and an Abnormal Limb and Digit Skeletal Phenotype in Mice.,"Polydactyly is a common congenital anomaly of the hand and foot. Postaxial polydactyly (PAP) is characterized by one or more posterior or postaxial digits. In a Pakistani family with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic postaxial polydactyly type A (PAPA), we performed genomewide genotyping, linkage analysis, and exome and Sanger sequencing. Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous nonsense variant (c.478C>T, p.[Arg160*]) in the FAM92A gene within the mapped region on 8q21.13-q24.12 that segregated with the PAPA phenotype. We found that FAM92A is expressed in the developing mouse limb and E11.5 limb bud including the progress zone and the apical ectodermal ridge, where it strongly localizes at the cilia level, suggesting an important role in limb patterning. The identified variant leads to a loss of the FAM92A/Chibby1 complex that is crucial for ciliogenesis and impairs the recruitment and the colocalization of FAM92A with Chibby1 at the base of the cilia. In addition, we show that Fam92a-/- homozygous mice also exhibit an abnormal digit morphology, including metatarsal osteomas and polysyndactyly, in addition to distinct abnormalities on the deltoid tuberosity of their humeri. In conclusion, we present a new nonsyndromic PAPA ciliopathy due to a loss-of-function variant in FAM92A.

27311568,Identification of C12orf4 as a gene for autosomal recessive intellectual disability.,"Intellectual disability (ID) is a major health problem in our society. Genetic causes of ID remain unknown because of its vast heterogeneity. Here we report two Finnish families and one Dutch family with affected individuals presenting with mild to moderate ID, neuropsychiatric symptoms and delayed speech development. By utilizing whole exome sequencing (WES), we identified a founder missense variant c.983T>C (p.Leu328Pro) in seven affected individuals from two Finnish consanguineous families and a deletion c.799_1034-429delinsTTATGA (p.Gln267fs) in one affected individual from a consanguineous Dutch family in the C12orf4 gene on chromosome 12. Both the variants co-segregated in the respective families as an autosomal recessive trait. Screening of the p.Leu328Pro variant showed enrichment in the North Eastern sub-isolate of Finland among anonymous local blood donors with a carrier frequency of 1:53, similar to other disease mutations with a founder effect in that region. To date, only one Arab family with a three affected individuals with a frameshift insertion variant in C12orf4 has been reported. In summary, we expand and establish the clinical and mutational spectrum of C12orf4 variants. Our findings implicate C12orf4 as a causative gene for autosomal recessive ID.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
25558065,Accelerating novel candidate gene discovery in neurogenetic disorders via whole-exome sequencing of prescreened multiplex consanguineous families.,"Our knowledge of disease genes in neurological disorders is incomplete. With the aim of closing this gap, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 143 multiplex consanguineous families in whom known disease genes had been excluded by autozygosity mapping and candidate gene analysis. This prescreening step led to the identification of 69 recessive genes not previously associated with disease, ofÂ which 33 are here described (SPDL1, TUBA3E, INO80, NID1, TSEN15, DMBX1, CLHC1, C12orf4, WDR93, ST7, MATN4, SEC24D, PCDHB4, PTPN23, TAF6, TBCK, FAM177A1, KIAA1109, MTSS1L, XIRP1, KCTD3, CHAF1B, ARV1, ISCA2, PTRH2, GEMIN4, MYOCD, PDPR, DPH1, NUP107, TMEM92, EPB41L4A, and FAM120AOS). We also encountered instances in which the phenotype departed significantly from the established clinical presentation of a known disease gene. Overall, a likely causal mutation was identified in >73% of our cases. This study contributes to the global effort toward a full compendium of disease genes affecting brain function.",research-article; journal article
28646613,Novel TMC8 splice site mutation in epidermodysplasia verruciformis and review of HPV infections in patients with the disease.,"Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a genodermatosis leading to infections with cutaneous HPV, persistent plane warts and a high rate of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in TMC6 and TMC8 are known to be causative.The aim of this study was to report EV-causing mutations in four patients with EV and to give an overview of all described patients with EV.We investigated four patients with classical features of EV from two families. All patients were affected by plane warts with typical EV histology since early childhood, and β-HPVs were detected on their skin. One patient had recurring cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC) and carcinomas in situ (Bowen type). We sequenced both TMC6/8 for disease-causing mutations and quantified levels of gene expression. We also performed a systematic literature review to discuss these patients in the context of previously reported cases, mutations already identified, as well as HPV types.Three patients of one family carried a homozygous splice site mutation in TMC8 resulting in aberrantly spliced transcripts that were not degraded. By contrast, no TMC6/8 mutation was detected in the patient from the other family. A systematic literature review revealed 501 described patients with EV. Around 40% of patients with EV analysed for genetic alterations carried no mutation in TMC6/8. While β-HPVs were identified in the majority of cases, α-HPVs were detected in several individuals.The relatively high proportion of EV patients without mutation in TMC6/8 indicates the existence of EV-causing mutations in additional, presently unknown gene(s). However, a homozygous TMC8 splice site mutation in our patients resulted in aberrant transcripts which cannot retain the healthy phenotype. The literature review revealed that HPV-5 is the most commonly identified HPV in patients with EV, but HPV-3, HPV-14 and HPV-20 were unexpectedly identified more frequently than HPV-8.",review; journal article; case reports
28945198,Mutations in the netrin-1 gene cause congenital mirror movements.,"Netrin-1 is a secreted protein that was first identified 20 years ago as an axon guidance molecule that regulates midline crossing in the CNS. It plays critical roles in various tissues throughout development and is implicated in tumorigenesis and inflammation in adulthood. Despite extensive studies, no inherited human disease has been directly associated with mutations in NTN1, the gene coding for netrin-1. Here, we have identified 3 mutations in exon 7 of NTN1 in 2 unrelated families and 1 sporadic case with isolated congenital mirror movements (CMM), a disorder characterized by involuntary movements of one hand that mirror intentional movements of the opposite hand. Given the diverse roles of netrin-1, the absence of manifestations other than CMM in NTN1 mutation carriers was unexpected. Using multimodal approaches, we discovered that the anatomy of the corticospinal tract (CST) is abnormal in patients with NTN1-mutant CMM. When expressed in HEK293 or stable HeLa cells, the 3 mutated netrin-1 proteins were almost exclusively detected in the intracellular compartment, contrary to WT netrin-1, which is detected in both intracellular and extracellular compartments. Since netrin-1 is a diffusible extracellular cue, the pathophysiology likely involves its loss of function and subsequent disruption of axon guidance, resulting in abnormal decussation of the CST.",research-article; journal article
28600438,Human RELA haploinsufficiency results in autosomal-dominant chronic mucocutaneous ulceration.,"The treatment of chronic mucocutaneous ulceration is challenging, and only some patients respond selectively to inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF). TNF activates opposing pathways leading to caspase-8-mediated apoptosis as well as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent cell survival. We investigated the etiology of autosomal-dominant, mucocutaneous ulceration in a family whose proband was dependent on anti-TNF therapy for sustained remission. A heterozygous mutation in RELA, encoding the NF-κB subunit RelA, segregated with the disease phenotype and resulted in RelA haploinsufficiency. The patients' fibroblasts exhibited increased apoptosis in response to TNF, impaired NF-κB activation, and defective expression of NF-κB-dependent antiapoptotic genes. Rela+/- mice have similarly impaired NF-κB activation, develop cutaneous ulceration from TNF exposure, and exhibit severe dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, ameliorated by TNF inhibition. These findings demonstrate an essential contribution of biallelic RELA expression in protecting stromal cells from TNF-mediated cell death, thus delineating the mechanisms driving the effectiveness of TNF inhibition in this disease.",research-article; journal article; case reports
28280134,Novel and known ribosomal causes of Diamond-Blackfan anaemia identified through comprehensive genomic characterisation.,"BACKGROUND:Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS) characterised by erythroid hypoplasia. It is associated with congenital anomalies and a high risk of developing specific cancers. DBA is caused predominantly by autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in at least 15 genes affecting ribosomal biogenesis and function. Two X-linked recessive genes have been identified. OBJECTIVES:We aim to identify the genetic aetiology of DBA. METHODS:Of 87 families with DBA enrolled in an institutional review board-approved cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT00027274), 61 had genetic testing information available. Thirty-five families did not have a known genetic cause and thus underwent comprehensive genomic evaluation with whole exome sequencing, deletion and CNV analyses to identify their disease-associated pathogenic variant. Controls for functional studies were healthy mutation-negative individuals enrolled in the same study. RESULTS:Our analyses uncovered heterozygous pathogenic variants in two previously undescribed genes in two families. One family had a non-synonymous variant (p.K77N) in RPL35; the second family had a non-synonymous variant (p. L51S) in RPL18. Both of these variants result in pre-rRNA processing defects. We identified heterozygous pathogenic variants in previously known DBA genes in 16 of 35 families. Seventeen families who underwent genetic analyses are yet to have a genetic cause of disease identified. CONCLUSIONS:Overall, heterozygous pathogenic variants in ribosomal genes were identified in 44 of the 61 families (72%). De novo pathogenic variants were observed in 57% of patients with DBA. Ongoing studies of DBA genomics will be important to understand this complex disorder.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; clinical trial; journal article"
29460469,Further delineation of an entity caused by CREBBP and EP300 mutations but not resembling Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.,"In 2016, we described that missense variants in parts of exons 30 and 31 of CREBBP can cause a phenotype that differs from Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS). Here we report on another 11 patients with variants in this region of CREBBP (between bp 5,128 and 5,614) and two with variants in the homologous region of EP300. None of the patients show characteristics typical for RSTS. The variants were detected by exome sequencing using a panel for intellectual disability in all but one individual, in whom Sanger sequencing was performed upon clinical recognition of the entity. The main characteristics of the patients are developmental delay (90%), autistic behavior (65%), short stature (42%), and microcephaly (43%). Medical problems include feeding problems (75%), vision (50%), and hearing (54%) impairments, recurrent upper airway infections (42%), and epilepsy (21%). Major malformations are less common except for cryptorchidism (46% of males), and cerebral anomalies (70%). Individuals with variants between bp 5,595 and 5,614 of CREBBP show a specific phenotype (ptosis, telecanthi, short and upslanted palpebral fissures, depressed nasal ridge, short nose, anteverted nares, short columella, and long philtrum). 3D face shape demonstrated resemblance to individuals with a duplication of 16p13.3 (the region that includes CREBBP), possibly indicating a gain of function. The other affected individuals show a less specific phenotype. We conclude that there is now more firm evidence that variants in these specific regions of CREBBP and EP300 result in a phenotype that differs from RSTS, and that this phenotype may be heterogeneous.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29726989,A splicing mutation in aryl hydrocarbon receptor associated with retinitis pigmentosa.,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) refers to a group of retinal degenerative diseases, which often lead to vision loss. Although 70 genes have been identified in RP patients, the genetic cause of approximately 30% of RP cases remains unknown. We aimed to identify the cause of the disease in a cohort of RP families by whole exome sequencing. A rare homozygous splicing variant, c.1160 + 1G>A, which introduced skipping of exon 9 of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), was identified in family RD-134. This variant is very rare in several exome databases and leads to skipping of exon 9 in the transcript. AHR is expressed in the human retina and is a ligand-activated transcription factor with multiple functions. Mutant AHR failed to promote 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-induced xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) luciferase activity. In parallel, mutation in AHR abolished activation of its downstream target gene, such as CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. To investigate the in vivo roles of Ahr in the retina, we generated a retina-specific conditional knockout mouse model of Ahr. Comparing with wild-type mouse, Ahr knockout mice exhibited reduced electroretinogram responses at 9 months of age. Retinal histology revealed retinal histology showed the degeneration of photoreceptors with a thinner outer nuclear layer. Thus, our data demonstrate that AHR is associated with RP.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29895852,ZP2 pathogenic variants cause in vitro fertilization failure and female infertility.,"PURPOSE:The oocyte-borne genetic causes leading to fertilization failure are largely unknown. We aimed to identify novel human pathogenic variants (PV) and genes causing fertilization failure. METHODS:We performed exome sequencing for a consanguineous family with a recessive inheritance pattern of female infertility characterized by oocytes with a thin zona pellucida (ZP) and fertilization failure in routine in vitro fertilization. Subsequent PV screening of ZP2 was performed in additional eight unrelated infertile women whose oocytes exhibited abnormal ZP and similar fertilization failure. Expression of ZP proteins was assessed in mutant oocytes by immunostaining, and functional studies of the wild-type and mutant proteins were carried out in CHO-K1 cells. RESULTS:Two homozygous s PV (c.1695-2A>G, and c.1691_1694dup (p.C566Wfs*5), respectively) of ZP2 were identified in the affected women from two unrelated consanguineous families. All oocytes carrying PV were surrounded by a thin ZP that was defective for sperm-binding. Immunostaining indicated a lack of ZP2 protein in the thin ZP. Studies in CHO cells showed that both PV resulted in a truncated ZP2 protein, which might be intracellularly sequestered and prematurely interacted with other ZP proteins. CONCLUSION:We identified loss-of-function PV of ZP2 causing a structurally abnormal and dysfunctional ZP, resulting in fertilization failure and female infertility.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29726066,Partial loss-of-function of sodium channel SCN8A in familial isolated myoclonus.,"Variants in the neuronal sodium channel gene SCN8A have been implicated in several neurological disorders. Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 13 results from de novo gain-of-function mutations that alter the biophysical properties of the channel. Complete loss-of-function variants of SCN8A have been identified in cases of isolated intellectual disability. We now report a novel heterozygous SCN8A variant, p.Pro1719Arg, in a small pedigree with five family members affected with autosomal dominant upper limb isolated myoclonus without seizures or cognitive impairment. Functional analysis of the p.Pro1719Arg variant in transfected neuron-derived cells demonstrated greatly reduced Nav 1.6 channel activity without altered gating properties. Hypomorphic alleles of Scn8a in the mouse are known to result in similar movement disorders. This study expands the phenotypic and functional spectrum of SCN8A variants to include inherited nonepileptic isolated myoclonus. SCN8A can be considered as a candidate gene for isolated movement disorders without seizures.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25102815,Bleeding diathesis and gastro-duodenal ulcers in inherited cytosolic phospholipase-A2 alpha deficiency.,"Arachidonic acid (AA), when cleaved from phospholipids by cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2a), generates eicosanoids, with pro-hemostatic, pro-inflammatory, vasoactive and gastro-protective functions. We describe a patient (27-year-old man) and his twin-sister with early-onset bleeding diathesis and recurrent gastro-intestinal (GI) ulcers. Platelet aggregation/δ-granules secretion by collagen was impaired, but normal by AA; serum levels of thromboxane (Tx) B2 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and urinary levels of 11-dehydro-TxB2 were extremely low. Patients were homozygous for 1723G>C transition in PLA2G4A gene, which changed the codon for Asp575 to His. GI ulcers affected 5/14 heterozygous (< 40 years) and 1/16 wild-type homozygous (> 60 years) family members; none had bleeding diathesis. The proband, his sister and mother also had mildly reduced factor XI levels. Platelet messenger RNA expression did not differ among subjects with different PLA2G4A genotypes. Conversely, platelet cPLA2a was undetectable by Western Blotting in the proband and his sister, and decreased in 1723G>C heterozygous subjects, suggesting that the variant is transcribed, but not translated or translated into an unstable protein. We described a syndromic form of deficiency of cPLA2a , characterised by recurrent GI ulcers and bleeding diathesis, associated with mild inherited deficiency of factor XI. Unlike other reported patients with cPLA2a deficiency, these patients had extremely low levels of platelet TxA2 biosynthesis.",twin study; journal article
18451993,"Inherited human cPLA(2alpha) deficiency is associated with impaired eicosanoid biosynthesis, small intestinal ulceration, and platelet dysfunction.","Cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha) hydrolyzes arachidonic acid from cellular membrane phospholipids, thereby providing enzymatic substrates for the synthesis of eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Considerable understanding of cPLA2alpha function has been derived from investigations of the enzyme and from cPLA2alpha-null mice, but knowledge of discrete roles for this enzyme in humans is limited. We investigated a patient hypothesized to have an inherited prostanoid biosynthesis deficiency due to his multiple, complicated small intestinal ulcers despite no use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Levels of thromboxane B2 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid produced by platelets and leukotriene B4 released from calcium ionophore-activated blood were markedly reduced, indicating defective enzymatic release of the arachidonic acid substrate for the corresponding cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases. Platelet aggregation and degranulation induced by adenosine diphosphate or collagen were diminished but were normal in response to arachidonic acid. Two heterozygous single base pair mutations and a known SNP were found in the coding regions of the patient's cPLA2alpha genes (p.[Ser111Pro]+[Arg485His; Lys651Arg]). The total PLA2 activity in sonicated platelets was diminished, and the urinary metabolites of prostacyclin, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin D2, and thromboxane A2 were also reduced. These findings characterize what we believe is a novel inherited deficiency of cPLA2.","research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
23268370,Cryptogenic multifocal ulcerating stenosing enteritis associated with homozygous deletion mutations in cytosolic phospholipase A2-α.,"Cryptogenic multifocal ulcerating stenosing enteritis (CMUSE) is an extremely rare, but devastating, disease of unknown aetiology. We investigated the genetic basis of this autosomal recessive condition in a pair of affected siblings who have 40-year histories of catastrophic gastrointestinal and extraintestinal disease.Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism homozygosity mapping in the two affected family members combined with whole-exome sequencing of one affected sibling. This was followed by confirmatory Sanger sequencing of the likely disease-causing sequence variant and functional studies in affected and unaffected family members.Insertion/deletion variation analysis revealed the presence of a homozygous 4 bp deletion (g.155574_77delGTAA) in the PLA2G4A gene, located in the splice donor site directly after exon 17 (the penultimate exon) of the gene in both affected siblings. This introduces a frameshift of 10 amino acids before a premature stop codon (p.V707fsX10), which is predicted to result in the loss of 43 amino acids (residues 707-749) at the C-terminus of cytosolic phospholipase A2-α (cPLA(2)α). cPLA(2)α protein expression was undetectable in the gut of both siblings, with platelet aggregation and thromboxane A(2) production, as functional assays for cPLA(2)α activity, grossly impaired.We have identified mutations in PLA2G4A as a cause of CMUSE in two affected siblings. Further studies are needed to determine if mutations in this gene are also responsible for disease of a similar phenotype in other cases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
30506946,Mutations in RELT cause autosomal recessive amelogenesis imperfecta.,"Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a collection of isolated (non-syndromic) inherited diseases affecting dental enamel formation or a clinical phenotype in syndromic conditions. We characterized three consanguineous AI families with generalized irregular hypoplastic enamel with rapid attrition that perfectly segregated with homozygous defects in a novel gene: RELT that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). RNAscope in situ hybridization of wild-type mouse molars and incisors showed specific Relt mRNA expression by secretory stage ameloblasts and by odontoblasts. Relt-/- mice generated by CRISPR/Cas9 exhibited incisor and molar enamel malformations. Relt-/- enamel had a rough surface and underwent rapid attrition. Normally unmineralized spaces in the deep enamel near the dentino-enamel junction (DEJ) were as highly mineralized as the adjacent enamel, which likely altered the mechanical properties of the DEJ. Phylogenetic analyses showed the existence of selective pressure on RELT gene outside of tooth development, indicating that the human condition may be syndromic, which possibly explains the history of small stature and severe childhood infections in two of the probands. Knowing a TNFRSF member is critical during the secretory stage of enamel formation advances our understanding of amelogenesis and improves our ability to diagnose human conditions featuring enamel malformations.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; multicenter study; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
19261599,Germline mutation in DOK7 associated with fetal akinesia deformation sequence.,"Fetal akinesia deformation sequence syndrome (FADS) is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by fetal akinesia and developmental defects including, in some case, pterygia. Multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS) are traditionally divided into prenatally lethal and non-lethal (such as Escobar) types. Previously, we and others reported that homozygous mutations in the fetal acetylcholine receptor gamma subunit (CHRNG) can cause both lethal and non-lethal MPS, demonstrating that pterygia resulted from fetal akinesia, and that mutations in the acetylcholine receptor subunits CHRNA1, CHRND, and Rapsyn (RAPSN) can also result in a MPS/FADS phenotype.We hypothesised that mutations in other acetylcholine receptor related genes may interfere with neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction and so we analysed 14 cases of lethal MPS/FADS without CHRNG, CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, or RAPSN mutations for mutations in DOK7.A homozygous DOK7 splice site mutation, c.331+1G>T, was identified in a family with three children affected with lethal FADS. Previously DOK7 mutations have been reported to underlie a congenital myaesthenic syndrome with a characteristic ""limb girdle"" pattern of muscle weakness.This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that whereas incomplete loss of DOK7 function may cause congenital myasthenia, more severe loss of function can result in a lethal fetal akinesia phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
30298599,MPV17 mutations in juvenile- and adult-onset axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy.,"MPV17 encodes a putative channel-forming protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is involved in mitochondrial deoxynucleotide homeostasis. MPV17 mutations were first reported in patients with Navajo neurohepatopathy, an autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, characterized by early-onset liver failure, failure to thrive as well as central and peripheral neurological involvement. Recently, two patients with juvenile-onset peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy associated with an MVP17 c.122G>A (p.Arg41Gln) variant have been reported. Here, we describe five additional patients from two unrelated families with sensorimotor axonal neuropathy without hepatocerebral affection caused by homozygous MPV17 variants. Patients of the first family carried the known c.122G>A variant and affected individuals of the second family had a novel c.376-9T>G near-splice variant, which was shown to result in an in-frame deletion of 11 amino acids. This report provides further evidence that MPV17 mutations should be considered in patients with pure, non-syndromic axonal neuropathy.",journal article
30620337,Loss of the sphingolipid desaturase DEGS1 causes hypomyelinating leukodystrophy.,"Sphingolipid imbalance is the culprit in a variety of neurological diseases, some affecting the myelin sheath. We have used whole-exome sequencing in patients with undetermined leukoencephalopathies to uncover the endoplasmic reticulum lipid desaturase DEGS1 as the causative gene in 19 patients from 13 unrelated families. Shared features among the cases include severe motor arrest, early nystagmus, dystonia, spasticity, and profound failure to thrive. MRI showed hypomyelination, thinning of the corpus callosum, and progressive thalamic and cerebellar atrophy, suggesting a critical role of DEGS1 in myelin development and maintenance. This enzyme converts dihydroceramide (DhCer) into ceramide (Cer) in the final step of the de novo biosynthesis pathway. We detected a marked increase of the substrate DhCer and DhCer/Cer ratios in patients' fibroblasts and muscle. Further, we used a knockdown approach for disease modeling in Danio rerio, followed by a preclinical test with the first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis, fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya). The enzymatic inhibition of Cer synthase by fingolimod, 1 step prior to DEGS1 in the pathway, reduced the critical DhCer/Cer imbalance and the severe locomotor disability, increasing the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes in a zebrafish model. These proof-of-concept results pave the way to clinical translation.","video-audio media; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
12646665,Clinical spectrum of obesity and mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor gene.,"Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) deficiency is the commonest monogenic form of obesity. However, the clinical spectrum and mode of inheritance have not been defined, pathophysiological mechanisms leading to obesity are poorly understood, and there is little information regarding genotype-phenotype correlations.We determined the nucleotide sequence of the MC4R gene in 500 probands with severe childhood obesity. Family studies were undertaken to examine cosegregation of identified mutations with obesity. Subjects with MC4R deficiency underwent metabolic and endocrine evaluation; the results were correlated with the signaling properties of mutant receptors.Twenty-nine probands (5.8 percent) had mutations in MC4R; 23 were heterozygous, and 6 were homozygous. Mutation carriers had severe obesity, increased lean mass, increased linear growth, hyperphagia, and severe hyperinsulinemia; homozygotes were more severely affected than heterozygotes. Subjects with mutations retaining residual signaling capacity had a less severe phenotype.Mutations in MC4R result in a distinct obesity syndrome that is inherited in a codominant manner.

29703829,"Old gene, new phenotype: splice-altering variants in CEACAM16 cause recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment.","BACKGROUND:Hearing loss is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this study was to determine the genetic cause underlying the postlingual progressive hearing loss in two Iranian families. METHODS:We used OtoSCOPE, a next-generation sequencing platform targeting >150 genes causally linked to deafness, to screen two deaf probands. Data analysis was completed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline, and variants were functionally assessed using minigene splicing assays. RESULTS:We identified two homozygous splice-altering variants (c.37G>Tâ€‰and c.662-1G>C) in the CEACAM16 gene, segregating with the deafness in each family. The minigene splicing results revealed the c.37G>T results in complete skipping of exon 2 and loss of the AUG start site. The c.662-1G>C activates a cryptic splice site inside exon 5 resulting in a shift in the mRNA reading frame. CONCLUSIONS:These results suggest that loss-of-function mutations in CEACAM16 result in postlingual progressive hearing impairment and further support the role of CEACAM16 in auditory function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30893644,"PPP2R3C gene variants cause syndromic 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis and impaired spermatogenesis in humans.","Context Most of the knowledge on the factors involved in human sexual development stems from studies of rare cases with disorders of sex development. Here, we have described a novel 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis syndrome caused by homozygous variants in PPP2R3C gene. This gene encodes Bâ€³gamma regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the phospho-regulation processes of most mammalian cell types. PPP2R3C gene is most abundantly expressed in testis in humans, while its function was hitherto unknown. Patients and methods Four girls from four unrelated families with 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis were studied using exome or Sanger sequencing of PPP2R3C gene. In total, four patients and their heterozygous parents were investigated for clinical, laboratory, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics. Results We have identified three different homozygous PPP2R3C variants, c.308T>C (p.L103P), c.578T>C (p.L193S) and c.1049T>C (p.F350S), in four girls with 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis. Patients also manifested a unique syndrome of extragonadal anomalies, including typical facial gestalt, low birth weight, myopathy, rod and cone dystrophy, anal atresia, omphalocele, sensorineural hearing loss, dry and scaly skin, skeletal abnormalities, renal agenesis and neuromotor delay. We have shown a decreased SOX9-Phospho protein expression in the dysgenetic gonads of the patients with homozygous PPP2R3C variants suggesting impaired SOX9 signaling in the pathogenesis of gonadal dysgenesis. Heterozygous males presented with abnormal sperm morphology and impaired fertility. Conclusion Our findings suggest that PPP2R3C protein is involved in the ontogeny of multiple organs, especially critical for testis development and spermatogenesis. PPPR3C provides insight into pathophysiology, as well as emerging as a potential therapeutic target for male infertility.",journal article; case reports
29590114,Mutations in Diphosphoinositol-Pentakisphosphate Kinase PPIP5K2 are associated with hearing loss in human and mouse.,"Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Here, we report a severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss locus, DFNB100 on chromosome 5q13.2-q23.2. Exome enrichment followed by massive parallel sequencing revealed a c.2510G>A transition variant in PPIP5K2 that segregated with DFNB100-associated hearing loss in two large apparently unrelated Pakistani families. PPIP5Ks enzymes interconvert 5-IP7 and IP8, two key members of the inositol pyrophosphate (PP-IP) cell-signaling family. Their actions at the interface of cell signaling and bioenergetic homeostasis can impact many biological processes. The c.2510G>A transition variant is predicted to substitute a highly invariant arginine residue with histidine (p.Arg837His) in the phosphatase domain of PPIP5K2. Biochemical studies revealed that the p.Arg837His variant reduces the phosphatase activity of PPIP5K2 and elevates its kinase activity. We found that in mouse inner ear, PPIP5K2 is expressed in the cochlear and vestibular sensory hair cells, supporting cells and spiral ganglion neurons. Mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of the Ppip5k2 phosphatase domain exhibit degeneration of cochlear outer hair cells and elevated hearing thresholds. Our demonstration that PPIP5K2 has a role in hearing in humans indicates that PP-IP signaling is important to hair cell maintenance and function within inner ear.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
30388401,Causative Mutations and Mechanism of Androgenetic Hydatidiform Moles.,"Androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles are human pregnancies with no embryos and affect 1 in every 1,400 pregnancies. They have mostly androgenetic monospermic genomes with all the chromosomes originating from a haploid sperm and no maternal chromosomes. Androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles were described in 1977, but how they occur has remained an open question. We identified bi-allelic deleterious mutations in MEI1, TOP6BL/C11orf80, and REC114, with roles in meiotic double-strand breaks formation in women with recurrent androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles. We investigated the occurrence of androgenesis in Mei1-deficient female mice and discovered that 8% of their oocytes lose all their chromosomes by extruding them with the spindles into the first polar body. We demonstrate that Mei1-/- oocytes are capable of fertilization and 5% produce androgenetic zygotes. Thus, we uncover a meiotic abnormality in mammals and a mechanism for the genesis of androgenetic zygotes that is the extrusion of all maternal chromosomes and their spindles into the first polar body.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30686508,Bi-allelic Mutations in ARMC2 Lead to Severe Astheno-Teratozoospermia Due to Sperm Flagellum Malformations in Humans and Mice.,"Male infertility is a major health concern. Among its different causes, multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) induces asthenozoospermia and is one of the most severe forms of qualitative sperm defects. Sperm of affected men display short, coiled, absent, and/or irregular flagella. To date, six genes (DNAH1, CFAP43, CFAP44, CFAP69, FSIP2, and WDR66) have been found to be recurrently associated with MMAF, but more than half of the cases analyzed remain unresolved, suggesting that many yet-uncharacterized gene defects account for this phenotype. Here, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 168 infertile men who had a typical MMAF phenotype. Five unrelated affected individuals carried a homozygous deleterious mutation in ARMC2, a gene not previously linked to the MMAF phenotype. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, we generated homozygous Armc2 mutant mice, which also presented an MMAF phenotype, thus confirming the involvement of ARMC2 in human MMAF. Immunostaining experiments in AMRC2-mutated individuals and mutant mice evidenced the absence of the axonemal central pair complex (CPC) proteins SPAG6 and SPEF2, whereas the other tested axonemal and peri-axonemal components were present, suggesting that ARMC2 is involved in CPC assembly and/or stability. Overall, we showed that bi-allelic mutations in ARMC2 cause male infertility in humans and mice by inducing a typical MMAF phenotype, indicating that this gene is necessary for sperm flagellum structure and assembly.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
25807530,"Mutations of human NARS2, encoding the mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, cause nonsyndromic deafness and Leigh syndrome.","Here we demonstrate association of variants in the mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase NARS2 with human hearing loss and Leigh syndrome. A homozygous missense mutation ([c.637G>T; p.Val213Phe]) is the underlying cause of nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB94) and compound heterozygous mutations ([c.969T>A; p.Tyr323*] + [c.1142A>G; p.Asn381Ser]) result in mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency and Leigh syndrome, which is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by symmetric, bilateral lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem. The severity of the genetic lesions and their effects on NARS2 protein structure cosegregate with the phenotype. A hypothetical truncated NARS2 protein, secondary to the Leigh syndrome mutation p.Tyr323* is not detectable and p.Asn381Ser further decreases NARS2 protein levels in patient fibroblasts. p.Asn381Ser also disrupts dimerization of NARS2, while the hearing loss p.Val213Phe variant has no effect on NARS2 oligomerization. Additionally we demonstrate decreased steady-state levels of mt-tRNAAsn in fibroblasts from the Leigh syndrome patients. In these cells we show that a decrease in oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and electron transport chain (ETC) activity can be rescued by overexpression of wild type NARS2. However, overexpression of the hearing loss associated p.Val213Phe mutant protein in these fibroblasts cannot complement the OCR and ETC defects. Our findings establish lesions in NARS2 as a new cause for nonsyndromic hearing loss and Leigh syndrome.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29410512,Clinical and molecular characteristics of newly reported mitochondrial disease entity caused by biallelic PARS2 mutations.,"Most of the 19 mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-aaRSs) involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis are already linked to specific entities, one of the exceptions being PARS2 mutations for which pathogenic significance is not finally validated. The aim of the study was to characterize the PARS2- related phenotype.Three siblings with biallelic PARS2 mutations presented from birth with infantile spasms, secondary microcephaly, and similar facial dysmorphy. Mental development was deeply impaired with speech absence and no eye contact. A dilated cardiomyopathy and multiorgan failure developed in childhood at the terminal stage, together with mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by valproate administration.Brain MRI showed progressive volume loss of the frontal lobes, both cortical and subcortical, with widening of the cortical sulci and frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and progressive demyelination were additional findings. Similar brain features were seen in three already reported PARS2 patients and seemed specific for this defect when compared with other mt-aaRSs defects (DARS2, EARS2, IARS2, and RARS2).Striking resemblance of the phenotype and Alpers-like brain MRI changes with predominance of frontal cerebral volume loss (FCVL-AS) in six patients from three families of different ethnicity with PARS2 mutations, justifies to distinguish the condition as a new disease entity.",journal article; case reports
31034465,"Mutations in PIK3C2A cause syndromic short stature, skeletal abnormalities, and cataracts associated with ciliary dysfunction.","PIK3C2A is a class II member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family that catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) into PI(3)P and the phosphorylation of PI(4)P into PI(3,4)P2. At the cellular level, PIK3C2A is critical for the formation of cilia and for receptor mediated endocytosis, among other biological functions. We identified homozygous loss-of-function mutations in PIK3C2A in children from three independent consanguineous families with short stature, coarse facial features, cataracts with secondary glaucoma, multiple skeletal abnormalities, neurological manifestations, among other findings. Cellular studies of patient-derived fibroblasts found that they lacked PIK3C2A protein, had impaired cilia formation and function, and demonstrated reduced proliferative capacity. Collectively, the genetic and molecular data implicate mutations in PIK3C2A in a new Mendelian disorder of PI metabolism, thereby shedding light on the critical role of a class II PI3K in growth, vision, skeletal formation and neurological development. In particular, the considerable phenotypic overlap, yet distinct features, between this syndrome and Lowe's syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the PI-5-phosphatase OCRL, highlight the key role of PI metabolizing enzymes in specific developmental processes and demonstrate the unique non-redundant functions of each enzyme. This discovery expands what is known about disorders of PI metabolism and helps unravel the role of PIK3C2A and class II PI3Ks in health and disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
30665704,Lack of GAS2L2 Causes PCD by Impairing Cilia Orientation and Mucociliary Clearance.,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disorder in which impaired ciliary function leads to chronic airway disease. Exome sequencing of a PCD subject identified an apparent homozygous frameshift variant, c.887_890delTAAG (p.Val296Glyfs∗13), in exon 5; this frameshift introduces a stop codon in amino acid 308 of the growth arrest-specific protein 2-like 2 (GAS2L2). Further genetic screening of unrelated PCD subjects identified a second proband with a compound heterozygous variant carrying the identical frameshift variant and a large deletion (c.867_∗343+1207del; p.?) starting in exon 5. Both individuals had clinical features of PCD but normal ciliary axoneme structure. In this research, using human nasal cells, mouse models, and X.laevis embryos, we show that GAS2L2 is abundant at the apical surface of ciliated cells, where it localizes with basal bodies, basal feet, rootlets, and actin filaments. Cultured GAS2L2-deficient nasal epithelial cells from one of the affected individuals showed defects in ciliary orientation and had an asynchronous and hyperkinetic (GAS2L2-deficient = 19.8 Hz versus control = 15.8 Hz) ciliary-beat pattern. These results were recapitulated in Gas2l2-/- mouse tracheal epithelial cell (mTEC) cultures and in X. laevis embryos treated with Gas2l2 morpholinos. In mice, the absence of Gas2l2 caused neonatal death, and the conditional deletion of Gas2l2 impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) and led to mucus accumulation. These results show that a pathogenic variant in GAS2L2 causes a genetic defect in ciliary orientation and impairs MCC and results in PCD.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
30968111,"A mutation in the major autophagy gene, WIPI2, associated with global developmental abnormalities.","We describe a large consanguineous pedigree from a remote area of Northern Pakistan, with a complex developmental disorder associated with wide-ranging symptoms, including mental retardation, speech and language impairment and other neurological, psychiatric, skeletal and cardiac abnormalities. We initially carried out a genetic study using the HumanCytoSNP-12 v2.1 Illumina gene chip on nine family members and identified a single region of homozygosity shared amongst four affected individuals on chromosome 7p22 (positions 3059377-5478971). We performed whole-exome sequencing on two affected individuals from two separate branches of the extended pedigree and identified a novel nonsynonymous homozygous mutation in exon 9 of the WIPI2 (WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositide 2) gene at position 5265458 (c.G745A;pV249M). WIPI2 plays a critical role in autophagy, an evolutionary conserved cellular pathway implicated in a growing number of medical conditions. The mutation is situated in a highly conserved and critically important region of WIPI2, responsible for binding PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2, an essential requirement for autophagy to proceed. The mutation is absent in all public databases, is predicted to be damaging and segregates with the disease phenotype. We performed functional studies in vitro to determine the potential effects of the mutation on downstream pathways leading to autophagosome assembly. Binding of the V231M mutant of WIPI2b to ATG16L1 (as well as ATG5-12) is significantly reduced in GFP pull-down experiments, and fibroblasts derived from the patients show reduced WIPI2 puncta, reduced LC3 lipidation and reduced autophagic flux.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30610177,"Dysfunction of GRAP, encoding the GRB2-related adaptor protein, is linked to sensorineural hearing loss.","We have identified a GRAP variant (c.311A>T; p.Gln104Leu) cosegregating with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness in two unrelated families. GRAP encodes a member of the highly conserved growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2)/Sem-5/drk family of proteins, which are involved in Ras signaling; however, the function of the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2)-related adaptor protein (GRAP) in the auditory system is not known. Here, we show that, in mouse, Grap is expressed in the inner ear and the protein localizes to the neuronal fibers innervating cochlear and utricular auditory hair cells. Downstream of receptor kinase (drk), the Drosophila homolog of human GRAP, is expressed in Johnston's organ (JO), the fly hearing organ, and the loss of drk in JO causes scolopidium abnormalities. drk mutant flies present deficits in negative geotaxis behavior, which can be suppressed by human wild-type but not mutant GRAP. Furthermore, drk specifically colocalizes with synapsin at synapses, suggesting a potential role of such adaptor proteins in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics in the nervous system. Our findings establish a causative link between GRAP mutation and nonsyndromic deafness and suggest a function of GRAP/drk in hearing.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
30213874,A mutation of the human EPHB2 gene leads to a major platelet functional defect.,"The ephrin transmembrane receptor family of tyrosine kinases is involved in platelet function. We report the first EPHB2 variant affecting platelets in 2 siblings (P1 and P2) from a consanguineous family with recurrent bleeding and normal platelet counts. Whole-exome sequencing identified a c.2233C>T variant (missense p.R745C) of the EPHB2 gene. P1 and P2 were homozygous for this variant, while their asymptomatic parents were heterozygous. The p.R745C variant within the tyrosine kinase domain was associated with defects in platelet aggregation, αIIbβ3 activation, and granule secretion induced by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists and convulxin, as well as in thrombus formation on collagen under flow. In contrast, clot retraction, flow-dependent platelet adhesion, and spreading on fibrinogen were only mildly affected, indicating limited effects on αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. Most importantly, Lyn, Syk, and FcRγ phosphorylation, the initial steps in glycoprotein VI (GPVI) platelet signaling were drastically impaired in the absence of platelet-platelet contact, indicating a positive role for EPHB2 in GPVI activation. Likewise platelet activation by PAR4-AP showed defective Src activation, as opposed to normal protein kinase C activity and Ca2+ mobilization. Overexpression of wild-type and R745C EPHB2 variant in RBL-2H3 (rat basophilic leukemia) cells stably expressing human GPVI confirmed that EPHB2 R745C mutation impaired EPHB2 autophosphorylation but had no effect on ephrin ligand-induced EPHB2 clustering, suggesting it did not interfere with EPHB2-ephrin-mediated cell-to-cell contact. In conclusion, this novel inherited platelet disorder affecting EPHB2 demonstrates this tyrosine kinase receptor plays an important role in platelet function through crosstalk with GPVI and GPCR signaling.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29431636,Germline Mutations in the Mitochondrial 2-Oxoglutarate/Malate Carrier SLC25A11 Gene Confer a Predisposition to Metastatic Paragangliomas.,"Comprehensive genetic analyses have identified germline SDHB and FH gene mutations as predominant causes of metastatic paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. However, some suspicious cases remain unexplained. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of a paraganglioma exhibiting an SDHx-like molecular profile in the absence of SDHx or FH mutations and identified a germline mutation in the SLC25A11 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier. Germline SLC25A11 mutations were identified in six other patients, five of whom had metastatic disease. These mutations were associated with loss of heterozygosity, suggesting that SLC25A11 acts as a tumor-suppressor gene. Pseudohypoxic and hypermethylator phenotypes comparable with those described in SDHx- and FH-related tumors were observed both in tumors with mutated SLC25A11 and in Slc25a11Δ/Δ immortalized mouse chromaffin knockout cells generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. These data show that SLC25A11 is a novel paraganglioma susceptibility gene for which loss of function correlates with metastatic presentation.Significance: A gene encoding a mitochondrial carrier is implicated in a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome, expanding the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in paraganglioma.

31031012,Mutations in ACTL6B Cause Neurodevelopmental Deficits and Epilepsy and Lead to Loss of Dendrites in Human Neurons.,"We identified individuals with variations in ACTL6B, a component of the chromatin remodeling machinery including the BAF complex. Ten individuals harbored bi-allelic mutations and presented with global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, and spasticity, and ten individuals with de novo heterozygous mutations displayed intellectual disability, ambulation deficits, severe language impairment, hypotonia, Rett-like stereotypies, and minor facial dysmorphisms (wide mouth, diastema, bulbous nose). Nine of these ten unrelated individuals had the identical de novo c.1027G>A (p.Gly343Arg) mutation. Human-derived neurons were generated that recaptured ACTL6B expression patterns in development from progenitor cell to post-mitotic neuron, validating the use of this model. Engineered knock-out of ACTL6B in wild-type human neurons resulted in profound deficits in dendrite development, a result recapitulated in two individuals with different bi-allelic mutations, and reversed on clonal genetic repair or exogenous expression of ACTL6B. Whole-transcriptome analyses and whole-genomic profiling of the BAF complex in wild-type and bi-allelic mutant ACTL6B neural progenitor cells and neurons revealed increased genomic binding of the BAF complex in ACTL6B mutants, with corresponding transcriptional changes in several genes including TPPP and FSCN1, suggesting that altered regulation of some cytoskeletal genes contribute to altered dendrite development. Assessment of bi-alleic and heterozygous ACTL6B mutations on an ACTL6B knock-out human background demonstrated that bi-allelic mutations mimic engineered deletion deficits while heterozygous mutations do not, suggesting that the former are loss of function and the latter are gain of function. These results reveal a role for ACTL6B in neurodevelopment and implicate another component of chromatin remodeling machinery in brain disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
29805041,Recessive Spondylocarpotarsal Synostosis Syndrome Due to Compound Heterozygosity for Variants in MYH3.,"Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome (SCTS) is characterized by intervertebral fusions and fusion of the carpal and tarsal bones. Biallelic mutations in FLNB cause this condition in some families, whereas monoallelic variants in MYH3, encoding embryonic heavy chain myosin 3, have been implicated in dominantly inherited forms of the disorder. Here, five individuals without FLNB mutations from three families were hypothesized to be affected by recessive SCTS on account of sibling recurrence of the phenotype. Initial whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed that all five were heterozygous for one of two independent splice-site variants in MYH3. Despite evidence indicating that three of the five individuals shared two allelic haplotypes encompassing MYH3, no second variant could be located in the WES datasets. Subsequent genome sequencing of these three individuals demonstrated a variant altering a 5' UTR splice donor site (rs557849165 in MYH3) not represented by exome-capture platforms. When the cohort was expanded to 16 SCTS-affected individuals without FLNB mutations, nine had truncating mutations transmitted by unaffected parents, and six inherited the rs557849165 variant in trans, an observation at odds with the population allele frequency for this variant. The rs557849165 variant disrupts splicing in the 5' UTR but is still permissive of MYH3 translational initiation, albeit with reduced efficiency. Although some MYH3 variants cause dominant SCTS, these data indicate that others (notably truncating variants) do not, except in the context of compound heterozygosity for a second hypomorphic allele. These observations make genetic diagnosis challenging in the context of simplex presentations of the disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30847922,Functional disruption of pyrimidine nucleoside transporter CNT1 results in a novel inborn error of metabolism with high excretion of uridine and cytidine.,"Genetic defects in the pyrimidine nucleoside transporters of the CNT transporter family have not yet been reported. Metabolic investigations in a patient with infantile afebrile tonic-clonic seizures revealed increased urinary uridine and cytidine excretion. Segregation of this metabolic trait in the family showed the same biochemical phenotype in a healthy older brother of the index. Whole exome sequencing revealed biallelic mutations in SLC28A1 encoding the pyrimidine nucleoside transporter CNT1 in the index and his brother. Both parents and unaffected sibs showed the variant in heterozygous state. The transporter is expressed in the kidneys. Compelling evidence is available for the disrupting effect of the mutation on the transport function thus explaining the increased excretion of the pyrimidine nucleosides. The exome analysis also revealed a pathogenic mutation in PRRT2 in the index, explaining the epilepsy phenotype in infancy. At present, both the index (10 years) and his older brother are asymptomatic. Mutations in SLC28A1 cause a novel inborn error of metabolism that can be explained by the disrupted activity of the pyrimidine nucleoside transporter CNT1. This is the first report describing a defect in the family of CNT concentrative pyrimidine nucleoside transporter proteins encoded by the SLC28 gene family. In all likelihood, the epilepsy phenotype in the index is unrelated to the SLC28A1 defect, as this can be fully explained by the pathogenic PRRT2 variant. Clinical data on more patients are required to prove whether pathogenic mutations in SLC28A1 have any clinical consequences or are to be considered a benign metabolic phenotype.","journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

Many genes responsible for ARNSHL have been identified or mapped. We previously mapped an ARNSHL locus at 17q12, herein designated DFNB99, in a consanguineous Chinese family. In this study, whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous missense mutation (c.1259G>A, p.Arg420Gln) in the gene-encoding transmembrane protein 132E (TMEM132E) as the causative variant. Immunofluorescence staining of the Organ of Corti showed Tmem132e highly expressed in murine inner hair cells. Furthermore, knockdown of the tmem132e ortholog in zebrafish affected the mechanotransduction of hair cells. Finally, wild-type human TMEM132E mRNA, but not the mRNA carrying the c.1259G>A mutation rescued the Tmem132e knockdown phenotype. We conclude that the variant in TMEM132E is the most likely cause of DFNB99.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
30351409,HCN1 mutation spectrum: from neonatal epileptic encephalopathy to benign generalized epilepsy and beyond.,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels control neuronal excitability and their dysfunction has been linked to epileptogenesis but few individuals with neurological disorders related to variants altering HCN channels have been reported so far. In 2014, we described five individuals with epileptic encephalopathy due to de novo HCN1 variants. To delineate HCN1-related disorders and investigate genotype-phenotype correlations further, we assembled a cohort of 33 unpublished patients with novel pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants: 19 probands carrying 14 different de novo mutations and four families with dominantly inherited variants segregating with epilepsy in 14 individuals, but not penetrant in six additional individuals. Sporadic patients had epilepsy with median onset at age 7 months and in 36% the first seizure occurred during a febrile illness. Overall, considering familial and sporadic patients, the predominant phenotypes were mild, including genetic generalized epilepsies and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) spectrum. About 20% manifested neonatal/infantile onset otherwise unclassified epileptic encephalopathy. The study also included eight patients with variants of unknown significance: one adopted patient had two HCN1 variants, four probands had intellectual disability without seizures, and three individuals had missense variants inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Of the 18 novel pathogenic missense variants identified, 12 were associated with severe phenotypes and clustered within or close to transmembrane domains, while variants segregating with milder phenotypes were located outside transmembrane domains, in the intracellular N- and C-terminal parts of the channel. Five recurrent variants were associated with similar phenotypes. Using whole-cell patch-clamp, we showed that the impact of 12 selected variants ranged from complete loss-of-function to significant shifts in activation kinetics and/or voltage dependence. Functional analysis of three different substitutions altering Gly391 revealed that these variants had different consequences on channel biophysical properties. The Gly391Asp variant, associated with the most severe, neonatal phenotype, also had the most severe impact on channel function. Molecular dynamics simulation on channel structure showed that homotetramers were not conducting ions because the permeation path was blocked by cation(s) strongly complexed to the Asp residue, whereas heterotetramers showed an instantaneous current component possibly linked to deformation of the channel pore. In conclusion, our results considerably expand the clinical spectrum related to HCN1 variants to include common generalized epilepsy phenotypes and further illustrate how HCN1 has a pivotal function in brain development and control of neuronal excitability.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31079899,"Bi-allelic Variants in DYNC1I2 Cause Syndromic Microcephaly with Intellectual Disability, Cerebral Malformations, and Dysmorphic Facial Features.","Cargo transport along the cytoplasmic microtubular network is essential for neuronal function, and cytoplasmic dynein-1 is an established molecular motor that is critical for neurogenesis and homeostasis. We performed whole-exome sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and chromosomal microarray studies in five individuals from three independent pedigrees and identified likely-pathogenic variants in DYNC1I2 (Dynein Cytoplasmic 1 Intermediate Chain 2), encoding a component of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex. In a consanguineous Pakistani family with three affected individuals presenting with microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, simplification of cerebral gyration, corpus callosum hypoplasia, and dysmorphic facial features, we identified a homozygous splice donor site variant (GenBank: NM_001378.2:c.607+1G>A). We report two additional individuals who have similar neurodevelopmental deficits and craniofacial features and harbor deleterious variants; one individual bears a c.740A>G (p.Tyr247Cys) change in trans with a 374 kb deletion encompassing DYNC1I2, and an unrelated individual harbors the compound-heterozygous variants c.868C>T (p.Gln290∗) and c.740A>G (p.Tyr247Cys). Zebrafish larvae subjected to CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption or transient suppression of dync1i2a displayed significantly altered craniofacial patterning with concomitant reduction in head size. We monitored cell death and cell cycle progression in dync1i2a zebrafish models and observed significantly increased apoptosis, likely due to prolonged mitosis caused by abnormal spindle morphology, and this finding offers initial insights into the cellular basis of microcephaly. Additionally, complementation studies in zebrafish demonstrate that p.Tyr247Cys attenuates gene function, consistent with protein structural analysis.

Molecular evaluation of polydactyly can serve as a tool to elucidate genetic and signaling pathways that regulate limb development, specifically, the anterior-posterior specification of the limb. To date, only five genes have been identified for nonsyndromic PAP: FAM92A, GLI1, GLI3, IQCE and ZNF141. In this study, two Pakistani multiplex consanguineous families with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic PAP were clinically and molecularly evaluated. From both pedigrees, a DNA sample from an affected member underwent exome sequencing. In each family, we identified a segregating frameshift (c.591dupA [p.(Q198Tfs*21)]) and nonsense variant (c.2173A > T [p.(K725*)]) in KIAA0825 (also known as C5orf36). Although KIAA0825 encodes a protein of unknown function, it has been demonstrated that its murine ortholog is expressed during limb development. Our data contribute to the establishment of a catalog of genes important in limb patterning, which can aid in diagnosis and obtaining a better understanding of the biology of polydactyly.",research-article; journal article
31079897,Heterozygous Variants in KMT2E Cause a Spectrum of Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Epilepsy.,"We delineate a KMT2E-related neurodevelopmental disorder on the basis of 38 individuals in 36 families. This study includes 31 distinct heterozygous variants in KMT2E (28 ascertained from Matchmaker Exchange and three previously reported), and four individuals with chromosome 7q22.2-22.23 microdeletions encompassing KMT2E (one previously reported). Almost all variants occurred de novo, and most were truncating. Most affected individuals with protein-truncating variants presented with mild intellectual disability. One-quarter of individuals met criteria for autism. Additional common features include macrocephaly, hypotonia, functional gastrointestinal abnormalities, and a subtle facial gestalt. Epilepsy was present in about one-fifth of individuals with truncating variants and was responsive to treatment with anti-epileptic medications in almost all. More than 70% of the individuals were male, and expressivity was variable by sex; epilepsy was more common in females and autism more common in males. The four individuals with microdeletions encompassing KMT2E generally presented similarly to those with truncating variants, but the degree of developmental delay was greater. The group of four individuals with missense variants in KMT2E presented with the most severe developmental delays. Epilepsy was present in all individuals with missense variants, often manifesting as treatment-resistant infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Microcephaly was also common in this group. Haploinsufficiency versus gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects specific to these missense variants in KMT2E might explain this divergence in phenotype, but requires independent validation. Disruptive variants in KMT2E are an under-recognized cause of neurodevelopmental abnormalities.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
30573563,"Biallelic mutations in USP45, encoding a deubiquitinating enzyme, are associated with Leber congenital amaurosis.","BACKGROUND:Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the earliest and most severe form of inherited retinal dystrophies. In approximately 56% of Chinese probands, genetic defects can be detected in known LCA-causing genes. In this study, the objective was to identify pathogenic variants in two unsolved Chinese families with LCA. METHODS:To identify the genetic defect, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and clinical analysis was performed in both probands with LCA as well as in 3011 in-house controls with other hereditary eye diseases. The expression profiles, as well as the phenotype analysis of knockdown zebrafish model and knockout mice model, were performed to investigate the function of USP45 in photoreceptors. RESULTS:By analysing WES data based on allele frequencies of in-house controls, population allele frequencies and in silico prediction tools, two rare homozygous mutations in USP45 were identified in two unrelated families. Immunohistochemistry of USP45 in the human and zebrafish retinal sections revealed enriched expression in the inner segments of photoreceptors. The knockdown of usp45 transcript in zebrafish led to abnormal retinal development with effects on photoreceptors, which could be successfully rescued by wild-type usp45 mRNA. Moreover, targeted knockout of Usp45 in mice caused abnormal electroretinography responses, similar to that seen in patients with LCA. CONCLUSIONS:Our study implicates that biallelic mutations in USP45 are associated with the occurrence of LCA. Moreover, our results indicate that USP45 is indispensable to the maintenance of photoreceptor function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
30309848,Selective loss of function variants in IL6ST cause Hyper-IgE syndrome with distinct impairments of T-cell phenotype and function.,"Hyper-IgE syndromes comprise a group of inborn errors of immunity. STAT3-deficient hyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by elevated serum IgE levels, recurrent infections and eczema, and characteristic skeletal anomalies. A loss-of-function biallelic mutation in IL6ST encoding the GP130 receptor subunit (p.N404Y) has very recently been identified in a singleton patient (herein referred to as PN404Y) as a novel etiology of hyper-IgE syndrome. Here, we studied a patient with hyper-IgE syndrome caused by a novel homozygous mutation in IL6ST (p.P498L; patient herein referred to as PP498L) leading to abrogated GP130 signaling after stimulation with IL-6 and IL-27 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as IL-6 and IL-11 in fibroblasts. Extending the initial identification of selective GP130 deficiency, we aimed to dissect the effects of aberrant cytokine signaling on T-helper cell differentiation in both patients. Our results reveal the importance of IL-6 signaling for the development of CCR6-expressing memory CD4+ T cells (including T-helper 17-enriched subsets) and non-conventional CD8+T cells which were reduced in both patients. Downstream functional analysis of the GP130 mutants (p.N404Y and p.P498L) have shown differences in response to IL-27, with the p.P498L mutation having a more severe effect that is reflected by reduced T-helper 1 cells in this patient (PP498L) only. Collectively, our data suggest that characteristic features of GP130-deficient hyper-IgE syndrome phenotype are IL-6 and IL-11 dominated, and indicate selective roles of aberrant IL-6 and IL-27 signaling on the differentiation of T-cell subsets.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
28747427,A biallelic mutation in IL6ST encoding the GP130 co-receptor causes immunodeficiency and craniosynostosis.,"Multiple cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-11, IL-27, oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), signal via the common GP130 cytokine receptor subunit. In this study, we describe a patient with a homozygous mutation of IL6ST (encoding GP130 p.N404Y) who presented with recurrent infections, eczema, bronchiectasis, high IgE, eosinophilia, defective B cell memory, and an impaired acute-phase response, as well as skeletal abnormalities including craniosynostosis. The p.N404Y missense substitution is associated with loss of IL-6, IL-11, IL-27, and OSM signaling but a largely intact LIF response. This study identifies a novel immunodeficiency with phenotypic similarities to STAT3 hyper-IgE syndrome caused by loss of function of GP130.",research-article; journal article
31025394,Novel mutations in MYBPC1 are associated with myogenic tremor and mild myopathy.,"OBJECTIVE:To define a distinct, dominantly inherited, mild skeletal myopathy associated with prominent and consistent tremor in two unrelated, three-generation families. METHODS:Clinical evaluations as well as exome and panel sequencing analyses were performed in affected and nonaffected members of two families to identify genetic variants segregating with the phenotype. Histological assessment of a muscle biopsy specimen was performed in 1 patient, and quantitative tremor analysis was carried out in 2 patients. Molecular modeling studies and biochemical assays were performed for both mutations. RESULTS:Two novel missense mutations in MYBPC1 (p.E248K in family 1 and p.Y247H in family 2) were identified and shown to segregate perfectly with the myopathy/tremor phenotype in the respective families. MYBPC1 encodes slow myosin binding protein-C (sMyBP-C), a modular sarcomeric protein playing structural and regulatory roles through its dynamic interaction with actin and myosin filaments. The Y247H and E248K mutations are located in the NH2 -terminal M-motif of sMyBP-C. Both mutations result in markedly increased binding of the NH2 terminus to myosin, possibly interfering with normal cross-bridge cycling as the first muscle-based step in tremor genesis. The clinical tremor features observed in all mutation carriers, together with the tremor physiology studies performed in family 2, suggest amplification by an additional central loop modulating the clinical tremor phenomenology. INTERPRETATION:Here, we link two novel missense mutations in MYBPC1 with a dominant, mild skeletal myopathy invariably associated with a distinctive tremor. The molecular, genetic, and clinical studies are consistent with a unique sarcomeric origin of the tremor, which we classify as ""myogenic tremor.""

30528822,Gain-of-Function Mutations in TRPM4 Activation Gate Cause Progressive Symmetric Erythrokeratodermia.,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels respond to various chemical and physical stimuli by mediating cation influx. The skin expresses abundant TRP channels of different subtypes, which play an essential role in the maintenance of skin functionality. Here, we report cases of mutations in TRPM4, which encodes TRPM4, a Ca2+-activated monovalent cation channel, as a cause of an autosomal dominant form of progressive symmetric erythrokeratodermia. In three separate families with progressive symmetric erythrokeratodermia, we identified two missense mutations (c.3099C>G and c.3119T>C) that produce p.Ile1033Met and p.Ile1040Thr, both of which are located in the S6 transmembrane domain of the TRPM4 protein. The substitutions are expected to directly affect activation gating of TRPM4 according to the cryo-EM structures. Electrophysiological studies of the mutants showed substantial hyperactivity, as evidenced by pronounced baseline activity, enhanced sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+, and an elevated resting membrane potential. InÂ vitro studies showed enhanced proliferation in keratinocytes overexpressing either of the mutants. We also detected an up-regulation of markers for proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes in the affected skin tissues. Our study identified TRPM4 as an important player in the pathogenesis of skin TRP channelopathies and a potential target for treatment of skin hyperkeratotic disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article"
30245514,Splice-altering variant in COL11A1 as a cause of nonsyndromic hearing loss DFNA37.,"PURPOSE:The aim of this study was to determine the genetic cause of autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss segregating in a multigenerational family. METHODS:Clinical examination, genome-wide linkage analysis, and exome sequencing were carried out on the family. RESULTS:Affected individuals presented with early-onset progressive mild hearing impairment with a fairly flat, gently downsloping or U-shaped audiogram configuration. Detailed clinical examination excluded any additional symptoms. Linkage analysis detected an interval on chromosome 1p21 with a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 8.29: designated locus DFNA37. Exome sequencing identified a novel canonical acceptor splice-site variant c.652-2A>C in the COL11A1 gene within the DFNA37 locus. Genotyping of all 48 family members confirmed segregation of this variant with the deafness phenotype in the extended family. The c.652-2A>C variant is novel, highly conserved, and confirmed in vitro to alter RNA splicing. CONCLUSION:We have identified COL11A1 as the gene responsible for deafness at the DFNA37 locus. Previously, COL11A1 was solely associated with Marshall and Stickler syndromes. This study expands its phenotypic spectrum to include nonsyndromic deafness. The implications of this discovery are valuable in the clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with COL11A1 pathogenic variants.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27776107,RASGRP1 deficiency causes immunodeficiency with impaired cytoskeletal dynamics.,"RASGRP1 is an important guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of the RAS-MAPK pathway following T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. The consequences of RASGRP1 mutations in humans are unknown. In a patient with recurrent bacterial and viral infections, born to healthy consanguineous parents, we used homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing to identify a biallelic stop-gain variant in RASGRP1. This variant segregated perfectly with the disease and has not been reported in genetic databases. RASGRP1 deficiency was associated in T cells and B cells with decreased phosphorylation of the extracellular-signal-regulated serine kinase ERK, which was restored following expression of wild-type RASGRP1. RASGRP1 deficiency also resulted in defective proliferation, activation and motility of T cells and B cells. RASGRP1-deficient natural killer (NK) cells exhibited impaired cytotoxicity with defective granule convergence and actin accumulation. Interaction proteomics identified the dynein light chain DYNLL1 as interacting with RASGRP1, which links RASGRP1 to cytoskeletal dynamics. RASGRP1-deficient cells showed decreased activation of the GTPase RhoA. Treatment with lenalidomide increased RhoA activity and reversed the migration and activation defects of RASGRP1-deficient lymphocytes.",research-article; journal article; case reports

The patient had epidermodysplasia verruciformis, suggesting a clinically important intrinsic T cell function defect. Like the previously described patient, our proband also presented with CD4+ T cell lymphopenia, impaired T cell proliferation to mitogens and antigens, reduced NK cell function, and EBV-associated lymphoma. The severity of the disease and the development of EBV lymphoma in both patients suggest that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be performed rapidly in patients with RASGRP1 deficiency.","letter; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31374204,Bi-allelic TARS Mutations Are Associated with Brittle Hair Phenotype.,"Brittle and ""tiger-tail"" hair is the diagnostic hallmark of trichothiodystrophy (TTD), a rare recessive disease associated with a wide spectrum of clinical features including ichthyosis, intellectual disability, decreased fertility, and short stature. As a result of premature abrogation of terminal differentiation, the hair is brittle and fragile and contains reduced cysteine content. Hypersensitivity to UV light is found in about half of individuals with TTD; all of these individuals harbor bi-allelic mutations in components of the basal transcription factor TFIIH, and these mutations lead to impaired nucleotide excision repair and basal transcription. Different genes have been found to be associated with non-photosensitive TTD (NPS-TTD); these include MPLKIP (also called TTDN1), GTF2E2 (also called TFIIEβ), and RNF113A. However, a relatively large group of these individuals with NPS-TTD have remained genetically uncharacterized. Here we present the identification of an NPS-TTD-associated gene, threonyl-tRNA synthetase (TARS), found by next-generation sequencing of a group of uncharacterized individuals with NPS-TTD. One individual has compound heterozygous TARS variants, c.826A>G (p.Lys276Glu) and c.1912C>T (p.Arg638∗), whereas a second individual is homozygous for the TARS variant: c.680T>C (p.Leu227Pro). We showed that these variants have a profound effect on TARS protein stability and enzymatic function. Our results expand the spectrum of genes involved in TTD to include genes implicated in amino acid charging of tRNA, which is required for the last step in gene expression, namely protein translation. We previously proposed that some of the TTD-specific features derive from subtle transcription defects as a consequence of unstable transcription factors. We now extend the definition of TTD from a transcription syndrome to a ""gene-expression"" syndrome.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

Hexokinase activity in red blood cells of two patients was normal, suggesting that the disease mechanism is not due to loss of hexokinase enzymatic activity.","clinical trial; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

31213488,Inherited IL-18BP deficiency in human fulminant viral hepatitis.,"Fulminant viral hepatitis (FVH) is a devastating and unexplained condition that strikes otherwise healthy individuals during primary infection with common liver-tropic viruses. We report a child who died of FVH upon infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) at age 11 yr and who was homozygous for a private 40-nucleotide deletion in IL18BP, which encodes the IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). This mutation is loss-of-function, unlike the variants found in a homozygous state in public databases. We show that human IL-18 and IL-18BP are both secreted mostly by hepatocytes and macrophages in the liver. Moreover, in the absence of IL-18BP, excessive NK cell activation by IL-18 results in uncontrolled killing of human hepatocytes in vitro. Inherited human IL-18BP deficiency thus underlies fulminant HAV hepatitis by unleashing IL-18. These findings provide proof-of-principle that FVH can be caused by single-gene inborn errors that selectively disrupt liver-specific immunity. They also show that human IL-18 is toxic to the liver and that IL-18BP is its antidote.",review-article; review; journal article
30918116,A pannexin 1 channelopathy causes human oocyte death.,"Connexins and pannexins are two protein families that play an important role in cellular communication. Pannexin 1 (PANX1), one of the members of pannexin family, is a channel protein. It is glycosylated and forms three species, GLY0, GLY1, and GLY2. Here, we describe four independent families in which mutations in PANX1 cause familial or sporadic female infertility via a phenotype that we term ""oocyte death."" The mutations, which are associated with oocyte death, alter the PANX1 glycosylation pattern, influence the subcellular localization of PANX1 in cultured cells, and result in aberrant PANX1 channel activity, ATP release in oocytes, and mutant PANX1 GLY1. Overexpression of a patient-derived mutation in mice causes infertility, recapitulating the human oocyte death phenotype. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of PANX1 in human oocyte development, provide a genetic explanation for a subtype of infertility, and suggest a potential target for therapeutic intervention for this disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
29559409,Expanded Retinal Disease Spectrum Associated With Autosomal Recessive Mutations in GUCY2D.,"PURPOSE:GUCY2D has been associated with autosomal recessive Leber congenital amaurosis and autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy. This report expands the phenotype of autosomal recessive mutations to congenital night blindness, which may slowly progress to mild retinitis pigmentosa. DESIGN:Retrospective case series. METHODS:Multicenter study of 5 patients (3 male, 2 female). RESULTS:All patients presented with night blindness since childhood. Age at referral was 9-45 years. Length of follow-up was 1-7 years. Best-corrected visual acuity at presentation ranged from 20/15 to 20/30 and at most recent visit averaged 20/25. No patient had nystagmus or high refractive error. ISCEV standard electroretinography revealed nondetectable dark-adapted dim flash responses and reduced amplitude but not electronegative dark-adapted bright flash responses with similar waveforms to the reduced-amplitude light-adapted single flash responses. The 30 Hz flicker responses were relatively preserved. Macular optical coherence tomography revealed normal lamination in 3 patients, with abnormalities in 2. Goldmann visual fields were normal at presentation in children but constricted in 1 adult. One child showed loss of midperipheral fields over time. Fundus appearance was normal in childhood; the adult had sparse bone spicule-like pigmentation. Full-field stimulus testing (FST) revealed markedly decreased retinal sensitivity to light. Dark adaptation demonstrated lack of rod-cone break. Two patients had tritanopia. All 5 had compound heterozygous mutations in GUCY2D. Three of the 5 patients harbor the Arg768Trp mutation reported in GUCY2D-associated Leber congenital amaurosis. CONCLUSIONS:Autosomal recessive GUCY2D mutations may cause congenital night blindness with normal acuity and refraction, and unique electroretinography. Progression to mild retinitis pigmentosa may occur.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; multicenter study; journal article; case reports"
29961870,De novo variants in GABRA2 and GABRA5 alter receptor function and contribute to early-onset epilepsy.,"GABAA receptors are ligand-gated anion channels that are important regulators of neuronal inhibition. Mutations in several genes encoding receptor subunits have been identified in patients with various types of epilepsy, ranging from mild febrile seizures to severe epileptic encephalopathy. Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified a novel de novo missense variant in GABRA5 (c.880G > C, p.V294L) in a patient with severe early-onset epilepsy and developmental delay. Targeted resequencing of 279 additional epilepsy patients identified 19 rare variants from nine GABAA receptor genes, including a novel de novo missense variant in GABRA2 (c.875C > A, p.T292K) and a recurrent missense variant in GABRB3 (c.902C > T, p.P301L). Patients with the GABRA2 and GABRB3 variants also presented with severe epilepsy and developmental delay. We evaluated the effects of the GABRA5, GABRA2 and GABRB3 missense variants on receptor function using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from human embryonic kidney 293T cells expressing appropriate α, β and γ subunits. The GABRA5 p.V294L variant produced receptors that were 10-times more sensitive to GABA but had reduced maximal GABA-evoked current due to increased receptor desensitization. The GABRA2 p.T292K variant reduced channel expression and produced mutant channels that were tonically open, even in the absence of GABA. Receptors containing the GABRB3 p.P301L variant were less sensitive to GABA and produced less GABA-evoked current. These results provide the first functional evidence that de novo variants in the GABRA5 and GABRA2 genes contribute to early-onset epilepsy and developmental delay, and demonstrate that epilepsy can result from reduced neuronal inhibition via a wide range of alterations in GABAA receptor function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29422393,A de novo GABRA2 missense mutation in severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with a choreiform movement disorder.,"Early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) is a severe convulsive disorder with a poor developmental prognosis. Although it has been associated with mutations in a number of genes, the fact that there is a large proportion of patients who remain undiagnosed suggests that there are many more still-unknown genetic causes of EOEE. Achieving a genetic diagnosis is important for understanding the biological basis of the disease, with its implications for treatment and family planning.Whole-exome sequencing was performed in a family of Ashkenazi Jewish origin in which a male infant was diagnosed with EOEE. There was no family history of a similar neurologic disease. The patient had extreme hypotonia, neonatal hypothermia, choreiform movements, and vision impairment in addition to the convulsive disorder.A de novo heterozygous missense mutation, c.1003A > C, p.Asn335His, was identified in a conserved domain of GABRA2. GABRA2 encodes the α2 subunit of the GABAA receptor.In the context of previous reports of an association of de novo mutations in genes encoding different subunits of the GABAA receptor (GABRB1, GABRA1, GABRG2, GABRB3) with autosomal dominant epileptic disorders, we conclude that a de novo mutation in GABRA2 is likely to cause autosomal dominant EOEE accompanied by a movement disorder and vision impairment.",journal article; case reports
31056671,Altered inhibitory synapses in de novo GABRA5 and GABRA1 mutations associated with early onset epileptic encephalopathies.,"We performed next generation sequencing on 1696 patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability using a gene panel with 480 epilepsy-related genes including all GABAA receptor subunit genes (GABRs), and we identified six de novo GABR mutations, two novel GABRA5 mutations (c.880G>T, p.V294F and c.1238C>T, p.S413F), two novel GABRA1 mutations (c.778C>T, p.P260S and c.887T>C, p.L296S/c.944G>T, p.W315L) and two known GABRA1 mutations (c.335G>A, p.R112Q and c.343A>G, p.N115D) in six patients with intractable early onset epileptic encephalopathy. The α5(V294F and S413F) and α1(P260S and L296S/W315L) subunit residue substitutions were all in transmembrane domains, while the α1(R112Q and N115R) subunit residue substitutions were in the N-terminal GABA binding domain. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we compared effects of mutant GABAA receptor α5 and α1 subunits on the properties of recombinant α5β3γ2 and α1β3γ2 GABAA receptors in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and characterized their effects on receptor clustering, biogenesis and channel function. GABAA receptors containing mutant α5 and α1 subunits all had reduced cell surface and total cell expression with altered endoplasmic reticulum processing, impaired synaptic clustering, reduced GABAA receptor function and decreased GABA binding potency. Our study identified GABRA5 as a causative gene for early onset epileptic encephalopathy and expands the mutant GABRA1 phenotypic spectrum, supporting growing evidence that defects in GABAergic neurotransmission contribute to early onset epileptic encephalopathy phenotypes.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27666438,Disruption of a miR-29 binding site leading to COL4A1 upregulation causes pontine autosomal dominant microangiopathy with leukoencephalopathy.,"Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a heterogeneous group of disorders. Screening of known cSVD genes identifies the causative mutation in <15% of familial cSVD cases. We sought to identify novel causes of cSVD.We used linkage analysis and exome sequencing to identify the causal mutation in a French cSVD family. The identified candidate gene was then screened in 202 cSVD unrelated probands, including 1 proband from the first reported pontine autosomal dominant microangiopathy with leukoencephalopathy (PADMAL) family. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm variants in all mutated probands and analyze their segregation in probands' relatives. Mutation consequences were assessed with luciferase reporter assays and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).A candidate heterozygous variant located in a predicted miR-29 microRNA binding site, within the 3' untranslated region of COL4A1, was identified in the large French cSVD family. Five additional unrelated probands, including the PADMAL proband, harbored heterozygous variants in this microRNA binding site. Variants cosegregated with the affected phenotype, and cumulative logarithm of odds score reached 6.03, establishing linkage to this locus. A highly significant difference was observed when comparing the number of variants within this binding site in cases and controls (p = 1.77 × 10E-12). RT-qPCR analyses of patients' primary fibroblasts and luciferase reporter assays strongly favor an upregulation of COL4A1 mediated by disruption of miR-29 binding to its target site. Magnetic resonance imaging features were characterized by the presence of multiple pontine infarcts in all symptomatic mutation carriers.Mutations upregulating COL4A1 expression lead to PADMAL, a severe early onset ischemic cSVD, distinct from the various phenotypes associated with COL4A1 missense glycine mutations.

28973171,Defective mitochondrial rRNA methyltransferase MRM2 causes MELAS-like clinical syndrome.,"Defects in nuclear-encoded proteins of the mitochondrial translation machinery cause early-onset and tissue-specific deficiency of one or more OXPHOS complexes. Here, we report a 7-year-old Italian boy with childhood-onset rapidly progressive encephalomyopathy and stroke-like episodes. Multiple OXPHOS defects and decreased mtDNA copy number (40%) were detected in muscle homogenate. Clinical features combined with low level of plasma citrulline were highly suggestive of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, however, the common m.3243 A > G mutation was excluded. Targeted exome sequencing of genes encoding the mitochondrial proteome identified a damaging mutation, c.567 G > A, affecting a highly conserved amino acid residue (p.Gly189Arg) of the MRM2 protein. MRM2 has never before been linked to a human disease and encodes an enzyme responsible for 2'-O-methyl modification at position U1369 in the human mitochondrial 16S rRNA. We generated a knockout yeast model for the orthologous gene that showed a defect in respiration and the reduction of the 2'-O-methyl modification at the equivalent position (U2791) in the yeast mitochondrial 21S rRNA. Complementation with the mrm2 allele carrying the equivalent yeast mutation failed to rescue the respiratory phenotype, which was instead completely rescued by expressing the wild-type allele. Our findings establish that defective MRM2 causes a MELAS-like phenotype, and suggests the genetic screening of the MRM2 gene in patients with a m.3243 A > G negative MELAS-like presentation.",research-article; journal article; case reports
31363758,Defective tubulin detyrosination causes structural brain abnormalities with cognitive deficiency in humans and mice.,"Reversible detyrosination of tubulin, the building block of microtubules, is crucial for neuronal physiology. Enzymes responsible for detyrosination were recently identified as complexes of vasohibins (VASHs) one or two with small VASH-binding protein (SVBP). Here we report three consanguineous families, each containing multiple individuals with biallelic inactivation of SVBP caused by truncating variants (p.Q28* and p.K13Nfs*18). Affected individuals show brain abnormalities with microcephaly, intellectual disability and delayed gross motor and speech development. Immunoblot testing in cells with pathogenic SVBP variants demonstrated that the encoded proteins were unstable and non-functional, resulting in a complete loss of VASH detyrosination activity. Svbp knockout mice exhibit drastic accumulation of tyrosinated tubulin and a reduction of detyrosinated tubulin in brain tissue. Similar alterations in tubulin tyrosination levels were observed in cultured neurons and associated with defects in axonal differentiation and architecture. Morphological analysis of the Svbp knockout mouse brains by anatomical magnetic resonance imaging showed a broad impact of SVBP loss, with a 7% brain volume decrease, numerous structural defects and a 30% reduction of some white matter tracts. Svbp knockout mice display behavioural defects, including mild hyperactivity, lower anxiety and impaired social behaviour. They do not, however, show prominent memory defects. Thus, SVBP-deficient mice recapitulate several features observed in human patients. Altogether, our data demonstrate that deleterious variants in SVBP cause this neurodevelopmental pathology, by leading to a major change in brain tubulin tyrosination and alteration of microtubule dynamics and neuron physiology.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

30622326,"Biallelic sequence variants in INTS1 in patients with developmental delays, cataracts, and craniofacial anomalies.","The Integrator complex subunit 1 (INTS1) is a component of the integrator complex that comprises 14 subunits and associates with RPB1 to catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of nascent snRNAs and assist RNA polymerase II in promoter-proximal pause-release on protein-coding genes. We present five patients, including two sib pairs, with biallelic sequence variants in INTS1. The patients manifested absent or severely limited speech, an abnormal gait, hypotonia and cataracts. Exome sequencing revealed biallelic variants in INTS1 in all patients. One sib pair demonstrated a missense variant, p.(Arg77Cys), and a frameshift variant, p.(Arg1800Profs*20), another sib pair had a homozygous missense variant, p.(Pro1874Leu), and the fifth patient had a frameshift variant, p.(Leu1764Cysfs*16) and a missense variant, p.(Leu2164Pro). We also report additional clinical data on three previously described individuals with a homozygous, loss of function variant, p.(Ser1784*) in INTS1 that shared cognitive delays, cataracts and dysmorphic features with these patients. Several of the variants affected the protein C-terminus and preliminary modeling showed that the p.(Pro1874Leu) and p.(Leu2164Pro) variants may interfere with INTS1 helix folding. In view of the cataracts observed, we performed in-situ hybridization and demonstrated expression of ints1 in the zebrafish eye. We used Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to make larvae with biallelic insertion/deletion (indel) variants in ints1. The mutant larvae developed typically through gastrulation, but sections of the eye showed abnormal lens development. The distinctive phenotype associated with biallelic variants in INTS1 points to dysfunction of the integrator complex as a mechanism for intellectual disability, eye defects and craniofacial anomalies.",research-article; journal article
28542170,Human mutations in integrator complex subunits link transcriptome integrity to brain development.,"Integrator is an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-associated complex that was recently identified to have a broad role in both RNA processing and transcription regulation. Importantly, its role in human development and disease is so far largely unexplored. Here, we provide evidence that biallelic Integrator Complex Subunit 1 (INTS1) and Subunit 8 (INTS8) gene mutations are associated with rare recessive human neurodevelopmental syndromes. Three unrelated individuals of Dutch ancestry showed the same homozygous truncating INTS1 mutation. Three siblings harboured compound heterozygous INTS8 mutations. Shared features by these six individuals are severe neurodevelopmental delay and a distinctive appearance. The INTS8 family in addition presented with neuronal migration defects (periventricular nodular heterotopia). We show that the first INTS8 mutation, a nine base-pair deletion, leads to a protein that disrupts INT complex stability, while the second missense mutation introduces an alternative splice site leading to an unstable messenger. Cells from patients with INTS8 mutations show increased levels of unprocessed UsnRNA, compatible with the INT function in the 3'-end maturation of UsnRNA, and display significant disruptions in gene expression and RNA processing. Finally, the introduction of the INTS8 deletion mutation in P19 cells using genome editing alters gene expression throughout the course of retinoic acid-induced neural differentiation. Altogether, our results confirm the essential role of Integrator to transcriptome integrity and point to the requirement of the Integrator complex in human brain development.",research-article; journal article
28419241,Central Hypothyroidism Due to a TRHR Mutation Causing Impaired Ligand Affinity and Transactivation of Gq.,"Context:Central congenital hypothyroidism (CCH) is an underdiagnosed disorder characterized by deficient production and bioactivity of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) leading to low thyroid hormone synthesis. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor (TRHR) defects are rare recessive disorders usually associated with incidentally identified CCH and short stature in childhood. Objectives:Clinical and genetic characterization of a consanguineous family of Roma origin with central hypothyroidism and identification of underlying molecular mechanisms. Design:All family members were phenotyped with thyroid hormone profiles, pituitary magnetic resonance imaging, TRH tests, and dynamic tests for other pituitary hormones. Candidate TRH, TRHR, TSHB, and IGSF1 genes were screened for mutations. A mutant TRHR was characterized in vitro and by molecular modeling. Results:A homozygous missense mutation in TRHR (c.392T > C; p.I131T) was identified in an 8-year-old boy with moderate hypothyroidism (TSH: 2.61 mIU/L, Normal: 0.27 to 4.2; free thyroxine: 9.52 pmol/L, Normal: 10.9 to 25.7) who was overweight (body mass index: 20.4 kg/m2, p91) but had normal stature (122 cm; -0.58 standard deviation). His mother, two brothers, and grandmother were heterozygous for the mutation with isolated hyperthyrotropinemia (TSH: 4.3 to 8 mIU/L). The I131T mutation, in TRHR intracellular loop 2, decreases TRH affinity and increases the half-maximal effective concentration for signaling. Modeling of TRHR-Gq complexes predicts that the mutation disrupts the interaction between receptor and a hydrophobic pocket formed by Gq. Conclusions:A unique missense TRHR defect identified in a consanguineous family is associated with central hypothyroidism in homozygotes and hyperthyrotropinemia in heterozygotes, suggesting compensatory elevation of TSH with reduced biopotency. The I131T mutation decreases TRH binding and TRHR-Gq coupling and signaling.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; review; journal article; case reports"
30293988,De novo missense variants in RAC3 cause a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome.,"PURPOSE:RAC3 is an underexamined member of the Rho GTPase gene family that is expressed in the developing brain and linked to key cellular functions. De novo missense variants in the homolog RAC1 were recently associated with developmental disorders. In the RAC subfamily, transforming missense changes at certain shared residues have been observed in human cancers and previously characterized in experimental studies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether constitutional dysregulation of RAC3 is associated with human disease. METHODS:We discovered a RAC3 variant in the index case using genome sequencing, and searched for additional variants using international data-sharing initiatives. Functional effects of the variants were assessed using a multifaceted approach generalizable to most clinical laboratory settings. RESULTS:We rapidly identified five individuals with de novo monoallelic missense variants in RAC3, including one recurrent change. Every participant had severe intellectual disability and brain malformations. In silico protein modeling, and prior in vivo and in situ experiments, supported a transforming effect for each of the three different RAC3 variants. All variants were observed in databases of somatic variation in cancer. CONCLUSIONS:Missense variants in RAC3 cause a novel brain disorder, likely through a mechanism of constitutive protein activation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29276006,WNT Signaling Perturbations Underlie the Genetic Heterogeneity of Robinow Syndrome.,"Locus heterogeneity characterizes a variety of skeletal dysplasias often due to interacting or overlapping signaling pathways. Robinow syndrome is a skeletal disorder historically refractory to molecular diagnosis, potentially stemming from substantial genetic heterogeneity. All current known pathogenic variants reside in genes within the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway including ROR2, WNT5A, and more recently, DVL1 and DVL3. However, ∼70% of autosomal-dominant Robinow syndrome cases remain molecularly unsolved. To investigate this missing heritability, we recruited 21 families with at least one family member clinically diagnosed with Robinow or Robinow-like phenotypes and performed genetic and genomic studies. In total, four families with variants in FZD2 were identified as well as three individuals from two families with biallelic variants in NXN that co-segregate with the phenotype. Importantly, both FZD2 and NXN are relevant protein partners in the WNT5A interactome, supporting their role in skeletal development. In addition to confirming that clustered -1 frameshifting variants in DVL1 and DVL3 are the main contributors to dominant Robinow syndrome, we also found likely pathogenic variants in candidate genes GPC4 and RAC3, both linked to the Wnt signaling pathway. These data support an initial hypothesis that Robinow syndrome results from perturbation of the Wnt/PCP pathway, suggest specific relevant domains of the proteins involved, and reveal key contributors in this signaling cascade during human embryonic development. Contrary to the view that non-allelic genetic heterogeneity hampers gene discovery, this study demonstrates the utility of rare disease genomic studies to parse gene function in human developmental pathways.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31092906,Biallelic variants in the transcription factor PAX7 are a new genetic cause of myopathy.,"PURPOSE:Skeletal muscle growth and regeneration rely on muscle stem cells, called satellite cells. Specific transcription factors, particularly PAX7, are key regulators of the function of these cells. Knockout of this factor in mice leads to poor postnatal survival; however, the consequences of a lack of PAX7 in humans have not been established. METHODS:Here, we study five individuals with myopathy of variable severity from four unrelated consanguineous couples. Exome sequencing identified pathogenic variants in the PAX7 gene. Clinical examination, laboratory tests, and muscle biopsies were performed to characterize the disease. RESULTS:The disease was characterized by hypotonia, ptosis, muscular atrophy, scoliosis, and mildly dysmorphic facial features. The disease spectrum ranged from mild to severe and appears to be progressive. Muscle biopsies showed the presence of atrophic fibers and fibroadipose tissue replacement, with the absence of myofiber necrosis. A lack of PAX7 expression was associated with satellite cell pool exhaustion; however, the presence of residual myoblasts together with regenerating myofibers suggest that a population of PAX7-independent myogenic cells partially contributes to muscle regeneration. CONCLUSION:These findings show that biallelic variants in the master transcription factor PAX7 cause a new type of myopathy that specifically affects satellite cell survival.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
31256876,Mutations in PIGB Cause an Inherited GPI Biosynthesis Defect with an Axonal Neuropathy and Metabolic Abnormality in Severe Cases.,"Proteins anchored to the cell surface via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) play various key roles in the human body, particularly in development and neurogenesis. As such, many developmental disorders are caused by mutations in genes involved in the GPI biosynthesis and remodeling pathway. We describe ten unrelated families with bi-allelic mutations in PIGB, a gene that encodes phosphatidylinositol glycan class B, which transfers the third mannose to the GPI. Ten different PIGB variants were found in these individuals. Flow cytometric analysis of blood cells and fibroblasts from the affected individuals showed decreased cell surface presence of GPI-anchored proteins. Most of the affected individuals have global developmental and/or intellectual delay, all had seizures, two had polymicrogyria, and four had a peripheral neuropathy. Eight children passed away before four years old. Two of them had a clinical diagnosis of DOORS syndrome (deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures), a condition that includes sensorineural deafness, shortened terminal phalanges with small finger and toenails, intellectual disability, and seizures; this condition overlaps with the severe phenotypes associated with inherited GPI deficiency. Most individuals tested showed elevated alkaline phosphatase, which is a characteristic of the inherited GPI deficiency but not DOORS syndrome. It is notable that two severely affected individuals showed 2-oxoglutaric aciduria, which can be seen in DOORS syndrome, suggesting that severe cases of inherited GPI deficiency and DOORS syndrome might share some molecular pathway disruptions.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31104773,A Recurrent Missense Variant in AP2M1 Impairs Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis and Causes Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy.,"The developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are heterogeneous disorders with a strong genetic contribution, but the underlying genetic etiology remains unknown in a significant proportion of individuals. To explore whether statistical support for genetic etiologies can be generated on the basis of phenotypic features, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing data and phenotypic similarities by using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) in 314 individuals with DEEs. We identified a de novo c.508C>T (p.Arg170Trp) variant in AP2M1 in two individuals with a phenotypic similarity that was higher than expected by chance (p = 0.003) and a phenotype related to epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures. We subsequently found the same de novo variant in two individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and generalized epilepsy in a cohort of 2,310 individuals who underwent diagnostic whole-exome sequencing. AP2M1 encodes the μ-subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), which is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and synaptic vesicle recycling. Modeling of protein dynamics indicated that the p.Arg170Trp variant impairs the conformational activation and thermodynamic entropy of the AP-2 complex. Functional complementation of both the μ-subunit carrying the p.Arg170Trp variant in human cells and astrocytes derived from AP-2μ conditional knockout mice revealed a significant impairment of CME of transferrin. In contrast, stability, expression levels, membrane recruitment, and localization were not impaired, suggesting a functional alteration of the AP-2 complex as the underlying disease mechanism. We establish a recurrent pathogenic variant in AP2M1 as a cause of DEEs with distinct phenotypic features, and we implicate dysfunction of the early steps of endocytosis as a disease mechanism in epilepsy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31353022,"Mutations in PIGU Impair the Function of the GPI Transamidase Complex, Causing Severe Intellectual Disability, Epilepsy, and Brain Anomalies.","The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor links over 150 proteins to the cell surface and is present on every cell type. Many of these proteins play crucial roles in neuronal development and function. Mutations in 18 of the 29 genes implicated in the biosynthesis of the GPI anchor have been identified as the cause of GPI biosynthesis deficiencies (GPIBDs) in humans. GPIBDs are associated with intellectual disability and seizures as their cardinal features. An essential component of the GPI transamidase complex is PIGU, along with PIGK, PIGS, PIGT, and GPAA1, all of which link GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) onto the GPI anchor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we report two homozygous missense mutations (c.209T>A [p.Ile70Lys] and c.1149C>A [p.Asn383Lys]) in five individuals from three unrelated families. All individuals presented with global developmental delay, severe-to-profound intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, seizures, brain anomalies, scoliosis, and mild facial dysmorphism. Using multicolor flow cytometry, we determined a characteristic profile for GPI transamidase deficiency. On granulocytes this profile consisted of reduced cell-surface expression of fluorescein-labeled proaerolysin (FLAER), CD16, and CD24, but not of CD55 and CD59; additionally, B cells showed an increased expression of free GPI anchors determined by T5 antibody. Moreover, computer-assisted facial analysis of different GPIBDs revealed a characteristic facial gestalt shared among individuals with mutations in PIGU and GPAA1. Our findings improve our understanding of the role of the GPI transamidase complex in the development of nervous and skeletal systems and expand the clinical spectrum of disorders belonging to the group of inherited GPI-anchor deficiencies.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29058690,Advillin acts upstream of phospholipase C ϵ1 in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.,"Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a frequent cause of chronic kidney disease. Here, we identified recessive mutations in the gene encoding the actin-binding protein advillin (AVIL) in 3 unrelated families with SRNS. While all AVIL mutations resulted in a marked loss of its actin-bundling ability, truncation of AVIL also disrupted colocalization with F-actin, thereby leading to impaired actin binding and severing. Additionally, AVIL colocalized and interacted with the phospholipase enzyme PLCE1 and with the ARP2/3 actin-modulating complex. Knockdown of AVIL in human podocytes reduced actin stress fibers at the cell periphery, prevented recruitment of PLCE1 to the ARP3-rich lamellipodia, blocked EGF-induced generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) by PLCE1, and attenuated the podocyte migration rate (PMR). These effects were reversed by overexpression of WT AVIL but not by overexpression of any of the 3 patient-derived AVIL mutants. The PMR was increased by overexpression of WT Avil or PLCE1, or by EGF stimulation; however, this increased PMR was ameliorated by inhibition of the ARP2/3 complex, indicating that ARP-dependent lamellipodia formation occurs downstream of AVIL and PLCE1 function. Together, these results delineate a comprehensive pathogenic axis of SRNS that integrates loss of AVIL function with alterations in the action of PLCE1, an established SRNS protein.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29330545,De novo BK channel variant causes epilepsy by affecting voltage gating but not Ca2+ sensitivity.,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases and it causes profound morbidity and mortality. We identified the first de novo variant in KCNMA1 (c.2984 A > G (p.(N995S)))-encoding the BK channel-that causes epilepsy, but not paroxysmal dyskinesia, in two independent families. The c.2984 A > G (p.(N995S)) variant markedly increased the macroscopic potassium current by increasing both the channel open probability and channel open dwell time. The c.2984 A > G (p.(N995S)) variant did not affect the calcium sensitivity of the channel. We also identified three other variants of unknown significance (c.1554 G > T (p.(K518N)), c.1967A > C (p.(E656A)), and c.3476 A > G (p.(N1159S))) in three separate patients with divergent epileptic phenotypes. However, these variants did not affect the BK potassium current, and are therefore unlikely to be disease-causing. These results demonstrate that BK channel variants can cause epilepsy without paroxysmal dyskinesia. The underlying molecular mechanism can be increased activation of the BK channel by increased sensitivity to the voltage-dependent activation without affecting the sensitivity to the calcium-dependent activation. Our data suggest that the BK channel may represent a drug target for the treatment of epilepsy. Our data highlight the importance of functional electrophysiological studies of BK channel variants in distinguishing whether a genomic variant of unknown significance is a disease-causing variant or a benign variant.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31332433,SOD1 deficiency: a novel syndrome distinct from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is the principal cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase in humans and plays a major role in redox potential regulation. It catalyses the transformation of the superoxide anion (O2•-) into hydrogen peroxide. Heterozygous variants in SOD1 are a common cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this study we describe the homozygous truncating variant c.335dupG (p.C112Wfs*11) in SOD1 that leads to total absence of enzyme activity. The resulting phenotype is severe and marked by progressive loss of motor abilities, tetraspasticity with predominance in the lower extremities, mild cerebellar atrophy, and hyperekplexia-like symptoms. Heterozygous carriers have a markedly reduced enzyme activity when compared to wild-type controls but show no overt neurologic phenotype. These results are in contrast with the previously proposed theory that a loss of function is the underlying mechanism in SOD1-related motor neuron disease and should be considered before application of previously proposed SOD1 silencing as a treatment option for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31353023,De Novo Heterozygous POLR2A Variants Cause a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome with Profound Infantile-Onset Hypotonia.,"The RNA polymerase II complex (pol II) is responsible for transcription of all ∼21,000 human protein-encoding genes. Here, we describe sixteen individuals harboring de novo heterozygous variants in POLR2A, encoding RPB1, the largest subunit of pol II. An iterative approach combining structural evaluation and mass spectrometry analyses, the use of S. cerevisiae as a model system, and the assessment of cell viability in HeLa cells allowed us to classify eleven variants as probably disease-causing and four variants as possibly disease-causing. The significance of one variant remains unresolved. By quantification of phenotypic severity, we could distinguish mild and severe phenotypic consequences of the disease-causing variants. Missense variants expected to exert only mild structural effects led to a malfunctioning pol II enzyme, thereby inducing a dominant-negative effect on gene transcription. Intriguingly, individuals carrying these variants presented with a severe phenotype dominated by profound infantile-onset hypotonia and developmental delay. Conversely, individuals carrying variants expected to result in complete loss of function, thus reduced levels of functional pol II from the normal allele, exhibited the mildest phenotypes. We conclude that subtle variants that are central in functionally important domains of POLR2A cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by profound infantile-onset hypotonia and developmental delay through a dominant-negative effect on pol-II-mediated transcription of DNA.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31303265,De Novo Variants Disturbing the Transactivation Capacity of POU3F3 Cause a Characteristic Neurodevelopmental Disorder.,"POU3F3, also referred to as Brain-1, is a well-known transcription factor involved in the development of the central nervous system, but it has not previously been associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder. Here, we report the identification of 19 individuals with heterozygous POU3F3 disruptions, most of which are de novo variants. All individuals had developmental delays and/or intellectual disability and impairments in speech and language skills. Thirteen individuals had characteristic low-set, prominent, and/or cupped ears. Brain abnormalities were observed in seven of eleven MRI reports. POU3F3 is an intronless gene, insensitive to nonsense-mediated decay, and 13 individuals carried protein-truncating variants. All truncating variants that we tested in cellular models led to aberrant subcellular localization of the encoded protein. Luciferase assays demonstrated negative effects of these alleles on transcriptional activation of a reporter with a FOXP2-derived binding motif. In addition to the loss-of-function variants, five individuals had missense variants that clustered at specific positions within the functional domains, and one small in-frame deletion was identified. Two missense variants showed reduced transactivation capacity in our assays, whereas one variant displayed gain-of-function effects, suggesting a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. In bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) interaction assays, all the truncated POU3F3 versions that we tested had significantly impaired dimerization capacities, whereas all missense variants showed unaffected dimerization with wild-type POU3F3. Taken together, our identification and functional cell-based analyses of pathogenic variants in POU3F3, coupled with a clinical characterization, implicate disruptions of this gene in a characteristic neurodevelopmental disorder.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

It confirms the key role of membrane trafficking in normal brain development and homeostasis.",journal article
30624672,A neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the VPS51 subunit of the GARP and EARP complexes.,"Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) and endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) are related heterotetrameric complexes that associate with the cytosolic face of the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes, respectively. At these locations, GARP and EARP function to promote the fusion of endosome-derived transport carriers with their corresponding compartments. GARP and EARP share three subunits, VPS51, VPS52 and VPS53, and each has an additional complex-specific subunit, VPS54 or VPS50, respectively. The role of these complexes in human physiology, however, remains poorly understood. By exome sequencing, we have identified compound heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the shared GARP/EARP subunit VPS51 in a 6-year-old patient with severe global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, epilepsy, cortical vision impairment, pontocerebellar abnormalities, failure to thrive, liver dysfunction, lower extremity edema and dysmorphic features. The mutation in one allele causes a frameshift that produces a longer but highly unstable protein that is degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, the other mutant allele produces a protein with a single amino acid substitution that is stable but assembles less efficiently with the other GARP/EARP subunits. Consequently, skin fibroblasts from the patient have reduced levels of fully assembled GARP and EARP complexes. Likely because of this deficiency, the patient's fibroblasts display altered distribution of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which normally sorts acid hydrolases to lysosomes. Furthermore, a fraction of the patient's fibroblasts exhibits swelling of lysosomes. These findings thus identify a novel genetic locus for a neurodevelopmental disorder and highlight the critical importance of GARP/EARP function in cellular and organismal physiology.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
31051115,Rare Variants in BNC2 Are Implicated in Autosomal-Dominant Congenital Lower Urinary-Tract Obstruction.,"Congenital lower urinary-tract obstruction (LUTO) is caused by anatomical blockage of the bladder outflow tract or by functional impairment of urinary voiding. About three out of 10,000 pregnancies are affected. Although several monogenic causes of functional obstruction have been defined, it is unknown whether congenital LUTO caused by anatomical blockage has a monogenic cause. Exome sequencing in a family with four affected individuals with anatomical blockage of the urethra identified a rare nonsense variant (c.2557C>T [p.Arg853∗]) in BNC2, encoding basonuclin 2, tracking with LUTO over three generations. Re-sequencing BNC2 in 697 individuals with LUTO revealed three further independent missense variants in three unrelated families. In human and mouse embryogenesis, basonuclin 2 was detected in lower urinary-tract rudiments. In zebrafish embryos, bnc2 was expressed in the pronephric duct and cloaca, analogs of the mammalian lower urinary tract. Experimental knockdown of Bnc2 in zebrafish caused pronephric-outlet obstruction and cloacal dilatation, phenocopying human congenital LUTO. Collectively, these results support the conclusion that variants in BNC2 are strongly implicated in LUTO etiology as a result of anatomical blockage.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
30120214,"Homozygous variants in KIAA1549, encoding a ciliary protein, are associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.","BACKGROUND:Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) shows substantial genetic heterogeneity. It has been estimated that in approximately 60%-80% of RP cases, the genetic diagnosis can be found using whole exome sequencing (WES). In this study, the purpose was to identify causative variants in individuals with genetically unexplained retinal disease, which included one consanguineous family with two affected siblings and one case with RP. METHODS:To identify the genetic defect, WES was performed in both probands, and clinical analysis was performed. To obtain insight into the function of KIAA1549 in photoreceptors, mRNA expression, knockdown and protein localisation studies were performed. RESULTS:Through analysis of WES data, based on population allele frequencies, and in silico prediction tools, we identified a homozygous missense variant and a homozygous frameshift variant in KIAA1549 that segregate in two unrelated families. Kiaa1549 was found to localise at the connecting cilium of the photoreceptor cells and the synapses of the mouse retina. Both variants affect the long transcript of KIAA1549, which encodes a 1950 amino acid protein and shows prominent brain expression. The shorter transcript encodes a 734 amino acid protein with a high retinal expression and is affected by the identified missense variant. Strikingly, knockdown of the long transcript also leads to decreased expression of the short transcript likely explaining the non-syndromic retinal phenotype caused by the two variants targeting different transcripts. CONCLUSION:In conclusion, our results underscore the causality of segregating variants in KIAA1549 for autosomal recessive RP. Moreover, our data indicate that KIAA1549 plays a role in photoreceptor function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
30804514,Gain-of-function mutation of microRNA-140 in human skeletal dysplasia.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Heterozygous loss-of-function point mutations of miRNA genes are associated with several human congenital disorders1-5, but neomorphic (gain-of-new-function) mutations in miRNAs due to nucleotide substitutions have not been reported. Here we describe a neomorphic seed region mutation in the chondrocyte-specific, super-enhancer-associated MIR140 gene encoding microRNA-140 (miR-140) in a novel autosomal dominant human skeletal dysplasia. Mice with the corresponding single nucleotide substitution show skeletal abnormalities similar to those of the patients but distinct from those of miR-140-null mice6. This mutant miRNA gene yields abundant mutant miR-140-5p expression without miRNA-processing defects. In chondrocytes, the mutation causes widespread derepression of wild-type miR-140-5p targets and repression of mutant miR-140-5p targets, indicating that the mutation produces both loss-of-function and gain-of-function effects. Furthermore, the mutant miR-140-5p seed competes with the conserved RNA-binding protein Ybx1 for overlapping binding sites. This finding may explain the potent target repression and robust in vivo effect by this mutant miRNA even in the absence of evolutionary selection of miRNA-target RNA interactions, which contributes to the strong regulatory effects of conserved miRNAs7,8. Our study presents the first case of a pathogenic gain-of-function miRNA mutation and provides molecular insight into neomorphic actions of emerging and/or mutant miRNAs.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31358993,CELA2A mutations predispose to early-onset atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome and affect plasma insulin and platelet activation.,"Factors that underlie the clustering of metabolic syndrome traits are not fully known. We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in kindreds with extreme phenotypes of early-onset atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome, and identified novel loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the pancreatic elastase chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 2A (CELA2A). We further show that CELA2A is a circulating enzyme that reduces platelet hyperactivation, triggers both insulin secretion and degradation, and increases insulin sensitivity.

31495489,Loss of SMPD4 Causes a Developmental Disorder Characterized by Microcephaly and Congenital Arthrogryposis.,"Sphingomyelinases generate ceramide from sphingomyelin as a second messenger in intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. Children from 12 unrelated families presented with microcephaly, simplified gyral pattern of the cortex, hypomyelination, cerebellar hypoplasia, congenital arthrogryposis, and early fetal/postnatal demise. Genomic analysis revealed bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in SMPD4, coding for the neutral sphingomyelinase-3 (nSMase-3/SMPD4). Overexpression of human Myc-tagged SMPD4 showed localization both to the outer nuclear envelope and the ER and additionally revealed interactions with several nuclear pore complex proteins by proteomics analysis. Fibroblasts from affected individuals showed ER cisternae abnormalities, suspected for increased autophagy, and were more susceptible to apoptosis under stress conditions, while treatment with siSMPD4 caused delayed cell cycle progression. Our data show that SMPD4 links homeostasis of membrane sphingolipids to cell fate by regulating the cross-talk between the ER and the outer nuclear envelope, while its loss reveals a pathogenic mechanism in microcephaly.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31130282,Activating Mutations of RRAS2 Are a Rare Cause of Noonan Syndrome.,"Aberrant signaling through pathways controlling cell response to extracellular stimuli constitutes a central theme in disorders affecting development. Signaling through RAS and the MAPK cascade controls a variety of cell decisions in response to cytokines, hormones, and growth factors, and its upregulation causes Noonan syndrome (NS), a developmental disorder whose major features include a distinctive facies, a wide spectrum of cardiac defects, short stature, variable cognitive impairment, and predisposition to malignancies. NS is genetically heterogeneous, and mutations in more than ten genes have been reported to underlie this disorder. Despite the large number of genes implicated, about 10%-20% of affected individuals with a clinical diagnosis of NS do not have mutations in known RASopathy-associated genes, indicating that additional unidentified genes contribute to the disease, when mutated. By using a mixed strategy of functional candidacy and exome sequencing, we identify RRAS2 as a gene implicated in NS in six unrelated subjects/families. We show that the NS-causing RRAS2 variants affect highly conserved residues localized around the nucleotide binding pocket of the GTPase and are predicted to variably affect diverse aspects of RRAS2 biochemical behavior, including nucleotide binding, GTP hydrolysis, and interaction with effectors. Additionally, all pathogenic variants increase activation of the MAPK cascade and variably impact cell morphology and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Finally, we provide a characterization of the clinical phenotype associated with RRAS2 mutations.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31303264,"Mutations in ANAPC1, Encoding a Scaffold Subunit of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex, Cause Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome Type 1.","Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by poikiloderma, sparse hair, short stature, and skeletal anomalies. Type 2 RTS, which is defined by the presence of bi-allelic mutations in RECQL4, is characterized by increased cancer susceptibility and skeletal anomalies, whereas the genetic basis of RTS type 1, which is associated with juvenile cataracts, is unknown. We studied ten individuals, from seven families, who had RTS type 1 and identified a deep intronic splicing mutation of the ANAPC1 gene, a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), in all affected individuals, either in the homozygous state or in trans with another mutation. Fibroblast studies showed that the intronic mutation causes the activation of a 95Â bp pseudoexon, leading to mRNAs with premature termination codons and nonsense-mediated decay, decreased ANAPC1 protein levels, and prolongation of interphase. Interestingly, mice that were heterozygous for a knockout mutation have an increased incidence of cataracts. Our results demonstrate that deficiency in the APC/C is a cause of RTS type 1 and suggest a possible link between the APC/C and RECQL4 helicase because both proteins are involved in DNA repair and replication.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29572253,"Inframe deletion of human ESPN is associated with deafness, vestibulopathy and vision impairment.","BACKGROUND:Usher syndrome (USH) is a neurosensory disorder characterised by deafness, variable vestibular areflexia and vision loss. The aim of the study was to identify the genetic defect in a Pakistani family (PKDF1051) segregating USH. METHODS:Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed by using an Illumina linkage array followed by Sanger and exome sequencing. Heterologous cells and mouse organ of Corti explant-based transfection assays were used for functional evaluations. Detailed clinical evaluations were performed to characterise the USH phenotype. RESULTS:Through homozygosity mapping, we genetically linked the USH phenotype segregating in family PKDF1051 to markers on chromosome 1p36.32-p36.22. The locus was designated USH1M. Using a combination of Sanger sequencing and exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous 18 base pair inframe deletion in ESPN. Variants of ESPN, encoding the actin-bundling protein espin, have been previously associated with deafness and vestibular areflexia in humans with no apparent visual deficits. Our functional studies in heterologous cells and in mouse organ of Corti explant cultures revealed that the six deleted residues in affected individuals of family PKDF1051 are essential for the actin bundling function of espin demonstrated by ultracentrifugation actin binding and bundling assays. Funduscopic examination of the affected individuals of family PKDF1051 revealed irregular retinal contour, temporal flecks and disc pallor in both eyes. ERG revealed diminished rod photoreceptor function among affected individuals. CONCLUSION:Our study uncovers an additional USH gene, assigns the USH1 phenotype to a variant of ESPN and provides a 12th molecular component to the USH proteome.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
28067622,A homozygous FITM2 mutation causes a deafness-dystonia syndrome with motor regression and signs of ichthyosis and sensory neuropathy.,"A consanguineous family from Pakistan was ascertained to have a novel deafness-dystonia syndrome with motor regression, ichthyosis-like features and signs of sensory neuropathy. By applying a combined strategy of linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing in the presented family, a homozygous nonsense mutation, c.4G>T (p.Glu2*), in FITM2 was identified. FITM2 and its paralog FITM1 constitute an evolutionary conserved protein family involved in partitioning of triglycerides into cellular lipid droplets. Despite the role of FITM2 in neutral lipid storage and metabolism, no indications for lipodystrophy were observed in the affected individuals. In order to obtain independent evidence for the involvement of FITM2 in the human pathology, downregulation of the single Fitm ortholog, CG10671, in Drosophila melanogaster was pursued using RNA interference. Characteristics of the syndrome, including progressive locomotor impairment, hearing loss and disturbed sensory functions, were recapitulated in Drosophila, which supports the causative nature of the FITM2 mutation. Mutation-based genetic counseling can now be provided to the family and insight is obtained into the potential impact of genetic variation in FITM2.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31332380,"Noncoding CGG repeat expansions in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, oculopharyngodistal myopathy and an overlapping disease.","Noncoding repeat expansions cause various neuromuscular diseases, including myotonic dystrophies, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome, some spinocerebellar ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsies. Inspired by the striking similarities in the clinical and neuroimaging findings between neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome caused by noncoding CGG repeat expansions in FMR1, we directly searched for repeat expansion mutations and identified noncoding CGG repeat expansions in NBPF19 (NOTCH2NLC) as the causative mutations for NIID. Further prompted by the similarities in the clinical and neuroimaging findings with NIID, we identified similar noncoding CGG repeat expansions in two other diseases: oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy and oculopharyngodistal myopathy, in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 and LRP12, respectively. These findings expand our knowledge of the clinical spectra of diseases caused by expansions of the same repeat motif, and further highlight how directly searching for expanded repeats can help identify mutations underlying diseases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31204009,RINT1 Bi-allelic Variations Cause Infantile-Onset Recurrent Acute Liver Failure and Skeletal Abnormalities.,"Pediatric acute liver failure (ALF) is life threatening with genetic, immunologic, and environmental etiologies. Approximately half of all cases remain unexplained. Recurrent ALF (RALF) in infants describes repeated episodes of severe liver injury with recovery of hepatic function between crises. We describe bi-allelic RINT1 alterations as the cause of a multisystem disorder including RALF and skeletal abnormalities. Three unrelated individuals with RALF onset ≤3 years of age have splice alterations at the same position (c.1333+1G>A or G>T) in trans with a missense (p.Ala368Thr or p.Leu370Pro) or in-frame deletion (p.Val618_Lys619del) in RINT1. ALF episodes are concomitant with fever/infection and not all individuals have complete normalization of liver function testing between episodes. Liver biopsies revealed nonspecific liver damage including fibrosis, steatosis, or mild increases in Kupffer cells. Skeletal imaging revealed abnormalities affecting the vertebrae and pelvis. Dermal fibroblasts showed splice-variant mediated skipping of exon 9 leading to an out-of-frame product and nonsense-mediated transcript decay. Fibroblasts also revealed decreased RINT1 protein, abnormal Golgi morphology, and impaired autophagic flux compared to control. RINT1 interacts with NBAS, recently implicated in RALF, and UVRAG, to facilitate Golgi-to-ER retrograde vesicle transport. During nutrient depletion or infection, Golgi-to-ER transport is suppressed and autophagy is promoted through UVRAG regulation by mTOR. Aberrant autophagy has been associated with the development of similar skeletal abnormalities and also with liver disease, suggesting that disruption of these RINT1 functions may explain the liver and skeletal findings. Clarifying the pathomechanism underlying this gene-disease relationship may inform therapeutic opportunities.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31178125,"Mutations in DNAH17, Encoding a Sperm-Specific Axonemal Outer Dynein Arm Heavy Chain, Cause Isolated Male Infertility Due to Asthenozoospermia.","Motile cilia and sperm flagella share an evolutionarily conserved axonemal structure. Their structural and/or functional defects are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disease characterized by chronic respiratory-tract infections and in which most males are infertile due to asthenozoospermia. Among the well-characterized axonemal protein complexes, the outer dynein arms (ODAs), through ATPase activity of their heavy chains (HCs), play a major role for cilia and flagella beating. However, the contribution of the different HCs (γ-type: DNAH5 and DNAH8 and β-type: DNAH9, DNAH11, and DNAH17) in ODAs from both organelles is unknown. By analyzing five male individuals who consulted for isolated infertility and displayed a loss of ODAs in their sperm cells but not in their respiratory cells, we identified bi-allelic mutations in DNAH17. The isolated infertility phenotype prompted us to compare the protein composition of ODAs in the sperm and ciliary axonemes from control individuals. We show that DNAH17 and DNAH8, but not DNAH5, DNAH9, or DNAH11, colocalize with α-tubulin along the sperm axoneme, whereas the reverse picture is observed in respiratory cilia, thus explaining the phenotype restricted to sperm cells. We also demonstrate the loss of function associated with DNAH17 mutations in two unrelated individuals by performing immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses on sperm cells; these analyses indicated the absence of DNAH17 and DNAH8, whereas DNAH2 and DNALI, two inner dynein arm components, were present. Overall, this study demonstrates that mutations in DNAH17 are responsible for isolated male infertility and provides information regarding ODA composition in human spermatozoa.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31564437,Autosomal-Recessive Mutations in MESD Cause Osteogenesis Imperfecta.,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) comprises a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal fragility diseases. Here, we report on five independent families with a progressively deforming type of OI, in whom we identified four homozygous truncation or frameshift mutations in MESD. Affected individuals had recurrent fractures and at least one had oligodontia. MESD encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein for the canonical Wingless-related integration site (WNT) signaling receptors LRP5 and LRP6. Because complete absence of MESD causes embryonic lethality in mice, we hypothesized that the OI-associated mutations are hypomorphic alleles since these mutations occur downstream of the chaperone activity domain but upstream of ER-retention domain. This would be consistent with the clinical phenotypes of skeletal fragility and oligodontia in persons deficient for LRP5 and LRP6, respectively. When we expressed wild-type (WT) and mutant MESD in HEK293T cells, we detected WT MESD in cell lysate but not in conditioned medium, whereas the converse was true for mutant MESD. We observed that both WT and mutant MESD retained the ability to chaperone LRP5. Thus, OI-associated MESD mutations produce hypomorphic alleles whose failure to remain within the ER significantly reduces but does not completely eliminate LRP5 and LRP6 trafficking. Since these individuals have no eye abnormalities (which occur in individuals completely lacking LRP5) and have neither limb nor brain patterning defects (both of which occur in mice completely lacking LRP6), we infer that bone mass accrual and dental patterning are more sensitive to reduced canonical WNT signaling than are other developmental processes. Biologic agents that can increase LRP5 and LRP6-mediated WNT signaling could benefit individuals with MESD-associated OI.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31412107,Agenesis of the putamen and globus pallidus caused by recessive mutations in the homeobox gene GSX2.,"Basal ganglia are subcortical grey nuclei that play essential roles in controlling voluntary movements, cognition and emotion. While basal ganglia dysfunction is observed in many neurodegenerative or metabolic disorders, congenital malformations are rare. In particular, dysplastic basal ganglia are part of the malformative spectrum of tubulinopathies and X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, but neurodevelopmental syndromes characterized by basal ganglia agenesis are not known to date. We ascertained two unrelated children (both female) presenting with spastic tetraparesis, severe generalized dystonia and intellectual impairment, sharing a unique brain malformation characterized by agenesis of putamina and globi pallidi, dysgenesis of the caudate nuclei, olfactory bulbs hypoplasia, and anomaly of the diencephalic-mesencephalic junction with abnormal corticospinal tract course. Whole-exome sequencing identified two novel homozygous variants, c.26C>A; p.(S9*) and c.752A>G; p.(Q251R) in the GSX2 gene, a member of the family of homeobox transcription factors, which are key regulators of embryonic development. GSX2 is highly expressed in neural progenitors of the lateral and median ganglionic eminences, two protrusions of the ventral telencephalon from which the basal ganglia and olfactory tubercles originate, where it promotes neurogenesis while negatively regulating oligodendrogenesis. The truncating variant resulted in complete loss of protein expression, while the missense variant affected a highly conserved residue of the homeobox domain, was consistently predicted as pathogenic by bioinformatic tools, resulted in reduced protein expression and caused impaired structural stability of the homeobox domain and weaker interaction with DNA according to molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, the nuclear localization of the mutant protein in transfected cells was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type protein. Expression studies on both patients' fibroblasts demonstrated reduced expression of GSX2 itself, likely due to altered transcriptional self-regulation, as well as significant expression changes of related genes such as ASCL1 and PAX6. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed a global deregulation in genes implicated in apoptosis and immunity, two broad pathways known to be involved in brain development. This is the first report of the clinical phenotype and molecular basis associated to basal ganglia agenesis in humans.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
30464055,"SEC31A mutation affects ER homeostasis, causing a neurological syndrome.","BACKGROUND:Consanguineous kindred presented with an autosomal recessive syndrome of intrauterine growth retardation, marked developmental delay, spastic quadriplegia with profound contractures, pseudobulbar palsy with recurrent aspirations, epilepsy, dysmorphism, neurosensory deafness and optic nerve atrophy with no eye fixation. Affected individuals died by the age of 4. Brain MRI demonstrated microcephaly, semilobar holoprosencephaly and agenesis of corpus callosum. We aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of this disease. METHODS:Genome-wide linkage analysis combined with whole exome sequencing were performed to identify disease-causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated in fruit flies null mutant for the Drosophila SEC31A orthologue. SEC31A knockout SH-SY5Y and HEK293T cell-lines were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and studied through qRT-PCR, immunoblotting and viability assays. RESULTS:Through genetic studies, we identified a disease-associated homozygous nonsense mutation in SEC31A. We demonstrate that SEC31A is ubiquitously expressed, and that the mutation triggers nonsense-mediated decay of its transcript, comprising a practical null mutation. Similar to the human disease phenotype, knockdown SEC31A flies had defective brains and early lethality. Moreover, in line with SEC31A encoding one of the two coating layers comprising the Coat protein complex II (COP-II) complex, trafficking newly synthesised proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated SEC31A null mutant cells demonstrated reduced viability through upregulation of ER-stress pathways. CONCLUSION:We demonstrate through human and Drosophila genetic and in vitro molecular studies, that a severe neurological syndrome is caused by a null mutation in SEC31A, reducing cell viability through enhanced ER-stress response, in line with SEC31A's role in the COP-II complex.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31327508,"De Novo Variants in WDR37 Are Associated with Epilepsy, Colobomas, Dysmorphism, Developmental Delay, Intellectual Disability, and Cerebellar Hypoplasia.","WD40 repeat-containing proteins form a large family of proteins present in all eukaryotes. Here, we identified five pediatric probands with de novo variants in WDR37, which encodes a member of the WD40 repeat protein family. Two probands shared one variant and the others have variants in nearby amino acids outside the WD40 repeats. The probands exhibited shared phenotypes of epilepsy, colobomas, facial dysmorphology reminiscent of CHARGE syndrome, developmental delay and intellectual disability, and cerebellar hypoplasia. The WDR37 protein is highly conserved in vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms and is currently not associated with a human disease. We generated a null allele of the single Drosophila ortholog to gain functional insights and replaced the coding region of the fly gene CG12333/wdr37 with GAL4. These flies are homozygous viable but display severe bang sensitivity, a phenotype associated with seizures in flies. Additionally, the mutant flies fall when climbing the walls of the vials, suggesting a defect in grip strength, and repeat the cycle of climbing and falling. Similar to wall clinging defect, mutant males often lose grip of the female abdomen during copulation. These phenotypes are rescued by using the GAL4 in the CG12333/wdr37 locus to drive the UAS-human reference WDR37 cDNA. The two variants found in three human subjects failed to rescue these phenotypes, suggesting that these alleles severely affect the function of this protein. Taken together, our data suggest that variants in WDR37 underlie a novel syndromic neurological disorder.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31422817,Rare De Novo Missense Variants in RNA Helicase DDX6 Cause Intellectual Disability and Dysmorphic Features and Lead to P-Body Defects and RNA Dysregulation.,"The human RNA helicase DDX6 is an essential component of membrane-less organelles called processing bodies (PBs). PBs are involved in mRNA metabolic processes including translational repression via coordinated storage of mRNAs. Previous studies in human cell lines have implicated altered DDX6 in molecular and cellular dysfunction, but clinical consequences and pathogenesis in humans have yet to be described. Here, we report the identification of five rare de novo missense variants in DDX6 in probands presenting with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and similar dysmorphic features including telecanthus, epicanthus, arched eyebrows, and low-set ears. All five missense variants (p.His372Arg, p.Arg373Gln, p.Cys390Arg, p.Thr391Ile, and p.Thr391Pro) are located in two conserved motifs of the RecA-2 domain of DDX6 involved in RNA binding, helicase activity, and protein-partner binding. We use functional studies to demonstrate that the first variants identified (p.Arg373Gln and p.Cys390Arg) cause significant defects in PB assembly in primary fibroblast and model human cell lines. These variants' interactions with several protein partners were also disrupted in immunoprecipitation assays. Further investigation via complementation assays included the additional variants p.Thr391Ile and p.Thr391Pro, both of which, similarly to p.Arg373Gln and p.Cys390Arg, demonstrated significant defects in P-body assembly. Complementing these molecular findings, modeling of the variants on solved protein structures showed distinct spatial clustering near known protein binding regions. Collectively, our clinical and molecular data describe a neurodevelopmental syndrome associated with pathogenic missense variants in DDX6. Additionally, we suggest DDX6 join the DExD/H-box genes DDX3X and DHX30 in an emerging class of neurodevelopmental disorders involving RNA helicases.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30701273,"ACTN2 mutations cause ""Multiple structured Core Disease"" (MsCD).","The identification of genes implicated in myopathies is essential for diagnosis and for revealing novel therapeutic targets. Here we characterize a novel subclass of congenital myopathy at the morphological, molecular, and functional level. Through exome sequencing, we identified de novo ACTN2 mutations, a missense and a deletion, in two unrelated patients presenting with progressive early-onset muscle weakness and respiratory involvement. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses of muscle biopsies revealed a distinctive pattern with the presence of muscle fibers containing small structured cores and jagged Z-lines. Deeper analysis of the missense mutation revealed mutant alpha-actinin-2 properly localized to the Z-line in differentiating myotubes and its level was not altered in muscle biopsy. Modelling of the disease in zebrafish and mice by exogenous expression of mutated alpha-actinin-2 recapitulated the abnormal muscle function and structure seen in the patients. Motor deficits were noted in zebrafish, and muscle force was impaired in isolated muscles from AAV-transduced mice. In both models, sarcomeric disorganization was evident, while expression of wild-type alpha-actinin-2 did not result in muscle anomalies. The murine muscles injected with mutant ACTN2 displayed cores and Z-line defects. Dominant ACTN2 mutations were previously associated with cardiomyopathies, and our data demonstrate that specific mutations in the well-known Z-line regulator alpha-actinin-2 can cause a skeletal muscle disorder.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"

METHODS:We studied 4 families (3 from Spain and 1 from Sweden) suffering from an autosomal dominant distal myopathy. Affected members showed adult onset asymmetric distal muscle weakness with initial involvement of ankle dorsiflexion later progressing also to proximal limb muscles. RESULTS:In all 3 Spanish families, we identified a unique missense variant in the ACTN2 gene cosegregating with the disease. The affected members of the Swedish family carry a different ACTN2 missense variant. INTERPRETATION:ACTN2 encodes for alpha actinin2, which is highly expressed in the sarcomeric Z-disk with a major structural and functional role.

31155282,Gain-of-Function Mutations in KCNN3 Encoding the Small-Conductance Ca2+-Activated K+ Channel SK3 Cause Zimmermann-Laband Syndrome.,"Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS) is characterized by coarse facial features with gingival enlargement, intellectual disability (ID), hypertrichosis, and hypoplasia or aplasia of nails and terminal phalanges. De novo missense mutations in KCNH1 and KCNK4, encoding K+ channels, have been identified in subjects with ZLS and ZLS-like phenotype, respectively. We report de novo missense variants in KCNN3 in three individuals with typical clinical features of ZLS. KCNN3 (SK3/KCa2.3) constitutes one of three members of the small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels that are part of a multiprotein complex consisting of the pore-forming channel subunits, the constitutively bound Ca2+ sensor calmodulin, protein kinase CK2, and protein phosphatase 2A. CK2 modulates Ca2+ sensitivity of the channels by phosphorylating SK-bound calmodulin. Patch-clamp whole-cell recordings of KCNN3 channel-expressing CHO cells demonstrated that disease-associated mutations result in gain of function of the mutant channels, characterized by increased Ca2+ sensitivity leading to faster and more complete activation of KCNN3 mutant channels. Pretreatment of cells with the CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole revealed basal inhibition of wild-type and mutant KCNN3 channels by CK2. Analogous experiments with the KCNN3 p.Val450Leu mutant previously identified in a family with portal hypertension indicated basal constitutive channel activity and thus a different gain-of-function mechanism compared to the ZLS-associated mutant channels. With the report on de novo KCNK4 mutations in subjects with facial dysmorphism, hypertrichosis, epilepsy, ID, and gingival overgrowth, we propose to combine the phenotypes caused by mutations in KCNH1, KCNK4, and KCNN3 in a group of neurological potassium channelopathies caused by an increase in K+ conductance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30639322,ZMIZ1 Variants Cause a Syndromic Neurodevelopmental Disorder.,"ZMIZ1 is a coactivator of several transcription factors, including p53, the androgen receptor, and NOTCH1. Here, we report 19 subjects with intellectual disability and developmental delay carrying variants in ZMIZ1. The associated features include growth failure, feeding difficulties, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and various other congenital malformations. Of these 19, 14 unrelated subjects carried de novo heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) or single-base insertions/deletions, 3 siblings harbored a heterozygous single-base insertion, and 2 subjects had a balanced translocation disrupting ZMIZ1 or involving a regulatory region of ZMIZ1. In total, we identified 13 point mutations that affect key protein regions, including a SUMO acceptor site, a central disordered alanine-rich motif, a proline-rich domain, and a transactivation domain. All identified variants were absent from all available exome and genome databases. In vitro, ZMIZ1 showed impaired coactivation of the androgen receptor. In vivo, overexpression of ZMIZ1 mutant alleles in developing mouse brains using in utero electroporation resulted in abnormal pyramidal neuron morphology, polarization, and positioning, underscoring the importance of ZMIZ1 in neural development and supporting mutations in ZMIZ1 as the cause of a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
17185460,Molecular basis of glutathione reductase deficiency in human blood cells.,"Hereditary glutathione reductase (GR) deficiency was found in only 2 cases when testing more than 15 000 blood samples. We have investigated the blood cells of 2 patients (1a and 1b) in a previously described family suffering from favism and cataract and of a novel patient (2) presenting with severe neonatal jaundice. Red blood cells and leukocytes of the patients in family 1 did not contain any GR activity, and the GR protein was undetectable by Western blotting. Owing to a 2246-bp deletion in the patients' DNA, translated GR is expected to lack almost the complete dimerization domain, which results in unstable and inactive enzyme. The red blood cells from patient 2 did not exhibit GR activity either, but the patient's leukocytes contained some residual activity that correlated with a weak protein expression. Patient 2 was found to be a compound heterozygote, with a premature stop codon on one allele and a substitution of glycine 330, a highly conserved residue in the superfamily of NAD(P)H-dependent disulfide reductases, into alanine on the other allele. Studies on recombinant GR G330A revealed a drastically impaired thermostability of the protein.

31217582,Noncoding deletions reveal a gene that is critical for intestinal function.,"Large-scale genome sequencing is poised to provide a substantial increase in the rate of discovery of disease-associated mutations, but the functional interpretation of such mutations remains challenging. Here we show that deletions of a sequence on human chromosome 16 that we term the intestine-critical region (ICR) cause intractable congenital diarrhoea in infants1,2. Reporter assays in transgenic mice show that the ICR contains a regulatory sequence that activates transcription during the development of the gastrointestinal system. Targeted deletion of the ICR in mice caused symptoms that recapitulated the human condition. Transcriptome analysis revealed that an unannotated open reading frame (Percc1) flanks the regulatory sequence, and the expression of this gene was lost in the developing gut of mice that lacked the ICR. Percc1-knockout mice displayed phenotypes similar to those observed upon ICR deletion in mice and patients, whereas an ICR-driven Percc1 transgene was sufficient to rescue the phenotypes found in mice that lacked the ICR. Together, our results identify a gene that is critical for intestinal function and underscore the need for targeted in vivo studies to interpret the growing number of clinical genetic findings that do not affect known protein-coding genes.",research-article; journal article

Using whole exome sequencing, we identified biallelic DMXL2 mutations in three sibling pairs with Ohtahara syndrome, belonging to three unrelated families. Siblings in Family 1 were compound heterozygous for the c.5135C>T (p.Ala1712Val) missense substitution and the c.4478C>G (p.Ser1493*) nonsense substitution; in Family 2 were homozygous for the c.4478C>A (p.Ser1493*) nonsense substitution and in Family 3 were homozygous for the c.7518-1G>A (p.Trp2507Argfs*4) substitution. The severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy manifested from the first day of life and was associated with deafness, mild peripheral polyneuropathy and dysmorphic features. Early brain MRI investigations in the first months of life revealed thin corpus callosum with brain hypomyelination in all. Follow-up MRI scans in three patients revealed progressive moderate brain shrinkage with leukoencephalopathy. Five patients died within the first 9 years of life and none achieved developmental, communicative or motor skills following birth. These clinical findings are consistent with a developmental brain disorder that begins in the prenatal brain, prevents neural connections from reaching the expected stages at birth, and follows a progressive course. DMXL2 is highly expressed in the brain and at synaptic terminals, regulates v-ATPase assembly and activity and participates in intracellular signalling pathways; however, its functional role is far from complete elucidation. Expression analysis in patient-derived skin fibroblasts demonstrated absence of the DMXL2 protein, revealing a loss of function phenotype. Patients' fibroblasts also exhibited an increased LysoTracker® signal associated with decreased endolysosomal markers and degradative processes. Defective endolysosomal homeostasis was accompanied by impaired autophagy, revealed by lower LC3II signal, accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, and autophagy receptor p62, with morphological alterations of the autolysosomal structures on electron microscopy. Altered lysosomal homeostasis and defective autophagy were recapitulated in Dmxl2-silenced mouse hippocampal neurons, which exhibited impaired neurite elongation and synaptic loss. Impaired lysosomal function and autophagy caused by biallelic DMXL2 mutations affect neuronal development and synapse formation and result in Ohtahara syndrome with profound developmental impairment and reduced life expectancy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31413122,Biallelic mutations in CFAP65 lead to severe asthenoteratospermia due to acrosome hypoplasia and flagellum malformations.,"BACKGROUND:The genetic causes for most male infertility due to severe asthenozoospermia remain unclear. OBJECTIVE:Our objective was to identify unknown genetic factors in 47 patients with severe asthenozoospermia from 45 unrelated Chinese families. METHODS:We performed whole exome sequencing of 47 individuals with severe asthenozoospermia from 45 unrelated families. Mutation screening was performed in a control cohort of 637 individuals, including 219 with oligoasthenospermia, 195 with non-obstructive azoospermia and 223 fertile controls. Ultrastructural and immunostaining analyses of patients' spermatozoa were performed to characterise the effect of variants. RESULTS:One homozygous non-sense mutation (NM_194302, c.G5341T:p.E1781X), two compound heterozygous mutations (c.C2284T:p.R762X and c.1751delC:p.P584fs) and two compound heterozygous mutations (c.5714_5721del:p.L1905fs and c.C3021A:p.N1007K) were identified in CFAP65 of three individuals with completely immotile spermatozoa, respectively. No biallelic deleterious variants of CFAP65 were detected in the control cohort of 637 individuals. Ultrastructural and immunostaining analyses of spermatozoa from two patients showed highly aberrant sperm morphology with severe defects such as acrosome hypoplasia, disruption of the mitochondrial sheath and absence of the central pair complex. CONCLUSION:To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report that CFAP65 mutations may cause spermatozoa to be completely immotile.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31564433,Bi-allelic Variants in METTL5 Cause Autosomal-Recessive Intellectual Disability and Microcephaly.,"Intellectual disability (ID) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorder, characterized by limited cognitive abilities and impaired adaptive behaviors. In recent years, exome sequencing (ES) has been instrumental in deciphering the genetic etiology of ID. Here, through ES of a large cohort of individuals with ID, we identified two bi-allelic frameshift variants in METTL5, c.344_345delGA (p.Arg115Asnfs∗19) and c.571_572delAA (p.Lys191Valfs∗10), in families of Pakistani and Yemenite origin. Both of these variants were segregating with moderate to severe ID, microcephaly, and various facial dysmorphisms, in an autosomal-recessive fashion. METTL5 is a member of the methyltransferase-like protein family, which encompasses proteins with a seven-beta-strand methyltransferase domain. We found METTL5 expression in various substructures of rodent and human brains and METTL5 protein to be enriched in the nucleus and synapses of the hippocampal neurons. Functional studies of these truncating variants in transiently transfected orthologous cells and cultured hippocampal rat neurons revealed no effect on the localization of METTL5 but alter its level of expression. Our in silico analysis and 3D modeling simulation predict disruption of METTL5 function by both variants. Finally, mettl5 knockdown in zebrafish resulted in microcephaly, recapitulating the human phenotype. This study provides evidence that biallelic variants in METTL5 cause ID and microcephaly in humans and highlights the essential role of METTL5 in brain development and neuronal function.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29983323,De Novo Mutation in Genes Regulating Neural Stem Cell Fate in Human Congenital Hydrocephalus.,"Congenital hydrocephalus (CH), featuring markedly enlarged brain ventricles, is thought to arise from failed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homeostasis and is treated with lifelong surgical CSF shunting with substantial morbidity. CH pathogenesis is poorly understood. Exome sequencing of 125 CH trios and 52 additional probands identified three genes with significant burden of rare damaging de novo or transmitted mutations: TRIM71 (p = 2.15 × 10-7), SMARCC1 (p = 8.15 × 10-10), and PTCH1 (p = 1.06 × 10-6). Additionally, two de novo duplications were identified at the SHH locus, encoding the PTCH1 ligand (p = 1.2 × 10-4). Together, these probands account for ∼10% of studied cases. Strikingly, all four genes are required for neural tube development and regulate ventricular zone neural stem cell fate. These results implicate impaired neurogenesis (rather than active CSF accumulation) in the pathogenesis of a subset of CH patients, with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic ramifications.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31621862,CFAP70 mutations lead to male infertility due to severe astheno-teratozoospermia. A case report.,"The use of high-throughput sequencing techniques has allowed the identification of numerous mutations in genes responsible for severe astheno-teratozoospermia due to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF). However, more than half of the analysed cases remain unresolved suggesting that many yet uncharacterised gene defects account for this phenotype. Based on whole-exome sequencing data from a large cohort of 167 MMAF-affected subjects, we identified two unrelated affected individuals carrying a homozygous deleterious mutation in CFAP70, a gene not previously linked to the MMAF phenotype. One patient had a homozygous splice variant c.1723-1G>T, altering a consensus splice acceptor site of CFAP70 exon 16, and one had a likely deleterious missense variant in exon 3 (p.Phe60Ile). The CFAP70 gene encodes a regulator protein of the outer dynein arms (ODA) strongly expressed in the human testis. In the sperm cells from the patient carrying the splice variant, immunofluorescence (IF) experiments confirmed the absence of the protein in the sperm flagellum. Moreover, IF analysis showed the absence of markers for the ODAs and the central pair complex of the axoneme. Interestingly, whereas CFAP70 staining was present in sperm cells from patients with mutations in the three other MMAF-related genes ARMC2, FSIP2 and CFAP43, we observed an absence of staining in sperm cells from patients mutated in the WDR66 gene, suggesting a possible interaction between two different axonemal components. In conclusion, this work provides the first evidence that loss of CFAP70 function causes MMAF and that ODA-related proteins may be crucial for the assembly and/or stability of the flagellum axoneme in addition to its motility.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
31201375,De novo variants in CNOT3 cause a variable neurodevelopmental disorder.,"As a result of exome-based sequencing work performed by the DDD study, de novo variants in CNOT3 have emerged as a newly recognised cause of a developmental disorder. This paper describes molecular and clinical details of 16 probands with developmental disorders and de novo CNOT3 variants. It is the first such description of the developmental phenotype associated with CNOT3 variants. Eight of these cases were discovered as part of the DDD study, while the other eight were found as a result of large-scale sequencing work performed by other groups. A highly specific phenotype was not recognised in these 16 cases. The most consistent phenotypic features seen in subjects with de novo variants in CNOT3 were hypotonia, relatively small stature, developmental delay, behavioural problems and intellectual disability. There is no easily recognisable facial phenotype, but some common dysmorphic features such as anteverted nares, thin upper lip and low set eyebrows were shared among some of the probands. Haploinsufficiency appears to be the most likely mechanism of action, with eight cases found to have protein-truncating variants. Of the other eight cases (all missense variants), three share an amino acid substitution at the same position which may therefore represent an important functional domain.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31488579,"ZCCHC8, the nuclear exosome targeting component, is mutated in familial pulmonary fibrosis and is required for telomerase RNA maturation.","Short telomere syndromes manifest as familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; they are the most common premature aging disorders. We used genome-wide linkage to identify heterozygous loss of function of ZCCHC8, a zinc-knuckle containing protein, as a cause of autosomal dominant pulmonary fibrosis. ZCCHC8 associated with TR and was required for telomerase function. In ZCCHC8 knockout cells and in mutation carriers, genomically extended telomerase RNA (TR) accumulated at the expense of mature TR, consistent with a role for ZCCHC8 in mediating TR 3' end targeting to the nuclear RNA exosome. We generated Zcchc8-null mice and found that heterozygotes, similar to human mutation carriers, had TR insufficiency but an otherwise preserved transcriptome. In contrast, Zcchc8-/- mice developed progressive and fatal neurodevelopmental pathology with features of a ciliopathy. The Zcchc8-/- brain transcriptome was highly dysregulated, showing accumulation and 3' end misprocessing of other low-abundance RNAs, including those encoding cilia components as well as the intronless replication-dependent histones. Our data identify a novel cause of human short telomere syndromes-familial pulmonary fibrosis and uncover nuclear exosome targeting as an essential 3' end maturation mechanism that vertebrate TR shares with replication-dependent histones.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31585108,"Bi-allelic Loss of Human APC2, Encoding Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein 2, Leads to Lissencephaly, Subcortical Heterotopia, and Global Developmental Delay.","Lissencephaly is a severe brain malformation in which failure of neuronal migration results in agyria or pachygyria and in which the brain surface appears unusually smooth. It is often associated with microcephaly, profound intellectual disability, epilepsy, and impaired motor abilities. Twenty-two genes are associated with lissencephaly, accounting for approximately 80% of disease. Here we report on 12 individuals with a unique form of lissencephaly; these individuals come from eight unrelated families and have bi-allelic mutations in APC2, encoding adenomatous polyposis coli protein 2. Brain imaging studies demonstrate extensive posterior predominant lissencephaly, similar to PAFAH1B1-associated lissencephaly, as well as co-occurrence of subcortical heterotopia posterior to the caudate nuclei, ""ribbon-like"" heterotopia in the posterior frontal region, and dysplastic in-folding of the mesial occipital cortex. The established role of APC2 in integrating the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons to mediate cellular morphological changes suggests shared function with other lissencephaly-encoded cytoskeletal proteins such as α-N-catenin (CTNNA2) and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b regulatory subunit 1 (PAFAH1B1, also known as LIS1). Our findings identify APC2 as a radiographically distinguishable recessive form of lissencephaly.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
28846075,Dysfunction of the MDM2/p53 axis is linked to premature aging.,"The tumor suppressor p53, a master regulator of the cellular response to stress, is tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 via an autoregulatory feedback loop. In addition to its well-established role in tumorigenesis, p53 has also been associated with aging in mice. Several mouse models with aberrantly increased p53 activity display signs of premature aging. However, the relationship between dysfunction of the MDM2/p53 axis and human aging remains elusive. Here, we have identified an antiterminating homozygous germline mutation in MDM2 in a patient affected by a segmental progeroid syndrome. We show that this mutation abrogates MDM2 activity, thereby resulting in enhanced levels and stability of p53. Analysis of the patient's primary cells, genome-edited cells, and in vitro and in vivo analyses confirmed the MDM2 mutation's aberrant regulation of p53 activity. Functional data from a zebrafish model further demonstrated that mutant Mdm2 was unable to rescue a p53-induced apoptotic phenotype. Altogether, our findings indicate that mutant MDM2 is a likely driver of the observed segmental form of progeria.",research-article; journal article
29917077,USMG5 Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation impairs mitochondrial complex V dimerization and ATP synthesis.,"Leigh syndrome is a frequent, heterogeneous pediatric presentation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disease, manifesting with psychomotor retardation and necrotizing lesions in brain deep gray matter. OXPHOS occurs at the inner mitochondrial membrane through the integrated activity of five protein complexes, of which complex V (CV) functions in a dimeric form to directly generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mutations in several different structural CV subunits cause Leigh syndrome; however, dimerization defects have not been associated with human disease. We report four Leigh syndrome subjects from three unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish families harboring a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.87 + 1G>C) in a novel CV subunit disease gene, USMG5. The Ashkenazi population allele frequency is 0.57%. This mutation produces two USMG5 transcripts, wild-type and lacking exon 3. Fibroblasts from two Leigh syndrome probands had reduced wild-type USMG5 mRNA expression and undetectable protein. The mutation did not alter monomeric CV expression, but reduced both CV dimer expression and ATP synthesis rate. Rescue with wild-type USMG5 cDNA in proband fibroblasts restored USMG5 protein, increased CV dimerization and enhanced ATP production rate. These data demonstrate that a recurrent USMG5 splice-site founder mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population causes autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome by reduction of CV dimerization and ATP synthesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31607425,"Bi-allelic Variants in IQSEC1 Cause Intellectual Disability, Developmental Delay, and Short Stature.","We report two consanguineous families with probands that exhibit intellectual disability, developmental delay, short stature, aphasia, and hypotonia in which homozygous non-synonymous variants were identified in IQSEC1 (GenBank: NM_001134382.3). In a Pakistani family, the IQSEC1 segregating variant is c.1028C>T (p.Thr343Met), while in a Saudi Arabian family the variant is c.962G>A (p.Arg321Gln). IQSEC1-3 encode guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the small GTPase ARF6 and their loss affects a variety of actin-dependent cellular processes, including AMPA receptor trafficking at synapses. The ortholog of IQSECs in the fly is schizo and its loss affects growth cone guidance at the midline in the CNS, also an actin-dependent process. Overexpression of the reference IQSEC1 cDNA in wild-type flies is lethal, but overexpression of the two variant IQSEC1 cDNAs did not affect viability. Loss of schizo caused embryonic lethality that could be rescued to 2nd instar larvae by moderate expression of the human reference cDNA. However, the p.Arg321Gln and p.Thr343Met variants failed to rescue embryonic lethality. These data indicate that the variants behave as loss-of-function mutations. We also show that schizo in photoreceptors is required for phototransduction. Finally, mice with a conditional Iqsec1 deletion in cortical neurons exhibited an increased density of dendritic spines with an immature morphology. The phenotypic similarity of the affecteds and the functional experiments in flies and mice indicate that IQSEC1 variants are the cause of a recessive disease with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and short stature, and that axonal guidance and dendritic projection defects as well as dendritic spine dysgenesis may underlie disease pathogenesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31587869,Heterozygous Variants in the Mechanosensitive Ion Channel TMEM63A Result in Transient Hypomyelination during Infancy.,"Mechanically activated (MA) ion channels convert physical forces into electrical signals. Despite the importance of this function, the involvement of mechanosensitive ion channels in human disease is poorly understood. Here we report heterozygous missense mutations in the gene encoding the MA ion channel TMEM63A that result in an infantile disorder resembling a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. Four unrelated individuals presented with congenital nystagmus, motor delay, and deficient myelination on serial scans in infancy, prompting the diagnosis of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher (like) disease. Genomic sequencing revealed that all four individuals carry heterozygous missense variants in the pore-forming domain of TMEM63A. These variants were confirmed to have arisen de novo in three of the four individuals. While the physiological role of TMEM63A is incompletely understood, it is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes and it has recently been shown to be a MA ion channel. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrated that each of the modeled variants result in strongly attenuated stretch-activated currents when expressed in naive cells. Unexpectedly, the clinical evolution of all four individuals has been surprisingly favorable, with substantial improvements in neurological signs and developmental progression. In the three individuals with follow-up scans after 4 years of age, the myelin deficit had almost completely resolved. Our results suggest a previously unappreciated role for mechanosensitive ion channels in myelin development.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
25048963,MCIDAS mutations result in a mucociliary clearance disorder with reduced generation of multiple motile cilia.,"Reduced generation of multiple motile cilia (RGMC) is a rare mucociliary clearance disorder. Affected persons suffer from recurrent infections of upper and lower airways because of highly reduced numbers of multiple motile respiratory cilia. Here we report recessive loss-of-function and missense mutations in MCIDAS-encoding Multicilin, which was shown to promote the early steps of multiciliated cell differentiation in Xenopus. MCIDAS mutant respiratory epithelial cells carry only one or two cilia per cell, which lack ciliary motility-related proteins (DNAH5; CCDC39) as seen in primary ciliary dyskinesia. Consistent with this finding, FOXJ1-regulating axonemal motor protein expression is absent in respiratory cells of MCIDAS mutant individuals. CCNO, when mutated known to cause RGMC, is also absent in MCIDAS mutant respiratory cells, consistent with its downstream activity. Thus, our findings identify Multicilin as a key regulator of CCNO/FOXJ1 for human multiciliated cell differentiation, and highlight the 5q11 region containing CCNO and MCIDAS as a locus underlying RGMC.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
21654732,A dominant mutation in RPE65 identified by whole-exome sequencing causes retinitis pigmentosa with choroidal involvement.,"Linkage testing using Affymetrix 6.0 SNP Arrays mapped the disease locus in TCD-G, an Irish family with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), to an 8.8 Mb region on 1p31. Of 50 known genes in the region, 11 candidates, including RPE65 and PDE4B, were sequenced using di-deoxy capillary electrophoresis. Simultaneously, a subset of family members was analyzed using Agilent SureSelect All Exome capture, followed by sequencing on an Illumina GAIIx platform. Candidate gene and exome sequencing resulted in the identification of an Asp477Gly mutation in exon 13 of the RPE65 gene tracking with the disease in TCD-G. All coding exons of genes not sequenced to sufficient depth by next generation sequencing were sequenced by di-deoxy sequencing. No other potential disease-causing variants were found to segregate with disease in TCD-G. The Asp477Gly mutation was not present in Irish controls, but was found in a second Irish family provisionally diagnosed with choroideremia, bringing the combined maximum two-point LOD score to 5.3. Mutations in RPE65 are a known cause of recessive Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and recessive RP, but no dominant mutations have been reported. Protein modeling suggests that the Asp477Gly mutation may destabilize protein folding, and mutant RPE65 protein migrates marginally faster on SDS-PAGE, compared with wild type. Gene therapy for LCA patients with RPE65 mutations has shown great promise, raising the possibility of related therapies for dominant-acting mutations in this gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31630787,De Novo Mutations in FOXJ1 Result in a Motile Ciliopathy with Hydrocephalus and Randomization of Left/Right Body Asymmetry.,"Hydrocephalus is one of the most prevalent form of developmental central nervous system (CNS) malformations. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow depends on both heartbeat and body movement. Furthermore, it has been shown that CSF flow within and across brain ventricles depends on cilia motility of the ependymal cells lining the brain ventricles, which play a crucial role to maintain patency of the narrow sites of CSF passage during brain formation in mice. Using whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, we identified an autosomal-dominant cause of a distinct motile ciliopathy related to defective ciliogenesis of the ependymal cilia in six individuals. Heterozygous de novo mutations in FOXJ1, which encodes a well-known member of the forkhead transcription factors important for ciliogenesis of motile cilia, cause a motile ciliopathy that is characterized by hydrocephalus internus, chronic destructive airway disease, and randomization of left/right body asymmetry. Mutant respiratory epithelial cells are unable to generate a fluid flow and exhibit a reduced number of cilia per cell, as documented by high-speed video microscopy (HVMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunofluorescence analysis (IF). TEM and IF demonstrate mislocalized basal bodies. In line with this finding, the focal adhesion protein PTK2 displays aberrant localization in the cytoplasm of the mutant respiratory epithelial cells.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
29228025,A defect in the inner kinetochore protein CENPT causes a new syndrome of severe growth failure.,"Primordial growth failure has been linked to defects in the biology of cell division and replication. The complex processes involved in microtubule spindle formation, organization and function have emerged as a dominant patho-mechanism in these conditions. The majority of reported disease genes encode for centrosome and centriole proteins, leaving kinetochore proteins by which the spindle apparatus interacts with the chromosomes largely unaccounted for. We report a novel disease gene encoding the constitutive inner kinetochore member CENPT, which is involved in kinetochore targeting and assembly, resulting in severe growth failure in two siblings of a consanguineous family. We herein present studies on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that explain how genetic mutations in this gene lead to primordial growth failure. In both, affected human cell lines and a zebrafish knock-down model of Cenpt, we observed aberrations in cell division with abnormal accumulation of micronuclei and of nuclei with increased DNA content arising from incomplete and/or irregular chromosomal segregation. Our studies underscore the critical importance of kinetochore function for overall body growth and provide new insight into the cellular mechanisms implicated in the spectrum of these severe growth disorders.",research-article; journal article
29961568,De Novo Truncating Mutations in WASF1 Cause Intellectual Disability with Seizures.,"Next-generation sequencing has been invaluable in the elucidation of the genetic etiology of many subtypes of intellectual disability in recent years. Here, using exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we identified three de novo truncating mutations in WAS protein family member 1 (WASF1) in five unrelated individuals with moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic features and seizures. WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C>T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C>T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23). All three variants are predicted to partially or fully disrupt the C-terminal actin-binding WCA domain. Functional studies using fibroblast cells from two affected individuals with the c.1516C>T mutation showed a truncated WASF1 and a defect in actin remodeling. This study provides evidence that de novo heterozygous mutations in WASF1 cause a rare form of intellectual disability.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31353024,Haploinsufficiency of the Notch Ligand DLL1 Causes Variable Neurodevelopmental Disorders.,"Notch signaling is an established developmental pathway for brain morphogenesis. Given that Delta-like 1 (DLL1) is a ligand for the Notch receptor and that a few individuals with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and brain malformations have microdeletions encompassing DLL1, we hypothesized that insufficiency of DLL1 causes a human neurodevelopmental disorder. We performed exome sequencing in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. The cohort was identified using known Matchmaker Exchange nodes such as GeneMatcher. This method identified 15 individuals from 12 unrelated families with heterozygous pathogenic DLL1 variants (nonsense, missense, splice site, and one whole gene deletion). The most common features in our cohort were intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, variable brain malformations, muscular hypotonia, and scoliosis. We did not identify an obvious genotype-phenotype correlation. Analysis of one splice site variant showed an in-frame insertion of 12 bp. In conclusion, heterozygous DLL1 pathogenic variants cause a variable neurodevelopmental phenotype and multi-systemic features. The clinical and molecular data support haploinsufficiency as a mechanism for the pathogenesis of this DLL1-related disorder and affirm the importance of DLL1 in human brain development.",case reports; case-report

The variants disrupt highly conserved residues across the protein. Functional experiments, including in silico analysis of the protein structure, in vitro assessment of cell surface expression, and in vitro knockdown, revealed potential mechanisms of pathogenicity of the variants, including loss of protein function and decreased neurite outgrowth. Our data indicate that appropriate expression of NTNG2 plays an important role in neurotypical development.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31513549,Loss-of-function variants in myocardin cause congenital megabladder in humans and mice.,"Myocardin (MYOCD) is the founding member of a class of transcriptional coactivators that bind the serum-response factor to activate gene expression programs critical in smooth muscle (SM) and cardiac muscle development. Insights into the molecular functions of MYOCD have been obtained from cell culture studies, and to date, knowledge about in vivo roles of MYOCD comes exclusively from experimental animals. Here, we defined an often lethal congenital human disease associated with inheritance of pathogenic MYOCD variants. This disease manifested as a massively dilated urinary bladder, or megabladder, with disrupted SM in its wall. We provided evidence that monoallelic loss-of-function variants in MYOCD caused congenital megabladder in males only, whereas biallelic variants were associated with disease in both sexes, with a phenotype additionally involving the cardiovascular system. These results were supported by cosegregation of MYOCD variants with the phenotype in 4 unrelated families by in vitro transactivation studies in which pathogenic variants resulted in abrogated SM gene expression and by the finding of megabladder in 2 distinct mouse models with reduced Myocd activity. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that variants in MYOCD result in human disease, and the collective findings highlight a vital role for MYOCD in mammalian organogenesis.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31422819,Bi-allelic GOT2 Mutations Cause a Treatable Malate-Aspartate Shuttle-Related Encephalopathy.,"Early-infantile encephalopathies with epilepsy are devastating conditions mandating an accurate diagnosis to guide proper management. Whole-exome sequencing was used to investigate the disease etiology in four children from independent families with intellectual disability and epilepsy, revealing bi-allelic GOT2 mutations. In-depth metabolic studies in individual 1 showed low plasma serine, hypercitrullinemia, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia. The epilepsy was serine and pyridoxine responsive. Functional consequences of observed mutations were tested by measuring enzyme activity and by cell and animal models. Zebrafish and mouse models were used to validate brain developmental and functional defects and to test therapeutic strategies. GOT2 encodes the mitochondrial glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase. GOT2 enzyme activity was deficient in fibroblasts with bi-allelic mutations. GOT2, a member of the malate-aspartate shuttle, plays an essential role in the intracellular NAD(H) redox balance. De novo serine biosynthesis was impaired in fibroblasts with GOT2 mutations and GOT2-knockout HEK293 cells. Correcting the highly oxidized cytosolic NAD-redox state by pyruvate supplementation restored serine biosynthesis in GOT2-deficient cells. Knockdown of got2a in zebrafish resulted in a brain developmental defect associated with seizure-like electroencephalography spikes, which could be rescued by supplying pyridoxine in embryo water. Both pyridoxine and serine synergistically rescued embryonic developmental defects in zebrafish got2a morphants. The two treated individuals reacted favorably to their treatment. Our data provide a mechanistic basis for the biochemical abnormalities in GOT2 deficiency that may also hold for other MAS defects.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
30010909,Basonuclin 1 deficiency is a cause of primary ovarian insufficiency.,"Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) leads to infertility and premature menopause in young women. The genetic etiology of this disorder remains unknown in most patients. Using whole exome sequencing of a large Chinese POI pedigree, we identified a heterozygous 5Â bp deletion inducing a frameshift in BNC1, which is predicted to result in a non-sense-mediated decay or a truncated BNC1 protein. Sanger sequencing identified another BNC1 missense mutation in 4 of 82 idiopathic patients with POI, and the mutation was absent in 332 healthy controls. Transfection of recombinant plasmids with the frameshift mutant and separately with the missense mutant in HEK293T cells led to abnormal nuclear localization. Knockdown of BNC1 was found to reduce BMP15 and p-AKT levels and to inhibit meiosis in oocytes. A female mouse model of the human Bnc1 frameshift mutation exhibited infertility, significantly increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone, decreased ovary size and reduced follicle numbers, consistent with POI. We report haploinsufficiency of BNC1 as an etiology of human autosomal dominant POI.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
30478443,Gain-of-function DNMT3A mutations cause microcephalic dwarfism and hypermethylation of Polycomb-regulated regions.,"DNA methylation and Polycomb are key factors in the establishment of vertebrate cellular identity and fate. Here we report de novo missense mutations in DNMT3A, which encodes the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. These mutations cause microcephalic dwarfism, a hypocellular disorder of extreme global growth failure. Substitutions in the PWWP domain abrogate binding to the histone modifications H3K36me2 and H3K36me3, and alter DNA methylation in patient cells. Polycomb-associated DNA methylation valleys, hypomethylated domains encompassing developmental genes, become methylated with concomitant depletion of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 bivalent marks. Such de novo DNA methylation occurs during differentiation of Dnmt3aW326R pluripotent cells in vitro, and is also evident in Dnmt3aW326R/+ dwarf mice. We therefore propose that the interaction of the DNMT3A PWWP domain with H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 normally limits DNA methylation of Polycomb-marked regions. Our findings implicate the interplay between DNA methylation and Polycomb at key developmental regulators as a determinant of organism size in mammals.",research-article; journal article

Methods:Diagnostic trio whole exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, use of GeneMatcher, targeted gene panel sequencing, and MiSeq sequencing techniques were used to identify and confirm variants. RT-qPCR was used to measure the normal expression pattern of PHF21A in multiple human tissues including 13 different brain tissues. Protein-DNA modeling was performed to substantiate the pathogenicity of the missense mutation. Results:We have identified seven heterozygous coding mutations, among which six are de novo (not maternal in one). Mutations include four frameshifts, one nonsense mutation in two patients, and one heterozygous missense mutation in the AT Hook domain, predicted to be deleterious and likely to cause loss of PHF21A function. We also found a new C-terminal domain composed of an intrinsically disordered region. This domain is truncated in six patients and thus likely to play an important role in the function of PHF21A, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the likely underlying mechanism in the phenotype of seven patients. Our results extend the phenotypic spectrum of PHF21A mutations by adding autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, hypotonia, and neurobehavioral problems. Furthermore, PHF21A is highly expressed in the human fetal brain, which is consistent with the neurodevelopmental phenotype. Conclusion:Deleterious nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations disrupting the AT Hook domain and/or an intrinsically disordered region in PHF21A were found to be associated with autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, hypotonia, neurobehavioral problems, tapering fingers, clinodactyly, and syndactyly, in addition to intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies. This suggests that PHF21A is involved in autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, and its haploinsufficiency causes a diverse neurological phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
31570889,Postzygotic inactivating mutations of RHOA cause a mosaic neuroectodermal syndrome.,"Hypopigmentation along Blaschko's lines is a hallmark of a poorly defined group of mosaic syndromes whose genetic causes are unknown. Here we show that postzygotic inactivating mutations of RHOA cause a neuroectodermal syndrome combining linear hypopigmentation, alopecia, apparently asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy, and facial, ocular, dental and acral anomalies. Our findings pave the way toward elucidating the etiology of pigmentary mosaicism and highlight the role of RHOA in human development and disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31630789,RPL13 Variants Cause Spondyloepimetaphyseal Dysplasia with Severe Short Stature.,"Variants in genes encoding ribosomal proteins have thus far been associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia, a rare inherited bone marrow failure, and isolated congenital asplenia. Here, we report one de novo missense variant and three de novo splice variants in RPL13, which encodes ribosomal protein RPL13 (also called eL13), in four unrelated individuals with a rare bone dysplasia causing severe short stature. The three splice variants (c.477+1G>T, c.477+1G>A, and c.477+2 T>C) result in partial intron retention, which leads to an 18-amino acid insertion. In contrast to observations from Diamond-Blackfan anemia, we detected no evidence of significant pre-rRNA processing disturbance in cells derived from two affected individuals. Consistently, we showed that the insertion-containing protein is stably expressed and incorporated into 60S subunits similar to the wild-type protein. Erythroid proliferation in culture and ribosome profile on sucrose gradient are modified, suggesting a change in translation dynamics. We also provide evidence that RPL13 is present at high levels in chondrocytes and osteoblasts in mouse growth plates. Taken together, we show that the identified RPL13 variants cause a human ribosomopathy defined by a rare skeletal dysplasia, and we highlight the role of this ribosomal protein in bone development.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31152168,De novo loss-of-function KCNMA1 variants are associated with a new multiple malformation syndrome and a broad spectrum of developmental and neurological phenotypes.,"KCNMA1 encodes the large-conductance Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ (BK) potassium channel α-subunit, and pathogenic gain-of-function variants in this gene have been associated with a dominant form of generalized epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia. Here, we genetically and functionally characterize eight novel loss-of-function (LoF) variants of KCNMA1. Genome or exome sequencing and the participation in the international Matchmaker Exchange effort allowed for the identification of novel KCNMA1 variants. Patch clamping was used to assess functionality of mutant BK channels. The KCNMA1 variants p.(Ser351Tyr), p.(Gly356Arg), p.(Gly375Arg), p.(Asn449fs) and p.(Ile663Val) abolished the BK current, whereas p.(Cys413Tyr) and p.(Pro805Leu) reduced the BK current amplitude and shifted the activation curves toward positive potentials. The p.(Asp984Asn) variant reduced the current amplitude without affecting kinetics. A phenotypic analysis of the patients carrying the recurrent p.(Gly375Arg) de novo missense LoF variant revealed a novel syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with severe developmental delay, visceral and cardiac malformations, connective tissue presentations with arterial involvement, bone dysplasia and characteristic dysmorphic features. Patients with other LoF variants presented with neurological and developmental symptoms including developmental delay, intellectual disability, ataxia, axial hypotonia, cerebral atrophy and speech delay/apraxia/dysarthria. Therefore, LoF KCNMA1 variants are associated with a new syndrome characterized by a broad spectrum of neurological phenotypes and developmental disorders. LoF variants of KCNMA1 cause a new syndrome distinctly different from gain-of-function variants in the same gene.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31586943,"Recurrent homozygous damaging mutation in TMX2, encoding a protein disulfide isomerase, in four families with microlissencephaly.","BACKGROUND:Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) proteins are part of the thioredoxin protein superfamily. PDIs are involved in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues during protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and are implicated in stress response pathways. METHODS:Eight children from four consanguineous families residing in distinct geographies within the Middle East and Central Asia were recruited for study. All probands showed structurally similar microcephaly with lissencephaly (microlissencephaly) brain malformations. DNA samples from each family underwent whole exome sequencing, assessment for repeat expansions and confirmatory segregation analysis. RESULTS:An identical homozygous variant in TMX2 (c.500G>A), encoding thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 2, segregated with disease in all four families. This variant changed the last coding base of exon 6, and impacted mRNA stability. All patients presented with microlissencephaly, global developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. While TMX2 is an activator of cellular C9ORF72 repeat expansion toxicity, patients showed no evidence of C9ORF72 repeat expansions. CONCLUSION:The TMX2 c.500G>A allele associates with recessive microlissencephaly, and patients show no evidence of C9ORF72 expansions. TMX2 is the first PDI implicated in a recessive disease, suggesting a protein isomerisation defect in microlissencephaly.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31735293,"TMX2 Is a Crucial Regulator of Cellular Redox State, and Its Dysfunction Causes Severe Brain Developmental Abnormalities.","The redox state of the neural progenitors regulates physiological processes such as neuronal differentiation and dendritic and axonal growth. The relevance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated oxidoreductases in these processes is largely unexplored. We describe a severe neurological disorder caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in thioredoxin (TRX)-related transmembrane-2 (TMX2); these variants were detected by exome sequencing in 14 affected individuals from ten unrelated families presenting with congenital microcephaly, cortical polymicrogyria, and other migration disorders. TMX2 encodes one of the five TMX proteins of the protein disulfide isomerase family, hitherto not linked to human developmental brain disease. Our mechanistic studies on protein function show that TMX2 localizes to the ER mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), is involved in posttranslational modification and protein folding, and undergoes physical interaction with the MAM-associated and ER folding chaperone calnexin and ER calcium pump SERCA2. These interactions are functionally relevant because TMX2-deficient fibroblasts show decreased mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity and compensatory increased glycolytic activity. Intriguingly, under basal conditions TMX2 occurs in both reduced and oxidized monomeric form, while it forms a stable dimer under treatment with hydrogen peroxide, recently recognized as a signaling molecule in neural morphogenesis and axonal pathfinding. Exogenous expression of the pathogenic TMX2 variants or of variants with an in vitro mutagenized TRX domain induces a constitutive TMX2 polymerization, mimicking an increased oxidative state. Altogether these data uncover TMX2 as a sensor in the MAM-regulated redox signaling pathway and identify it as a key adaptive regulator of neuronal proliferation, migration, and organization in the developing brain.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31256877,Paralog Studies Augment Gene Discovery: DDX and DHX Genes.,"Members of a paralogous gene family in which variation in one gene is known to cause disease are eight times more likely to also be associated with human disease. Recent studies have elucidated DHX30 and DDX3X as genes for which pathogenic variant alleles are involved in neurodevelopmental disorders. We hypothesized that variants in paralogous genes encoding members of the DExD/H-box RNA helicase superfamily might also underlie developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (DD and/or ID) disease phenotypes. Here we describe 15 unrelated individuals who have DD and/or ID, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, vertebral anomalies, and dysmorphic features and were found to have probably damaging variants in DExD/H-box RNA helicase genes. In addition, these individuals exhibit a variety of other tissue and organ system involvement including ocular, outer ear, hearing, cardiac, and kidney tissues. Five individuals with homozygous (one), compound-heterozygous (two), or de novo (two) missense variants in DHX37 were identified by exome sequencing. We identified ten total individuals with missense variants in three other DDX/DHX paralogs: DHX16 (four individuals), DDX54 (three individuals), and DHX34 (three individuals). Most identified variants are rare, predicted to be damaging, and occur at conserved amino acid residues. Taken together, these 15 individuals implicate the DExD/H-box helicases in both dominantly and recessively inherited neurodevelopmental phenotypes and highlight the potential for more than one disease mechanism underlying these disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
28585349,CSNK2B splice site mutations in patients cause intellectual disability with or without myoclonic epilepsy.,"De novo mutations are a frequent cause of disorders related to brain development. We report the results from the screening of two patients diagnosed with intellectual disability (ID) using exome sequencing to identify new causative de novo mutations. Exome sequencing was conducted in two patient-parent trios to identify de novo variants. In silico and expression studies were also performed to evaluate the functional consequences of these variants. The two patients presented developmental delay with minor facial dysmorphy. One of them presented pharmacoresistant myoclonic epilepsy. We identified two de novo splice variants (c.175+2T>G; c.367+2T>C) in the CSNK2B gene encoding the β subunit of the Caseine kinase 2 (CK2). CK2 is a ubiquitously expressed kinase that is present in high levels in brain and it appears to be constitutively active. The mRNA transcripts were abnormal and significantly reduced in affected fibroblasts and most likely produced truncated proteins. Taking into account that mutations in CSNK2A1, encoding the α subunit of CK2, were previously identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and dysmorphic features, our study confirmed that the protein kinase CK2 plays a major role in brain, and showed that CSNK2, encoding the β subunit, is a novel ID gene. This study adds knowledge to the increasingly growing list of causative and candidate genes in ID and epilepsy, and highlights CSNK2B as a new gene for neurodevelopmental disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
26340333,Gain-of-Function Mutations in ZIC1 Are Associated with Coronal Craniosynostosis and Learning Disability.,"Human ZIC1 (zinc finger protein of cerebellum 1), one of five homologs of the Drosophila pair-rule gene odd-paired, encodes a transcription factor previously implicated in vertebrate brain development. Heterozygous deletions of ZIC1 and its nearby paralog ZIC4 on chromosome 3q25.1 are associated with Dandy-Walker malformation of the cerebellum, and loss of the orthologous Zic1 gene in the mouse causes cerebellar hypoplasia and vertebral defects. We describe individuals from five families with heterozygous mutations located in the final (third) exon of ZIC1 (encoding four nonsense and one missense change) who have a distinct phenotype in which severe craniosynostosis, specifically involving the coronal sutures, and variable learning disability are the most characteristic features. The location of the nonsense mutations predicts escape of mutant ZIC1 transcripts from nonsense-mediated decay, which was confirmed in a cell line from an affected individual. Both nonsense and missense mutations are associated with altered and/or enhanced expression of a target gene, engrailed-2, in a Xenopus embryo assay. Analysis of mouse embryos revealed a localized domain of Zic1 expression at embryonic days 11.5-12.5 in a region overlapping the supraorbital regulatory center, which patterns the coronal suture. We conclude that the human mutations uncover a previously unsuspected role for Zic1 in early cranial suture development, potentially by regulating engrailed 1, which was previously shown to be critical for positioning of the murine coronal suture. The diagnosis of a ZIC1 mutation has significant implications for prognosis and we recommend genetic testing when common causes of coronal synostosis have been excluded.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; journal article; case reports"
31630790,Bi-allelic Pathogenic Variants in TUBGCP2 Cause Microcephaly and Lissencephaly Spectrum Disorders.,"Lissencephaly comprises a spectrum of malformations of cortical development. This spectrum includes agyria, pachygyria, and subcortical band heterotopia; each represents anatomical malformations of brain cortical development caused by neuronal migration defects. The molecular etiologies of neuronal migration anomalies are highly enriched for genes encoding microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins, and this enrichment highlights the critical role for these genes in cortical growth and gyrification. Using exome sequencing and family based rare variant analyses, we identified a homozygous variant (c.997C>T [p.Arg333Cys]) in TUBGCP2, encoding gamma-tubulin complex protein 2 (GCP2), in two individuals from a consanguineous family; both individuals presented with microcephaly and developmental delay. GCP2 forms the multiprotein γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) together with γ-tubulin and other GCPs to regulate the assembly of microtubules. By querying clinical exome sequencing cases and through GeneMatcher-facilitated collaborations, we found three additional families with bi-allelic variation and similarly affected phenotypes including a homozygous variant (c.1843G>C [p.Ala615Pro]) in two families and compound heterozygous variants consisting of one missense variant (c.889C>T [p.Arg297Cys]) and one splice variant (c.2025-2A>G) in another family. Brain imaging from all five affected individuals revealed varying degrees of cortical malformations including pachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia, presumably caused by disruption of neuronal migration. Our data demonstrate that pathogenic variants in TUBGCP2 cause an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental trait consisting of a neuronal migration disorder, and our data implicate GCP2 as a core component of γ-TuRC in neuronal migrating cells.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31794024,Deficiencies in vesicular transport mediated by TRAPPC4 are associated with severe syndromic intellectual disability.,"The conserved transport protein particle (TRAPP) complexes regulate key trafficking events and are required for autophagy. TRAPPC4, like its yeast Trs23 orthologue, is a core component of the TRAPP complexes and one of the essential subunits for guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for Rab1 GTPase. Pathogenic variants in specific TRAPP subunits are associated with neurological disorders. We undertook exome sequencing in three unrelated families of Caucasian, Turkish and French-Canadian ethnicities with seven affected children that showed features of early-onset seizures, developmental delay, microcephaly, sensorineural deafness, spastic quadriparesis and progressive cortical and cerebellar atrophy in an effort to determine the genetic aetiology underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. All seven affected subjects shared the same identical rare, homozygous, potentially pathogenic variant in a non-canonical, well-conserved splice site within TRAPPC4 (hg19:chr11:g.118890966A>G; TRAPPC4: NM_016146.5; c.454+3A>G). Single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis revealed there was no haplotype shared between the tested Turkish and Caucasian families suggestive of a variant hotspot region rather than a founder effect. In silico analysis predicted the variant to cause aberrant splicing. Consistent with this, experimental evidence showed both a reduction in full-length transcript levels and an increase in levels of a shorter transcript missing exon 3, suggestive of an incompletely penetrant splice defect. TRAPPC4 protein levels were significantly reduced whilst levels of other TRAPP complex subunits remained unaffected. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography demonstrated a defect in TRAPP complex assembly and/or stability. Intracellular trafficking through the Golgi using the marker protein VSVG-GFP-ts045 demonstrated significantly delayed entry into and exit from the Golgi in fibroblasts derived from one of the affected subjects. Lentiviral expression of wild-type TRAPPC4 in these fibroblasts restored trafficking, suggesting that the trafficking defect was due to reduced TRAPPC4 levels. Consistent with the recent association of the TRAPP complex with autophagy, we found that the fibroblasts had a basal autophagy defect and a delay in autophagic flux, possibly due to unsealed autophagosomes. These results were validated using a yeast trs23 temperature sensitive variant that exhibits constitutive and stress-induced autophagic defects at permissive temperature and a secretory defect at restrictive temperature. In summary we provide strong evidence for pathogenicity of this variant in a member of the core TRAPP subunit, TRAPPC4 that associates with vesicular trafficking and autophagy defects. This is the first report of a TRAPPC4 variant, and our findings add to the growing number of TRAPP-associated neurological disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31820119,"Loss of UGP2 in brain leads to a severe epileptic encephalopathy, emphasizing that bi-allelic isoform-specific start-loss mutations of essential genes can cause genetic diseases.","Developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of devastating genetic disorders, resulting in early-onset, therapy-resistant seizures and developmental delay. Here we report on 22 individuals from 15 families presenting with a severe form of intractable epilepsy, severe developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, visual disturbance and similar minor dysmorphisms. Whole exome sequencing identified a recurrent, homozygous variant (chr2:64083454A > G) in the essential UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP2) gene in all probands. This rare variant results in a tolerable Met12Val missense change of the longer UGP2 protein isoform but causes a disruption of the start codon of the shorter isoform, which is predominant in brain. We show that the absence of the shorter isoform leads to a reduction of functional UGP2 enzyme in neural stem cells, leading to altered glycogen metabolism, upregulated unfolded protein response and premature neuronal differentiation, as modeled during pluripotent stem cell differentiation in vitro. In contrast, the complete lack of all UGP2 isoforms leads to differentiation defects in multiple lineages in human cells. Reduced expression of Ugp2a/Ugp2b in vivo in zebrafish mimics visual disturbance and mutant animals show a behavioral phenotype. Our study identifies a recurrent start codon mutation in UGP2 as a cause of a novel autosomal recessive DEE syndrome. Importantly, it also shows that isoform-specific start-loss mutations causing expression loss of a tissue-relevant isoform of an essential protein can cause a genetic disease, even when an organism-wide protein absence is incompatible with life. We provide additional examples where a similar disease mechanism applies.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31735292,"Mutations in TTC29, Encoding an Evolutionarily Conserved Axonemal Protein, Result in Asthenozoospermia and Male Infertility.","In humans, structural or functional defects of the sperm flagellum induce asthenozoospermia, which accounts for the main sperm defect encountered in infertile men. Herein we focused on morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagellum (MMAF), a phenotype also termed ""short tails,"" which constitutes one of the most severe sperm morphological defects resulting in asthenozoospermia. In previous work based on whole-exome sequencing of a cohort of 167 MMAF-affected individuals, we identified bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in more than 30% of the tested subjects. In this study, we further analyzed this cohort and identified five individuals with homozygous truncating variants in TTC29, a gene preferentially and highly expressed in the testis, and encoding a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein related to the intraflagellar transport (IFT). One individual carried a frameshift variant, another one carried a homozygous stop-gain variant, and three carried the same splicing variant affecting a consensus donor site. The deleterious effect of this last variant was confirmed on the corresponding transcript and protein product. In addition, we produced and analyzed TTC29 loss-of-function models in the flagellated protist T. brucei and in M. musculus. Both models confirmed the importance of TTC29 for flagellar beating. We showed that in T. brucei the TPR structural motifs, highly conserved between the studied orthologs, are critical for TTC29 axonemal localization and flagellar beating. Overall our work demonstrates that TTC29 is a conserved axonemal protein required for flagellar structure and beating and that TTC29 mutations are a cause of male sterility due to MMAF.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30905399,"De Novo Missense Substitutions in the Gene Encoding CDK8, a Regulator of the Mediator Complex, Cause a Syndromic Developmental Disorder.","The Mediator is an evolutionarily conserved, multi-subunit complex that regulates multiple steps of transcription. Mediator activity is regulated by the reversible association of a four-subunit module comprising CDK8 or CDK19 kinases, together with cyclin C, MED12 or MED12L, and MED13 or MED13L. Mutations in MED12, MED13, and MED13L were previously identified in syndromic developmental disorders with overlapping phenotypes. Here, we report CDK8 mutations (located at 13q12.13) that cause a phenotypically related disorder. Using whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing, and by international collaboration, we identified eight different heterozygous missense CDK8 substitutions, including 10 shown to have arisen de novo, in 12 unrelated subjects; a recurrent mutation, c.185C>T (p.Ser62Leu), was present in five individuals. All predicted substitutions localize to the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain. Affected individuals have overlapping phenotypes characterized by hypotonia, mild to moderate intellectual disability, behavioral disorders, and variable facial dysmorphism. Congenital heart disease occurred in six subjects; additional features present in multiple individuals included agenesis of the corpus callosum, ano-rectal malformations, seizures, and hearing or visual impairments. To evaluate the functional impact of the mutations, we measured phosphorylation at STAT1-Ser727, a known CDK8 substrate, in a CDK8 and CDK19 CRISPR double-knockout cell line transfected with wild-type (WT) or mutant CDK8 constructs. These experiments demonstrated a reduction in STAT1 phosphorylation by all mutants, in most cases to a similar extent as in a kinase-dead control. We conclude that missense mutations in CDK8 cause a developmental disorder that has phenotypic similarity to syndromes associated with mutations in other subunits of the Mediator kinase module, indicating probable overlap in pathogenic mechanisms.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31151990,Loss-of-function mutations in SPEF2 cause multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF).,"BACKGROUND:Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) is a kind of severe teratozoospermia. Patients with the MMAF phenotype are infertile and present aberrant spermatozoa with absent, short, coiled, bent and/or irregular flagella. Mutations in several genes can explain approximately 30%-50% of MMAF cases and more genetic pathogenies need to be explored. SPEF2 was previously demonstrated to play an essential role in sperm tail development in mice and pig. Dysfunctional mutations in SPEF2 impair sperm motility and cause a short-tail phenotype in both animal models. OBJECTIVE:Based on 42 patients with severe infertility and MMAF phenotype, we explored the new genetic cause of human MMAF phenotype. METHODS AND RESULTS:By screening gene variants in 42 patients with MMAF using whole exome sequencing, we identified the c. 12delC, c. 1745-2A > G, c. 4102 G > T and c. 4323dupA mutations in the SPEF2 gene from two patients. Both of these mutations are rare and potentially deleterious. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis showed a disrupted axonemal structure with mitochondrial sheath defects in the patients' spermatozoa. The SPEF2 protein level was significantly decreased in the spermatozoa of the patients revealed by Western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses.

Mutations in the SPEF2 gene reduce sperm motility and cause sperm tail defects in animal models and humans. In the present study, we performed a genetic analysis on an MMAF patient and identified novel biallelic mutations in the SPEF2 gene. The biallelic mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and in silico analysis revealed that, these variations were deleterious. The expression of truncated SPEF2 protein was reduced significantly in the patient's spermatozoa. The spermatozoa harbored biallelic mutations and showed severe ultrastructural defects in the axoneme and mitochondrial sheath. Our data suggest that biallelic mutations in SPEF2 can cause severe sperm flagellum defects, thus providing a novel candidate genetic pathogen for the human MMAF phenotype.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
28972538,Mutations in signal recognition particle SRP54 cause syndromic neutropenia with Shwachman-Diamond-like features.,"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) (OMIM #260400) is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS) that is primarily characterized by neutropenia and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Seventy-five to ninety percent of patients have compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (sbds) gene. Using trio whole-exome sequencing (WES) in an sbds-negative SDS family and candidate gene sequencing in additional SBDS-negative SDS cases or molecularly undiagnosed IBMFS cases, we identified 3 independent patients, each of whom carried a de novo missense variant in srp54 (encoding signal recognition particle 54 kDa). These 3 patients shared congenital neutropenia linked with various other SDS phenotypes. 3D protein modeling revealed that the 3 variants affect highly conserved amino acids within the GTPase domain of the protein that are critical for GTP and receptor binding. Indeed, we observed that the GTPase activity of the mutated proteins was impaired. The level of SRP54 mRNA in the bone marrow was 3.6-fold lower in patients with SRP54-mutations than in healthy controls. Profound reductions in neutrophil counts and chemotaxis as well as a diminished exocrine pancreas size in a SRP54-knockdown zebrafish model faithfully recapitulated the human phenotype. In conclusion, autosomal dominant mutations in SRP54, a key member of the cotranslation protein-targeting pathway, lead to syndromic neutropenia with a Shwachman-Diamond-like phenotype.",research-article; journal article
30929742,Mutations in the Neuronal Vesicular SNARE VAMP2 Affect Synaptic Membrane Fusion and Impair Human Neurodevelopment.,"VAMP2 encodes the vesicular SNARE protein VAMP2 (also called synaptobrevin-2). Together with its partners syntaxin-1A and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), VAMP2 mediates fusion of synaptic vesicles to release neurotransmitters. VAMP2 is essential for vesicular exocytosis and activity-dependent neurotransmitter release. Here, we report five heterozygous de novo mutations in VAMP2 in unrelated individuals presenting with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by axial hypotonia (which had been present since birth), intellectual disability, and autistic features. In total, we identified two single-amino-acid deletions and three non-synonymous variants affecting conserved residues within the C terminus of the VAMP2 SNARE motif. Affected individuals carrying de novo non-synonymous variants involving the C-terminal region presented a more severe phenotype with additional neurological features, including central visual impairment, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and epilepsy or electroencephalography abnormalities. Reconstituted fusion involving a lipid-mixing assay indicated impairment in vesicle fusion as one of the possible associated disease mechanisms.

27878435,Novel phenotypes and loci identified through clinical genomics approaches to pediatric cataract.,"Pediatric cataract is highly heterogeneous clinically and etiologically. While mostly isolated, cataract can be part of many multisystem disorders, further complicating the diagnostic process. In this study, we applied genomic tools in the form of a multi-gene panel as well as whole-exome sequencing on unselected cohort of pediatric cataract (166 patients from 74 families). Mutations in previously reported cataract genes were identified in 58% for a total of 43 mutations, including 15 that are novel. GEMIN4 was independently mutated in families with a syndrome of cataract, global developmental delay with or without renal involvement. We also highlight a recognizable syndrome that resembles galactosemia (a fulminant infantile liver disease with cataract) caused by biallelic mutations in CYP51A1. A founder mutation in RIC1 (KIAA1432) was identified in patients with cataract, brain atrophy, microcephaly with or without cleft lip and palate. For non-syndromic pediatric cataract, we map a novel locus in a multiplex consanguineous family on 4p15.32 where exome sequencing revealed a homozygous truncating mutation in TAPT1. We report two further candidates that are biallelically inactivated each in a single cataract family: TAF1A (cataract with global developmental delay) and WDR87 (non-syndromic cataract). In addition to positional mapping data, we use iSyTE developmental lens expression and gene-network analysis to corroborate the proposed link between the novel candidate genes and cataract. Our study expands the phenotypic, allelic and locus heterogeneity of pediatric cataract. The high diagnostic yield of clinical genomics supports the adoption of this approach in this patient group.",research-article; journal article

Using a gene-based phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in the EHR-linked BioVU biobank, we show that reduced genetically determined expression of RIC1 is associated with musculoskeletal and dental conditions. Whole-exome sequencing identified individuals homozygous-by-descent for a rare variant in RIC1 and, through a guided clinical re-evaluation, it was discovered that they share signs with the BioVU-associated phenome. We named this new Mendelian syndrome CATIFA (cleft lip, cataract, tooth abnormality, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) and revealed further disease mechanisms.

In two Arab consanguineous families, we mapped a ciliopathy phenotype that most closely matches Joubert syndrome (hypotonia, developmental delay, typical facies, oculomotor apraxia, polydactyly, and subtle posterior fossa abnormalities) to a single locus in which a founder homozygous truncating variant in FAM149B1 was identified by exome sequencing. We subsequently identified a third Arab consanguineous multiplex family in which the phenotype of Joubert syndrome/oral-facial-digital syndrome (OFD VI) was found to co-segregate with the same founder variant in FAM149B1. Independently, autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in a consanguineous Turkish family with Joubert syndrome highlighted a different homozygous truncating variant in the same gene. FAM149B1 encodes a protein of unknown function. Mutant fibroblasts were found to have normal ciliogenesis potential. However, distinct cilia-related abnormalities were observed in these cells: abnormal accumulation IFT complex at the distal tips of the cilia, which assumed bulbous appearance, increased length of the primary cilium, and dysregulated SHH signaling. We conclude that FAM149B1 is required for normal ciliary biology and that its deficiency results in a range of ciliopathy phenotypes in humans along the spectrum of Joubert syndrome.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31960134,Recessive mutations in SCYL2 cause a novel syndromic form of arthrogryposis in humans.,"Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is an important birth defect with a significant genetic contribution. Many syndromic forms of AMC have been described, but remain unsolved at the molecular level. In this report, we describe a novel syndromic form of AMC in two multiplex consanguineous families from Saudi Arabia and Oman. The phenotype is highly consistent, and comprises neurogenic arthrogryposis, microcephaly, brain malformation (absent corpus callosum), optic atrophy, limb fractures, profound global developmental delay, and early lethality. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a different homozygous truncating variant in SCYL2 in each of the two families. SCYL2 is a component of clathrin-coated vesicles, and deficiency of its mouse ortholog results in a severe neurological phenotype that largely recapitulates the phenotype observed in our patients. Our results suggest that severe neurogenic arthrogryposis with brain malformation is the human phenotypic consequence of SCYL2Â loss of function mutations.",clinical trial; multicenter study; journal article; case reports
26788030,Identification of presumed pathogenic KRT3 and KRT12 gene mutations associated with Meesmann corneal dystrophy.,"To report potentially pathogenic mutations in the keratin 3 (KRT3) and keratin 12 (KRT12) genes in two individuals with clinically diagnosed Meesmann corneal dystrophy (MECD).Slit-lamp examination was performed on the probands and available family members to identify characteristic features of MECD. After informed consent was obtained, saliva samples were obtained as a source of genomic DNA, and screening of KRT3 and KRT12 was performed. Potentially pathogenic variants were screened for in 200 control chromosomes. PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and PANTHER were used to predict the functional impact of identified variants. Short tandem repeat genotyping was performed to confirm paternity.Slit-lamp examination of the first proband demonstrated bilateral, diffusely distributed, clear epithelial microcysts, consistent with MECD. Screening of KRT3 revealed a heterozygous missense variant in exon 1, c.250C>T (p.(Arg84Trp)), which has a minor allele frequency of 0.0076 and was not identified in 200 control chromosomes. In silico analysis with PolyPhen-2 and PANTHER predicted the variant to be damaging to protein function; however, SIFT analysis predicted tolerance of the variant. The second proband demonstrated bilateral, diffusely distributed epithelial opacities that appeared gray-white on direct illumination and translucent on retroillumination. Neither parent demonstrated corneal opacities. Screening of KRT12 revealed a novel heterozygous insertion/deletion variant in exon 6, c.1288_1293delinsAGCCCT (p.(Arg430_Arg431delinsSerPro)). This variant was not present in either of the proband's parents or in 200 control chromosomes and was predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2, PANTHER, and SIFT. Haplotype analysis confirmed paternity of the second proband, indicating that the variant arose de novo.We present a novel KRT12 mutation, representing the first de novo mutation and the first indel in KRT12 associated with MECD. In addition, we report a variant of uncertain significance in KRT3 in an individual with MECD. Although the potential pathogenicity of this variant is unknown, it is the first variant affecting the head domain of K3 to be reported in an individual with MECD and suggests that disease-causing variants associated with MECD may not be restricted to primary sequence alterations of either the helix-initiation or helix-termination motifs of K3 and K12.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
28052917,A mutation of EPT1 (SELENOI) underlies a new disorder of Kennedy pathway phospholipid biosynthesis.,"Mutations in genes involved in lipid metabolism have increasingly been associated with various subtypes of hereditary spastic paraplegia, a highly heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative motor neuron disorders characterized by spastic paraparesis. Here, we report an unusual autosomal recessive neurodegenerative condition, best classified as a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia, associated with mutation in the ethanolaminephosphotransferase 1 (EPT1) gene (now known as SELENOI), responsible for the final step in Kennedy pathway forming phosphatidylethanolamine from CDP-ethanolamine. Phosphatidylethanolamine is a glycerophospholipid that, together with phosphatidylcholine, constitutes more than half of the total phospholipids in eukaryotic cell membranes. We determined that the mutation defined dramatically reduces the enzymatic activity of EPT1, thereby hindering the final step in phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis. Additionally, due to central nervous system inaccessibility we undertook quantification of phosphatidylethanolamine levels and species in patient and control blood samples as an indication of liver phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis. Although this revealed alteration to levels of specific phosphatidylethanolamine fatty acyl species in patients, overall phosphatidylethanolamine levels were broadly unaffected indicating that in blood EPT1 inactivity may be compensated for, in part, via alternate biochemical pathways. These studies define the first human disorder arising due to defective CDP-ethanolamine biosynthesis and provide new insight into the role of Kennedy pathway components in human neurological function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31637422,Mutations in PCYT2 disrupt etherlipid biosynthesis and cause a complex hereditary spastic paraplegia.,"CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (ET), encoded by PCYT2, is the rate-limiting enzyme for phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. Phosphatidylethanolamine is one of the most abundant membrane lipids and is particularly enriched in the brain. We identified five individuals with biallelic PCYT2 variants clinically characterized by global developmental delay with regression, spastic para- or tetraparesis, epilepsy and progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Using patient fibroblasts we demonstrated that these variants are hypomorphic, result in altered but residual ET protein levels and concomitant reduced enzyme activity without affecting mRNA levels. The significantly better survival of hypomorphic CRISPR-Cas9 generated pcyt2 zebrafish knockout compared to a complete knockout, in conjunction with previously described data on the Pcyt2 mouse model, indicates that complete loss of ET function may be incompatible with life in vertebrates. Lipidomic analysis revealed profound lipid abnormalities in patient fibroblasts impacting both neutral etherlipid and etherphospholipid metabolism. Plasma lipidomics studies also identified changes in etherlipids that have the potential to be used as biomarkers for ET deficiency. In conclusion, our data establish PCYT2 as a disease gene for a new complex hereditary spastic paraplegia and confirm that etherlipid homeostasis is important for the development and function of the brain.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30115739,hCALCRL mutation causes autosomal recessive nonimmune hydrops fetalis with lymphatic dysplasia.,"We report the first case of nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) associated with a recessive, in-frame deletion of V205 in the G protein-coupled receptor, Calcitonin Receptor-Like Receptor (hCALCRL). Homozygosity results in fetal demise from hydrops fetalis, while heterozygosity in females is associated with spontaneous miscarriage and subfertility. Using molecular dynamic modeling and in vitro biochemical assays, we show that the hCLR(V205del) mutant results in misfolding of the first extracellular loop, reducing association with its requisite receptor chaperone, receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP), translocation to the plasma membrane and signaling. Using three independent genetic mouse models we establish that the adrenomedullin-CLR-RAMP2 axis is both necessary and sufficient for driving lymphatic vascular proliferation. Genetic ablation of either lymphatic endothelial Calcrl or nonendothelial Ramp2 leads to severe NIHF with embryonic demise and placental pathologies, similar to that observed in humans. Our results highlight a novel candidate gene for human congenital NIHF and provide structure-function insights of this signaling axis for human physiology.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31834374,MN1 C-terminal truncation syndrome is a novel neurodevelopmental and craniofacial disorder with partial rhombencephalosynapsis.,"MN1 encodes a transcriptional co-regulator without homology to other proteins, previously implicated in acute myeloid leukaemia and development of the palate. Large deletions encompassing MN1 have been reported in individuals with variable neurodevelopmental anomalies and non-specific facial features. We identified a cluster of de novo truncating mutations in MN1 in a cohort of 23 individuals with strikingly similar dysmorphic facial features, especially midface hypoplasia, and intellectual disability with severe expressive language delay. Imaging revealed an atypical form of rhombencephalosynapsis, a distinctive brain malformation characterized by partial or complete loss of the cerebellar vermis with fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres, in 8/10 individuals. Rhombencephalosynapsis has no previously known definitive genetic or environmental causes. Other frequent features included perisylvian polymicrogyria, abnormal posterior clinoid processes and persistent trigeminal artery. MN1 is encoded by only two exons. All mutations, including the recurrent variant p.Arg1295* observed in 8/21 probands, fall in the terminal exon or the extreme 3' region of exon 1, and are therefore predicted to result in escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This was confirmed in fibroblasts from three individuals. We propose that the condition described here, MN1 C-terminal truncation (MCTT) syndrome, is not due to MN1 haploinsufficiency but rather is the result of dominantly acting C-terminally truncated MN1 protein. Our data show that MN1 plays a critical role in human craniofacial and brain development, and opens the door to understanding the biological mechanisms underlying rhombencephalosynapsis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31839203,Gain-of-Function MN1 Truncation Variants Cause a Recognizable Syndrome with Craniofacial and Brain Abnormalities.,"MN1 was originally identified as a tumor-suppressor gene. Knockout mouse studies have suggested that Mn1 is associated with craniofacial development. However, no MN1-related phenotypes have been established in humans. Here, we report on three individuals who have de novo MN1 variants that lead to a protein lacking the carboxyl (C) terminus and who presented with severe developmental delay, craniofacial abnormalities with specific facial features, and structural abnormalities in the brain. An in vitro study revealed that the deletion of the C-terminal region led to increased protein stability, an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, and enhanced MN1 aggregation in nuclei compared to what occurred in the wild type, suggesting that a gain-of-function mechanism is involved in this disease. Considering that C-terminal deletion increases the fraction of intrinsically disordered regions of MN1, it is possible that altered phase separation could be involved in the mechanism underlying the disease. Our data indicate that MN1 participates in transcriptional regulation of target genes through interaction with the transcription factors PBX1, PKNOX1, and ZBTB24 and that mutant MN1 impairs the binding with ZBTB24 and RING1, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. On the basis of our findings, we propose the model that C-terminal deletion interferes with MN1's interaction molecules related to the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway, including RING1, and increases the amount of the mutant protein; this increase leads to the dysregulation of MN1 target genes by inhibiting rapid MN1 protein turnover.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
31883641,"Bi-Allelic UQCRFS1 Variants Are Associated with Mitochondrial Complex III Deficiency, Cardiomyopathy, and Alopecia Totalis.","Isolated complex III (CIII) deficiencies are among the least frequently diagnosed mitochondrial disorders. Clinical symptoms range from isolated myopathy to severe multi-systemic disorders with early death and disability. To date, we know of pathogenic variants in genes encoding five out of 10 subunits and five out of 13 assembly factors of CIII. Here we describe rare bi-allelic variants in the gene of a catalytic subunit of CIII, UQCRFS1, which encodes the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, in two unrelated individuals. Affected children presented with low CIII activity in fibroblasts, lactic acidosis, fetal bradycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and alopecia totalis. Studies in proband-derived fibroblasts showed a deleterious effect of the variants on UQCRFS1 protein abundance, mitochondrial import, CIII assembly, and cellular respiration. Complementation studies via lentiviral transduction and overexpression of wild-type UQCRFS1 restored mitochondrial function and rescued the cellular phenotype, confirming UQCRFS1 variants as causative for CIII deficiency. We demonstrate that mutations in UQCRFS1 can cause mitochondrial disease, and our results thereby expand the clinical and mutational spectrum of CIII deficiencies.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
31866046,Pathogenic Bi-allelic Mutations in NDUFAF8 Cause Leigh Syndrome with an Isolated Complex I Deficiency.,"Leigh syndrome is one of the most common neurological phenotypes observed in pediatric mitochondrial disease presentations. It is characterized by symmetrical lesions found on neuroimaging in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem and by a loss of motor skills and delayed developmental milestones. Genetic diagnosis of Leigh syndrome is complicated on account of the vast genetic heterogeneity with >75 candidate disease-associated genes having been reported to date. Candidate genes are still emerging, being identified when ""omics"" tools (genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics) are applied to manipulated cell lines and cohorts of clinically characterized individuals who lack a genetic diagnosis. NDUFAF8 is one such protein; it has been found to interact with the well-characterized complex I (CI) assembly factor NDUFAF5 in a large-scale protein-protein interaction screen. Diagnostic next-generation sequencing has identified three unrelated pediatric subjects, each with a clinical diagnosis of Leigh syndrome, who harbor bi-allelic pathogenic variants in NDUFAF8. These variants include a recurrent splicing variant that was initially overlooked due to its deep-intronic location. Subject fibroblasts were found to express a complex I deficiency, and lentiviral transduction with wild-type NDUFAF8-cDNA ameliorated both the assembly defect and the biochemical deficiency. Complexome profiling of subject fibroblasts demonstrated a complex I assembly defect, and the stalled assembly intermediates corroborate the role of NDUFAF8 in early complex I assembly. This report serves to expand the genetic heterogeneity associated with Leigh syndrome and to validate the clinical utility of orphan protein characterization. We also highlight the importance of evaluating intronic sequence when a single, definitively pathogenic variant is identified during diagnostic testing.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31231791,Novel TRRAP mutation causes autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss.,"Hereditary non-syndromic hearing loss is the most common inherited sensory defect in humans. More than 40 genes have been identified as causative genes for autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL), but there are many other candidate genes that remain to be discovered. We aimed to identify the causative gene mutation for post-lingual progressive ADNSHL in a Chinese family. Whole-exome sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, and Sanger sequencing were used to verify the co-segregation of a novel pathogenic variant (NM_ 001244580, c.511C>T, p.Arg171Cys) in the TRansformation/tRanscription domain-Associated Protein gene associated with hearing loss in a three-generation Chinese family with ADNSHL). Additionally, three more novel variants of transformation/transcription domain associated protein (TRRAP) were detected in 66 sporadic cases of hearing loss. Morpholino oligonucleotides knockdown and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 knockout zebrafish were constructed to validate the genetic findings. Knockdown or knockout of TRRAP resulted in significant defects in the inner ear of zebrafish, indicating that TRRAP plays an important role in inner ear development. In conclusion, TRRAP (NM_ 001244580, c.511C>T, p.Arg171Cys) co-segregated with hearing loss in a Chinese family with ADNSHL, and TRRAP deficiency caused hearing disability in zebrafish, suggesting TRRAP is a gene associated with ADNSHL.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
30879640,"A Syndromic Neurodevelopmental Disorder Caused by Mutations in SMARCD1, a Core SWI/SNF Subunit Needed for Context-Dependent Neuronal Gene Regulation in Flies.","Mutations in several genes encoding components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex cause neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we report on five individuals with mutations in SMARCD1; the individuals present with developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and small hands and feet. Trio exome sequencing proved the mutations to be de novo in four of the five individuals. Mutations in other SWI/SNF components cause Coffin-Siris syndrome, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, or other syndromic and non-syndromic NDDs. Although the individuals presented here have dysmorphisms and some clinical overlap with these syndromes, they lack their typical facial dysmorphisms. To gain insight into the function of SMARCD1 in neurons, we investigated the Drosophila ortholog Bap60 in postmitotic memory-forming neurons of the adult Drosophila mushroom body (MB). Targeted knockdown of Bap60 in the MB of adult flies causes defects in long-term memory. Mushroom-body-specific transcriptome analysis revealed that Bap60 is required for context-dependent expression of genes involved in neuron function and development in juvenile flies when synaptic connections are actively being formed in response to experience. Taken together, we identify an NDD caused by SMARCD1 mutations and establish a role for the SMARCD1 ortholog Bap60 in the regulation of neurodevelopmental genes during a critical time window of juvenile adult brain development when neuronal circuits that are required for learning and memory are formed.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30232381,Haploinsufficiency of vascular endothelial growth factor related signaling genes is associated with tetralogy of Fallot.,"PURPOSE:To determine disease-associated single-gene variants in conotruncal defects, particularly tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). METHODS:We analyzed for rare loss-of-function and deleterious variants in FLT4 (VEGFR3) and other genes in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, as part of a genome sequencing study involving 175 adults with TOF from a single site. RESULTS:We identified nine (5.1%) probands with novel FLT4 variants: seven loss-of-function, including an 8-kb deletion, and two predicted damaging. In ten other probands we found likely disruptive variants in VEGF-related genes: KDR (VEGFR2; two stopgain and two nonsynonymous variants), VEGFA, FGD5, BCAR1, IQGAP1, FOXO1, and PRDM1. Detection of VEGF-related variants (19/175, 10.9%) was associated with an increased prevalence of absent pulmonary valve (26.3% vs. 3.4%, p < 0.0001) and right aortic arch (52.6% vs. 29.1%, p = 0.029). Extracardiac anomalies were rare. In an attempt to replicate findings, we identified three loss-of-function or damaging variants in FLT4, KDR, and IQGAP1 in ten independent families with TOF. CONCLUSION:Loss-of-function variants in FLT4 and KDR contribute substantially to the genetic basis of TOF. The findings support dysregulated VEGF signaling as a novel mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of TOF.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

31736240,Rare SUZ12 variants commonly cause an overgrowth phenotype.,"The Polycomb repressive complex 2 is an epigenetic writer and recruiter with a role in transcriptional silencing. Constitutional pathogenic variants in its component proteins have been found to cause two established overgrowth syndromes: Weaver syndrome (EZH2-related overgrowth) and Cohen-Gibson syndrome (EED-related overgrowth). Imagawa et al. (2017) initially reported a singleton female with a Weaver-like phenotype with a rare coding SUZ12 variant-the same group subsequently reported two additional affected patients. Here we describe a further 10 patients (from nine families) with rare heterozygous SUZ12 variants who present with a Weaver-like phenotype. We report four frameshift, two missense, one nonsense, and two splice site variants. The affected patients demonstrate variable pre- and postnatal overgrowth, dysmorphic features, musculoskeletal abnormalities and developmental delay/intellectual disability. Some patients have genitourinary and structural brain abnormalities, and there may be an association with respiratory issues. The addition of these 10 patients makes a compelling argument that rare pathogenic SUZ12 variants frequently cause overgrowth, physical abnormalities, and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes in the heterozygous state. Pathogenic SUZ12 variants may be de novo or inherited, and are sometimes inherited from a mildly-affected parent. Larger samples sizes will be needed to elucidate whether one or more clinically-recognizable syndromes emerge from different variant subtypes.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31397523,"Mutations in PLS1, encoding fimbrin, cause autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss.","Nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), a common sensory disorder, is characterized by high clinical and genetic heterogeneity (i.e., approximately 115 genes and 170 loci so far identified). Nevertheless, almost half of patients submitted for genetic testing fail to receive a conclusive molecular diagnosis. We used next-generation sequencing to identify causal variants in PLS1 (c.805G>A, p.[E269K]; c.713G>T, p.[L238R], and c.383T>C, p.[F128S]) in three unrelated families of European ancestry with autosomal dominant NSHL. PLS1 encodes Plastin 1 (also called fimbrin), one of the most abundant actin-bundling proteins of the stereocilia. In silico protein modeling suggests that all variants destabilize the structure of the actin-binding domain 1, likely reducing the protein's ability to bind F actin. The role of PLS1 gene in hearing function is further supported by the recent demonstration that Pls1-/ - mice show a hearing loss phenotype similar to that of our patients. In summary, we report PLS1 as a novel gene for autosomal dominant NSHL, suggesting that this gene is required for normal hearing in humans and mice.",journal article
32001716,Loss-of-function mutations in UDP-Glucose 6-Dehydrogenase cause recessive developmental epileptic encephalopathy.,"Developmental epileptic encephalopathies are devastating disorders characterized by intractable epileptic seizures and developmental delay. Here, we report an allelic series of germline recessive mutations in UGDH in 36 cases from 25 families presenting with epileptic encephalopathy with developmental delay and hypotonia. UGDH encodes an oxidoreductase that converts UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, a key component of specific proteoglycans and glycolipids. Consistent with being loss-of-function alleles, we show using patients' primary fibroblasts and biochemical assays, that these mutations either impair UGDH stability, oligomerization, or enzymatic activity. In vitro, patient-derived cerebral organoids are smaller with a reduced number of proliferating neuronal progenitors while mutant ugdh zebrafish do not phenocopy the human disease. Our study defines UGDH as a key player for the production of extracellular matrix components that are essential for human brain development. Based on the incidence of variants observed, UGDH mutations are likely to be a frequent cause of recessive epileptic encephalopathy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
29460436,Truncating variants of the DLG4 gene are responsible for intellectual disability with marfanoid features.,"Marfanoid habitus (MH) combined with intellectual disability (ID) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of overlapping disorders. We performed exome sequencing in 33 trios and 31 single probands to identify novel genes specific to MH-ID. After the search for variants in known disease-causing genes and non-disease-causing genes with classical approaches, we searched for variants in non-disease-causing genes whose pLI was above 0.9 (ExAC Consortium data), in which truncating variants were found in at least 3 unrelated patients. Only DLG4 gene met these criteria. Data from the literature and various databases also indicated its implication in ID. DLG4 encodes post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), a protein expressed in various tissues, including the brain. In neurons, PSD-95 is located at the post-synaptic density, and is associated with glutamatergic receptor signaling (NMDA and AMPA). PSD-95 probably participates in dendritogenesis. Two patients were heterozygous for de novo frameshift variants and one patient carried a a consensus splice site variant. Gene expression studies supported their pathogenicity through haploinsufficiency and loss-of-function. Patients exhibited mild-to-moderate ID, similar marfanoid features, including a long face, high-arched palate, long and thin fingers, pectus excavatum, scoliosis and ophthalmological manifestations (nystagmus or strabismus). Our study emphasizes the role of DLG4 as a novel post-synaptic-associated gene involved in syndromic ID associated with MH.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
25220867,Association of a mutation in LACC1 with a monogenic form of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.,"The pathologic basis of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a subject of some controversy, with evidence for both autoimmune and autoinflammatory etiologies. Several monogenic autoinflammatory disorders have been described, but thus far, systemic JIA has only been attributed to a mutation of MEFV in rare cases and has been weakly associated with the HLA class II locus. This study was undertaken to identify the cause of an autosomal-recessive form of systemic JIA.We studied 13 patients with systemic JIA from 5 consanguineous families, all from the southern region of Saudi Arabia. We used linkage analysis, homozygosity mapping, and whole-exome sequencing to identify the disease-associated gene and mutation.Linkage analysis localized systemic JIA to a region on chromosome 13 with a maximum logarithm of odds score of 11.33, representing the strongest linkage identified to date for this disorder. Homozygosity mapping reduced the critical interval to a 1.02-Mb region defined proximally by rs9533338 and distally by rs9595049. Whole-exome sequencing identified a homoallelic missense mutation in LACC1, which encodes the enzyme laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase) domain-containing 1. The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with disease in all 5 families based on an autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance and complete penetrance.Our findings provide strong genetic evidence of an association of a mutation in LACC1 with systemic JIA in the families studied. Association of LACC1 with Crohn's disease and leprosy has been reported and justifies investigation of its role in autoinflammatory disorders.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
32004447,"Bi-allelic Variants in RALGAPA1 Cause Profound Neurodevelopmental Disability, Muscular Hypotonia, Infantile Spasms, and Feeding Abnormalities.","Ral (Ras-like) GTPases play an important role in the control of cell migration and have been implicated in Ras-mediated tumorigenicity. Recently, variants in RALA were also described as a cause of intellectual disability and developmental delay, indicating the relevance of this pathway to neuropediatric diseases. Here, we report the identification of bi-allelic variants in RALGAPA1 (encoding Ral GTPase activating protein catalytic alpha subunit 1) in four unrelated individuals with profound neurodevelopmental disability, muscular hypotonia, feeding abnormalities, recurrent fever episodes, and infantile spasms . Dysplasia of corpus callosum with focal thinning of the posterior part and characteristic facial features appeared to be unifying findings. RalGAPA1 was absent in the fibroblasts derived from two affected individuals suggesting a loss-of-function effect of the RALGAPA1 variants. Consequently, RalA activity was increased in these cell lines, which is in keeping with the idea that RalGAPA1 deficiency causes a constitutive activation of RalA. Additionally, levels of RalGAPB, a scaffolding subunit of the RalGAP complex, were dramatically reduced, indicating a dysfunctional RalGAP complex. Moreover, RalGAPA1 deficiency clearly increased cell-surface levels of lipid raft components in detached fibroblasts, which might indicate that anchorage-dependence of cell growth signaling is disturbed. Our findings indicate that the dysregulation of the RalA pathway has an important impact on neuronal function and brain development. In light of the partially overlapping phenotype between RALA- and RALGAPA1-associated diseases, it appears likely that dysregulation of the RalA signaling pathway leads to a distinct group of genetic syndromes that we suggest could be named RALopathies.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31928709,Delineation of a Human Mendelian Disorder of the DNA Demethylation Machinery: TET3 Deficiency.,"Germline pathogenic variants in chromatin-modifying enzymes are a common cause of pediatric developmental disorders. These enzymes catalyze reactions that regulate epigenetic inheritance via histone post-translational modifications and DNA methylation. Cytosine methylation (5-methylcytosine [5mC]) of DNA is the quintessential epigenetic mark, yet no human Mendelian disorder of DNA demethylation has yet been delineated. Here, we describe in detail a Mendelian disorder caused by the disruption of DNA demethylation. TET3 is a methylcytosine dioxygenase that initiates DNA demethylation during early zygote formation, embryogenesis, and neuronal differentiation and is intolerant to haploinsufficiency in mice and humans. We identify and characterize 11 cases of human TET3 deficiency in eight families with the common phenotypic features of intellectual disability and/or global developmental delay; hypotonia; autistic traits; movement disorders; growth abnormalities; and facial dysmorphism. Mono-allelic frameshift and nonsense variants in TET3 occur throughout the coding region. Mono-allelic and bi-allelic missense variants localize to conserved residues; all but one such variant occur within the catalytic domain, and most display hypomorphic function in an assay of catalytic activity. TET3 deficiency and other Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery show substantial phenotypic overlap, including features of intellectual disability and abnormal growth, underscoring shared disease mechanisms.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31168944,Refining the phenotype of the THG1L (p.Val55Ala mutation)-related mitochondrial autosomal recessive congenital cerebellar ataxia.,"Roughly 40 genes have been linked to autosomal recessive (AR) ataxia syndromes. Of these, at least 10 encode gene products localizing to the mitochondrion. tRNA-histidine guanylyltransferase 1 like (THG1L) localizes to the mitochondrion and catalyzes the 3'-5' addition of guanine to the 5'-end of tRNA-histidine. Previously, three siblings with early onset cerebellar dysfunction, developmental delay, pyramidal signs, and cerebellar atrophy on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were reported to carry homozygous V55A mutations in THG1L. Fibroblasts derived from these individuals showed abnormal mitochondrial networks when subjected to obligatory oxidative phosphorylation. A carrier rate of 0.8%, but no THG1L V55A homozygotes, was found in a cohort of 3,232 unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, and no homozygotes were found in Exac or gnomAD. This variant is reported with an allelic frequency of 0.02% in Exac, and is not listed in gnomAD. A similar phenotype was recently reported for another, homozygous variant p.L294P was reported with a similar, but more severely affected phenotype [Shaheen et al.

We present bioinformatic analyses of the V55A mutation demonstrating high conservation in metazoan species. We refine the clinical and radiological phenotype and discuss the uniqueness of the clinical course of this novel mitochondrial AR ataxia in comparison to the diverse molecular etiologies and clinical phenotypes of other known mitochondrial AR ataxias.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; review; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31978331,TTC12 Loss-of-Function Mutations Cause Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia and Unveil Distinct Dynein Assembly Mechanisms in Motile Cilia Versus Flagella.,"Cilia and flagella are evolutionarily conserved organelles whose motility relies on the outer and inner dynein arm complexes (ODAs and IDAs). Defects in ODAs and IDAs result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disease characterized by recurrent airway infections and male infertility. PCD mutations in assembly factors have been shown to cause a combined ODA-IDA defect, affecting both cilia and flagella. We identified four loss-of-function mutations in TTC12, which encodes a cytoplasmic protein, in four independent families in which affected individuals displayed a peculiar PCD phenotype characterized by the absence of ODAs and IDAs in sperm flagella, contrasting with the absence of only IDAs in respiratory cilia. Analyses of both primary cells from individuals carrying TTC12 mutations and human differentiated airway cells invalidated for TTC12 by a CRISPR-Cas9 approach revealed an IDA defect restricted to a subset of single-headed IDAs that are different in flagella and cilia, whereas TTC12 depletion in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia recapitulated the sperm phenotype. Overall, our study, which identifies TTC12 as a gene involved in PCD, unveils distinct dynein assembly mechanisms in human motile cilia versus flagella.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31484767,Homozygous NLRP1 gain-of-function mutation in siblings with a syndromic form of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.,"Juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JRRP) is a rare and debilitating childhood disease that presents with recurrent growth of papillomas in the upper airway. Two common human papillomaviruses (HPVs), HPV-6 and -11, are implicated in most cases, but it is still not understood why only a small proportion of children develop JRRP following exposure to these common viruses. We report 2 siblings with a syndromic form of JRRP associated with mild dermatologic abnormalities. Whole-exome sequencing of the patients revealed a private homozygous mutation in NLRP1, encoding Nucleotide-Binding Domain Leucine-Rich Repeat Family Pyrin Domain-Containing 1. We find the NLRP1 mutant allele to be gain of function (GOF) for inflammasome activation, as demonstrated by the induction of inflammasome complex oligomerization and IL-1β secretion in an overexpression system. Moreover, patient-derived keratinocytes secrete elevated levels of IL-1β at baseline. Finally, both patients displayed elevated levels of inflammasome-induced cytokines in the serum. Six NLRP1 GOF mutations have previously been described to underlie 3 allelic Mendelian diseases with differing phenotypes and modes of inheritance. Our results demonstrate that an autosomal recessive, syndromic form of JRRP can be associated with an NLRP1 GOF mutation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
32021605,NUP188 Biallelic Loss of Function May Underlie a New Syndrome: Nucleoporin 188 Insufficiency Syndrome?,"There is no clearly established association between the gene NUP188 and human pathology. Only a few reports of patients with different clinical presentation and different heterozygous or compound heterozygous missense or splice region variants have been identified in several sequencing projects; however, a causative association between the clinical features and the identified variants has not been established. For the first time, we report 2 unrelated patients with 2 different homozygous nonsense gene variants of NUP188, p.Tyr96* and p.Gln113*, respectively. Although having different supposedly truncating mutations, the patients presented with strikingly comparable phenotypes including pre- and postnatal microcephaly, trigonocephaly, congenital bilateral cataract, microphthalmia, cleft lip and palate or high-arched palate, camptodactyly, rocker-bottom feet, heart anomalies, specific brain changes (such as loss of periventricular white matter), thin corpus callosum, and delayed myelinization. Both patients showed very similar facial features such as laterally extended arched eyebrows, wide convex nose with a wide prominent nasal bridge, and prominent angulated antihelix. They were both born small for gestational age and died shortly after birth at the age of 67 and 140 days, respectively, as a result of central respiratory failure. Our findings strongly suggest a correlation between the homozygous nonsense gene variants of NUP188 and a severe phenotype of a new developmental syndrome with poor prognosis resulting from nucleoporin 188 homolog protein insufficiency.",research-article; journal article
32004446,Bi-allelic Variants in TKFC Encoding Triokinase/FMN Cyclase Are Associated with Cataracts and Multisystem Disease.,"We report an inborn error of metabolism caused by TKFC deficiency in two unrelated families. Rapid trio genome sequencing in family 1 and exome sequencing in family 2 excluded known genetic etiologies, and further variant analysis identified rare homozygous variants in TKFC. TKFC encodes a bifunctional enzyme involved in fructose metabolism through its glyceraldehyde kinase activity and in the generation of riboflavin cyclic 4',5'-phosphate (cyclic FMN) through an FMN lyase domain. The TKFC homozygous variants reported here are located within the FMN lyase domain. Functional assays in yeast support the deleterious effect of these variants on protein function. Shared phenotypes between affected individuals with TKFC deficiency include cataracts and developmental delay, associated with cerebellar hypoplasia in one case. Further complications observed in two affected individuals included liver dysfunction and microcytic anemia, while one had fatal cardiomyopathy with lactic acidosis following a febrile illness. We postulate that deficiency of TKFC causes disruption of endogenous fructose metabolism leading to generation of by-products that can cause cataract. In line with this, an affected individual had mildly elevated urinary galactitol, which has been linked to cataract development in the galactosemias. Further, in light of a previously reported role of TKFC in regulating innate antiviral immunity through suppression of MDA5, we speculate that deficiency of TKFC leads to impaired innate immunity in response to viral illness, which may explain the fatal illness observed in the most severely affected individual.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31447097,"Heterozygous FOXN1 Variants Cause Low TRECs and Severe T Cell Lymphopenia, Revealing a Crucial Role of FOXN1 in Supporting Early Thymopoiesis.","FOXN1 is the master regulatory gene of thymic epithelium development. FOXN1 deficiency leads to thymic aplasia, alopecia, and nail dystrophy, accounting for the nude/severe combined immunodeficiency (nu/SCID) phenotype in humans and mice. We identified several newborns with low levels of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and T cell lymphopenia at birth, who carried heterozygous loss-of-function FOXN1 variants. Longitudinal analysis showed persistent T cell lymphopenia during infancy, often associated with nail dystrophy. Adult individuals with heterozygous FOXN1 variants had in most cases normal CD4+ but lower than normal CD8+ cell counts. We hypothesized a FOXN1 gene dosage effect on the function of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and thymopoiesis and postulated that these effects would be more prominent early in life. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed TEC subset frequency and phenotype, early thymic progenitor (ETP) cell count, and expression of FOXN1 target genes (Ccl25, Cxcl12, Dll4, Scf, Psmb11, Prss16, and Cd83) in Foxn1nu/+ (nu/+) mice and age-matched wild-type (+/+) littermate controls. Both the frequency and the absolute count of ETP were significantly reduced in nu/+ mice up to 3 weeks of age. Analysis of the TEC compartment showed reduced expression of FOXN1 target genes and delayed maturation of the medullary TEC compartment in nu/+ mice. These observations establish a FOXN1 gene dosage effect on thymic function and identify FOXN1 haploinsufficiency as an important genetic determinant of T cell lymphopenia at birth.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
29302074,Genetics of intellectual disability in consanguineous families.,"Autosomal recessive (AR) gene defects are the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability (ID) in countries with frequent parental consanguinity, which account for about 1/7th of the world population. Yet, compared to autosomal dominant de novo mutations, which are the predominant cause of ID in Western countries, the identification of AR-ID genes has lagged behind. Here, we report on whole exome and whole genome sequencing in 404 consanguineous predominantly Iranian families with two or more affected offspring. In 219 of these, we found likely causative variants, involving 77 known and 77 novel AR-ID (candidate) genes, 21 X-linked genes, as well as 9 genes previously implicated in diseases other than ID. This study, the largest of its kind published to date, illustrates that high-throughput DNA sequencing in consanguineous families is a superior strategy for elucidating the thousands of hitherto unknown gene defects underlying AR-ID, and it sheds light on their prevalence.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31047799,Ataxia and dysarthria due to an ABCA2 variant: Extension of the phenotypic spectrum.,"INTRODUCTION:Ataxias are heterogeneous disorders that are caused by variants in a large number of genes. The study was conducted to identify the molecular basis of a movement disorder in a consanguineous Pakistani family. METHODS:We performed clinical assessments and magnetic resonance imaging of the older of two siblings affected with a movement disorder. Molecular analyses included whole-exome sequencing in order to delineate the underlying pathology of the disorder. Segregation of variants with the phenotype was checked by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS:Symptoms of the two affected subjects were consistent with cerebellar ataxia with dysarthria. Magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal brain abnormalities. The levels of low density lipid proteins were elevated in blood samples of both affected individuals. Whole-exome sequencing data analyses identified a frameshift variant, c.4993delG:p.(Val1665TyrfsTer36) in ABCA2 (NM_212533.2) which segregated with the disorder and was absent from all publicly available databases and ethnically matched controls. Although recessively inherited ABCA2 variants have been reported in two patients who had intellectual disability with global developmental delays, our study demonstrates the role of an ABCA2 variant in the pathogenesis of ataxia with dysarthria. The phenotype observed in our patients shows high concordance with that observed in Abca2 knockout mice. CONCLUSION:Our research links an ABCA2 variant with a distinct form of ataxia with dysarthria in humans and demonstrates pleiotropic effects due to the gene mutation. The findings further delineate the importance of low density lipid metabolism and intracellular sterol trafficking in brain function.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
31727539,Novel ATAD3A recessive mutation associated to fatal cerebellar hypoplasia with multiorgan involvement and mitochondrial structural abnormalities.,"Lethal neonatal encephalopathies are heterogeneous congenital disorders that can be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. Biallelic large deletions in the contiguous ATAD3B and ATAD3A genes, encoding mitochondrial inner membrane ATPases of unknown function, as well as compound heterozygous nonsense and missense mutations in the ATAD3A gene have been recently associated with fatal neonatal cerebellar hypoplasia. In this work, whole exome sequencing (WES) identified the novel homozygous variant c.1217 T > G in ATAD3A, predicting a p.(Leu406Arg) substitution, in four siblings from a consanguineous family presenting with fatal neonatal cerebellar hypoplasia, seizures, axial hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, congenital cataract, and dysmorphic facies. Biochemical phenotypes of the patients included hyperlactatemia and hypocholesterolemia. Healthy siblings and parents were heterozygous for this variant, which is predicted to introduce a polar chain within the catalytic domain of ATAD3A that shortens its beta-sheet structure, presumably affecting protein stability. Accordingly, patient's fibroblasts with the homozygous variant displayed a specific reduction in ATAD3A protein levels associated with profound ultrastructural alterations of mitochondrial cristae and morphology. Our findings exclude the causative role of ATAD3B on this severe phenotype, expand the phenotypical spectrum of ATAD3A pathogenic variants and emphasize the vital role of ATAD3A in mitochondrial biogenesis.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
29517768,Mitochondrial oxodicarboxylate carrier deficiency is associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion and spinal muscular atrophy-like disease.,"PURPOSE:To understand the role of the mitochondrial oxodicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A21) in the development of spinal muscular atrophy-like disease. METHODS:We identified a novel pathogenic variant in a patient by whole-exome sequencing. The pathogenicity of the mutation was studied by transport assays, computer modeling, followed by targeted metabolic testing and in vitro studies in human fibroblasts and neurons. RESULTS:The patient carries a homozygous pathogenic variant c.695A>G; p.(Lys232Arg) in the SLC25A21 gene, encoding the mitochondrial oxodicarboxylate carrier, and developed spinal muscular atrophy and mitochondrial myopathy. Transport assays show that the mutation renders SLC25A21 dysfunctional and 2-oxoadipate cannot be imported into the mitochondrial matrix. Computer models of central metabolism predicted that impaired transport of oxodicarboxylate disrupts the pathways of lysine and tryptophan degradation, and causes accumulation of 2-oxoadipate, pipecolic acid, and quinolinic acid, which was confirmed in the patient's urine by targeted metabolomics. Exposure to 2-oxoadipate and quinolinic acid decreased the level of mitochondrial complexes in neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y) and induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION:Mitochondrial oxodicarboxylate carrier deficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and the accumulation of oxoadipate and quinolinic acid, which in turn cause toxicity in spinal motor neurons leading to spinal muscular atrophy-like disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
32004445,Recurrent De Novo NAHR Reciprocal Duplications in the ATAD3 Gene Cluster Cause a Neurogenetic Trait with Perturbed Cholesterol and Mitochondrial Metabolism.,"Recent studies have identified both recessive and dominant forms of mitochondrial disease that result from ATAD3A variants. The recessive form includes subjects with biallelic deletions mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination. We report five unrelated neonates with a lethal metabolic disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, corneal opacities, encephalopathy, hypotonia, and seizures in whom a monoallelic reciprocal duplication at the ATAD3 locus was identified. Analysis of the breakpoint junction fragment indicated that these 67 kb heterozygous duplications were likely mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination at regions of high sequence identity in ATAD3A exon 11 and ATAD3C exon 7. At the recombinant junction, the duplication allele produces a fusion gene derived from ATAD3A and ATAD3C, the protein product of which lacks key functional residues. Analysis of fibroblasts derived from two affected individuals shows that the fusion gene product is expressed and stable. These cells display perturbed cholesterol and mitochondrial DNA organization similar to that observed for individuals with severe ATAD3A deficiency. We hypothesize that the fusion protein acts through a dominant-negative mechanism to cause this fatal mitochondrial disorder. Our data delineate a molecular diagnosis for this disorder, extend the clinical spectrum associated with structural variation at the ATAD3 locus, and identify a third mutational mechanism for ATAD3 gene cluster variants. These results further affirm structural variant mutagenesis mechanisms in sporadic disease traits, emphasize the importance of copy number analysis in molecular genomic diagnosis, and highlight some of the challenges of detecting and interpreting clinically relevant rare gene rearrangements from next-generation sequencing data.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31883643,Loss-of-Function Variants in PPP1R12A: From Isolated Sex Reversal to Holoprosencephaly Spectrum and Urogenital Malformations.,"In two independent ongoing next-generation sequencing projects for individuals with holoprosencephaly and individuals with disorders of sex development, and through international research collaboration, we identified twelve individuals with de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 12a (PPP1R12A), an important developmental gene involved in cell migration, adhesion, and morphogenesis. This gene has not been previously reported in association with human disease, and it has intolerance to LoF as illustrated by a very low observed-to-expected ratio of LoF variants in gnomAD. Of the twelve individuals, midline brain malformations were found in five, urogenital anomalies in nine, and a combination of both phenotypes in two. Other congenital anomalies identified included omphalocele, jejunal, and ileal atresia with aberrant mesenteric blood supply, and syndactyly. Six individuals had stop gain variants, five had a deletion or duplication resulting in a frameshift, and one had a canonical splice acceptor site loss. Murine and human in situ hybridization and immunostaining revealed PPP1R12A expression in the prosencephalic neural folds and protein localization in the lower urinary tract at critical periods for forebrain division and urogenital development. Based on these clinical and molecular findings, we propose the association of PPP1R12A pathogenic variants with a congenital malformations syndrome affecting the embryogenesis of the brain and genitourinary systems and including disorders of sex development.","brief-report; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
30478137,Biallelic disruption of PKDCC is associated with a skeletal disorder characterised by rhizomelic shortening of extremities and dysmorphic features.,"BACKGROUND:During mouse embryonic development the protein kinase domain containing, cytoplasmic (Pkdcc) gene, also known as Vlk, is expressed in several tissues including the ventral midbrain, with particularly strong expression in branchial arches and limb buds. Homozygous Pkdcc knockout mice have dysmorphic features and shortened long bones as the most obvious morphological abnormalities. The human PKDCC gene has currently not been associated with any disorders. OBJECTIVE:To use clinical diagnostic exome sequencing (DES) for providing genetic diagnoses to two apparently unrelated patients with similar skeletal abnormalities comprising rhizomelic shortening of limbs and dysmorphic features. METHODS:Patient-parents trio DES was carried out and the identified candidate variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS:Each patient had a homozygous gene disrupting variant in PKDCC considered to explain the skeletal phenotypes shared by both. The first patient was homozygous for the nonsense variant p.(Tyr217*) (NM_1 38 370 c.651C>A) expected to result in nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant transcripts, whereas the second patient was homozygous for the splice donor variant c.639+1G>T predicted to abolish the donor splice site by three in silico splice prediction algorithms. CONCLUSIONS:Biallelic gene disrupting variants in PKDCC in humans, just like in mice, cause dysmorphic features and rhizomelic shortening of limbs.",journal article

In contrast to other tissues, cardiac and skeletal muscle express two FXR1P isoforms that incorporate an additional exon-15. We report that recessive mutations in this particular exon of FXR1 cause congenital multi-minicore myopathy in humans and mice. Additionally, we show that while Myf5-dependent depletion of all FXR1P isoforms is neonatal lethal, mice carrying mutations in exon-15 display non-lethal myopathies which vary in severity depending on the specific effect of each mutation on the protein.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
32142645,Bi-allelic JAM2 Variants Lead to Early-Onset Recessive Primary Familial Brain Calcification.,"Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive decline associated with calcium deposition on brain imaging. To date, mutations in five genes have been linked to PFBC. However, more than 50% of individuals affected by PFBC have no molecular diagnosis. We report four unrelated families presenting with initial learning difficulties and seizures and later psychiatric symptoms, cerebellar ataxia, extrapyramidal signs, and extensive calcifications on brain imaging. Through a combination of homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, we mapped this phenotype to chromosome 21q21.3 and identified bi-allelic variants in JAM2. JAM2 encodes for the junctional-adhesion-molecule-2, a key tight-junction protein in blood-brain-barrier permeability. We show that JAM2 variants lead to reduction of JAM2 mRNA expression and absence of JAM2 protein in patient's fibroblasts, consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism. We show that the human phenotype is replicated in the jam2 complete knockout mouse (jam2 KO). Furthermore, neuropathology of jam2 KO mouse showed prominent vacuolation in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum and particularly widespread vacuolation in the midbrain with reactive astrogliosis and neuronal density reduction. The regions of the human brain affected on neuroimaging are similar to the affected brain areas in the myorg PFBC null mouse. Along with JAM3 and OCLN, JAM2 is the third tight-junction gene in which bi-allelic variants are associated with brain calcification, suggesting that defective cell-to-cell adhesion and dysfunction of the movement of solutes through the paracellular spaces in the neurovascular unit is a key mechanism in CNS calcification.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
32109419,"Opposite Modulation of RAC1 by Mutations in TRIO Is Associated with Distinct, Domain-Specific Neurodevelopmental Disorders.","The Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) TRIO acts as a key regulator of neuronal migration, axonal outgrowth, axon guidance, and synaptogenesis by activating the GTPase RAC1 and modulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Pathogenic variants in TRIO are associated with neurodevelopmental diseases, including intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here, we report the largest international cohort of 24 individuals with confirmed pathogenic missense or nonsense variants in TRIO. The nonsense mutations are spread along the TRIO sequence, and affected individuals show variable neurodevelopmental phenotypes. In contrast, missense variants cluster into two mutational hotspots in the TRIO sequence, one in the seventh spectrin repeat and one in the RAC1-activating GEFD1. Although all individuals in this cohort present with developmental delay and a neuro-behavioral phenotype, individuals with a pathogenic variant in the seventh spectrin repeat have a more severe ID associated with macrocephaly than do most individuals with GEFD1 variants, who display milder ID and microcephaly. Functional studies show that the spectrin and GEFD1 variants cause a TRIO-mediated hyper- or hypo-activation of RAC1, respectively, and we observe a striking correlation between RAC1 activation levels and the head size of the affected individuals. In addition, truncations in TRIO GEFD1 in the vertebrate model X. tropicalis induce defects that are concordant with the human phenotype. This work demonstrates distinct clinical and molecular disorders clustering in the GEFD1 and seventh spectrin repeat domains and highlights the importance of tight control of TRIO-RAC1 signaling in neuronal development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
30025130,Phenotype Variations Caused by Mutations in the RP1L1 Gene in a Large Mainly German Cohort.,"Purpose:Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa-1-like-1 (RP1L1) gene are the major cause of autosomal dominant occult macular dystrophy (OCMD), while recessive mutations have been linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP). We present the clinical phenotype of a large German OCMD cohort, as well as four RP patients. Methods:A total of 42 OCMD patients (27 families) and 4 arRP patients (3 families) with genetically confirmed mutations in RP1L1 were included. Genomic DNA was analyzed by targeted analysis of the c.133C>T;p.R45W mutation for all RP or macular dystrophy-related genes. All patients underwent ophthalmologic examination including psychophysical tests, electrophysiology, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Follow-up time was up to 12 years. Results:In 25 OCMD index patients genomic testing revealed the heterozygous mutation c.133C>T;p.R45W in RP1L1; one patient was homozygous for the mutation. Two OCMD patients displayed the variants c.3599G>A;p.G1200D and c.2849G>A;p.R950H, respectively, in a heterozygous state. All OCMD patients showed characteristic clinical findings and typical microstructural photoreceptor changes. Two arRP patients displayed the novel homozygous mutations c.3022C>T;p.Q1008* and c.1107G>A;p.W369*, respectively, while two RP-siblings carried the two heterozygous mutations c.455G>A;p.R152Q and c.5959C>T;p.Q1987*, the first also being novel. All arRP cases were mild with disease onset ≈30 years and preserved ERG-responses. Conclusions:OCMD phenotype showed consistent clinical findings including classical microstructural changes on SD-OCT. An important hallmark of RP1L1-related OCMD is the dominant family history with reduced penetrance. Furthermore, novel mutations in association with arRP were identified, outlining the complexity of the protein.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31833436,Novel homozygous loss-of-function mutations in RP1 and RP1L1 genes in retinitis pigmentosa patients.,Background: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group of ocular dystrophy. It is challenging to identify the underlying genetic defect in individuals with RP due to huge genetic heterogeneity. This study was designed to delineate the genetic defect(s) underlying RP in extended Saudi families and to describe the possible disease mechanism.Materials and Methods: Fundus photography and a high definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT) were performed in order to detect the earlier stages of macular degeneration. Genomic DNA was extracted followed by genome-wide SNP genotyping and whole exome sequencing (WES). Exome data was filtered to identify the genetic variant(s) of interest.Results: Clinical examination showed that affected individuals manifest key features of RP. The fundus exam shows pale optic disc and bone spicules at the periphery. OCT shows macular degeneration as early as at the age of 4Â years. Whole genome scan by SNPs identified multiple homozygous regions. WES identified a 10 bps novel insertion mutation (c.3544_3545insAGAAAAGCTG; p.Ala1182fs) in the RP1 gene in both affected individuals of family A. Affected individual from family B showed a large insertion of 48 nucleotides in the coding part of the RP1L1 gene (c.3955_3956insGGACTAAAGTAATAGAAGGGCTGCAAGAAGAGAGGGTGCAGTTAGAGG; p.Ala1319fs). Sanger sequencing validates the autosomal recessive inheritance of the mutations.Conclusion: The results strongly suggest that the insertion mutations in the RP1 and RP1L1 genes are responsible for the retinal phenotype in affected individuals from two families. Heterozygous individuals are asymptomatic carriers. We propose that the protective allele in other homozygous regions in heterozygous carriers contribute to the phenotypic variability in asymptomatic individuals.,journal article
30689892,CPSF1 mutations are associated with early-onset high myopia and involved in retinal ganglion cell axon projection.,"High myopia is a severe form of nearsightedness, which can result in blindness due to its associated complications. While both genetic and environmental factors can cause high myopia, early-onset high myopia (eoHM), which is defined as high myopia that occurs before school age, is considered to be caused mainly by genetic variations, with minimal environmental involvement. Here we report six rare heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants in CPSF1 that were identified in six of 623 probands with eoHM but none of 2657 probands with other forms of genetic eye diseases; this difference was statistically significant (P = 4.60 × 10-5, Fisher's exact test). The six variants, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, were c.3862_3871dup (p.F1291*), c.2823_2824del (p.V943Lfs*65), c.1858C>T (p.Q620*), c.15C>G (p.Y5*), c.3823G>T (p.D1275Y) and c.4146-2A>G. Five of these six variants were absent in existing databases, including gnomAD, 1000G and EVS. The remaining variant, c.4146-2A>G, was present in gnomAD with a frequency of 1/229918. Clinical data demonstrated eoHM in the six probands with these mutations. Knockdown of cpsf1 by morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) injection in zebrafish eggs resulted in small eye size in 84.38% of the injected larvae, and this phenotype was rescued in 61.39% of the zebrafish eggs when the cpsf1 MO and the cpsf1 mRNA were co-injected. The projection of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) towards the tectum was abnormal in cpsf1 morphants. Thus, we demonstrated that heterozygous LoF mutations in CPSF1 are associated with eoHM and that CPSF1 may play an important role in the development of RGC axon projection.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
32109420,De Novo Variants in SPOP Cause Two Clinically Distinct Neurodevelopmental Disorders.,"Recurrent somatic variants in SPOP are cancer specific; endometrial and prostate cancers result from gain-of-function and dominant-negative effects toward BET proteins, respectively. By using clinical exome sequencing, we identified six de novo pathogenic missense variants in SPOP in seven individuals with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms, and congenital anomalies. Two individuals shared craniofacial dysmorphisms, including congenital microcephaly, that were strikingly different from those of the other five individuals, who had (relative) macrocephaly and hypertelorism. We measured the effect of SPOP variants on BET protein amounts in human Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells and patient-derived cell lines because we hypothesized that variants would lead to functional divergent effects on BET proteins. The de novo variants c.362G>A (p.Arg121Gln) and c. 430G>A (p.Asp144Asn), identified in the first two individuals, resulted in a gain of function, and conversely, the c.73A>G (p.Thr25Ala), c.248A>G (p.Tyr83Cys), c.395G>T (p.Gly132Val), and c.412C>T (p.Arg138Cys) variants resulted in a dominant-negative effect. Our findings suggest that these opposite functional effects caused by the variants in SPOP result in two distinct and clinically recognizable syndromic forms of intellectual disability with contrasting craniofacial dysmorphisms.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31197650,De Novo and Inherited SETD1A Variants in Early-onset Epilepsy.,"Early-onset epilepsy is a neurological abnormality in childhood, and it is especially common in the first 2Â years after birth. Seizures in early life mostly result from structural or metabolic disorders in the brain, and the genetic causes of idiopathic seizures have been extensively investigated. In this study, we identified four missense mutations in the SETD1A gene (SET domain-containing 1A, histone lysine methyltransferase): three de novo mutations in three individuals and one inherited mutation in a four-generation family. Whole-exome sequencing indicated that all four of these mutations were responsible for the seizures. Mutations of SETD1A have been implicated in schizophrenia and developmental disorders, so we examined the role of the four mutations (R913C, Q269R, G1369R, and R1392H) in neural development. We found that their expression in mouse primary cortical neurons affected excitatory synapse development. Moreover, expression of the R913C mutation also affected the migration of cortical neurons in the mouse brain. We further identified two common genes (Neurl4 and Usp39) affected by mutations of SETD1A. These results suggested that the mutations of SETD1A play a fundamental role in abnormal synaptic function and the development of neurons, so they may be pathogenic factors for neurodevelopmental disorders.",journal article; case reports
30283131,Pathogenic variants in glutamyl-tRNAGln amidotransferase subunits cause a lethal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy disorder.,"Mitochondrial protein synthesis requires charging mt-tRNAs with their cognate amino acids by mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, with the exception of glutaminyl mt-tRNA (mt-tRNAGln). mt-tRNAGln is indirectly charged by a transamidation reaction involving the GatCAB aminoacyl-tRNA amidotransferase complex. Defects involving the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery cause a broad spectrum of disorders, with often fatal outcome. Here, we describe nine patients from five families with genetic defects in a GatCAB complex subunit, including QRSL1, GATB, and GATC, each showing a lethal metabolic cardiomyopathy syndrome. Functional studies reveal combined respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies and mitochondrial dysfunction.

30723320,"Biallelic pathogenic variants in the lanosterol synthase gene LSS involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis cause alopecia with intellectual disability, a rare recessive neuroectodermal syndrome.","PURPOSE:Lanosterol synthase (LSS) gene was initially described in families with extensive congenital cataracts. Recently, a study has highlighted LSS associated with hypotrichosis simplex. We expanded the phenotypic spectrum of LSS to a recessive neuroectodermal syndrome formerly named alopecia with mental retardation (APMR) syndrome. It is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by hypotrichosis and intellectual disability (ID) or developmental delay (DD), frequently associated with early-onset epilepsy and other dermatological features. METHODS:Through a multicenter international collaborative study, we identified LSS pathogenic variants in APMR individuals either by exome sequencing or LSS Sanger sequencing. Splicing defects were assessed by transcript analysis and minigene assay. RESULTS:We reported ten APMR individuals from six unrelated families with biallelic variants in LSS. We additionally identified one affected individual with a single rare variant in LSS and an allelic imbalance suggesting a second event. Among the identified variants, two were truncating, seven were missense, and two were splicing variants. Quantification of cholesterol and its precursors did not reveal noticeable imbalance. CONCLUSION:In the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, lanosterol synthase leads to the cyclization of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene into lanosterol. Our data suggest LSS as a major gene causing a rare recessive neuroectodermal syndrome.",journal article
31883645,Neuron-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Is Mutated in Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism.,"Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by infertility and the absence of puberty. Defects in GnRH neuron migration or altered GnRH secretion and/or action lead to a severe gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency. Given the close developmental association of GnRH neurons with the olfactory primary axons, CHH is often associated with anosmia or hyposmia, in which case it is defined as Kallmann syndrome (KS). The genetics of CHH are heterogeneous, and >40 genes are involved either alone or in combination. Several CHH-related genes controlling GnRH ontogeny encode proteins containing fibronectin-3 (FN3) domains, which are important for brain and neural development. Therefore, we hypothesized that defects in other FN3-superfamily genes would underlie CHH. Next-generation sequencing was performed for 240 CHH unrelated probands and filtered for rare, protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in FN3-superfamily genes. Compared to gnomAD controls the CHH cohort was statistically enriched for PTVs in neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) (p = 1.40 × 10-6). Three heterozygous PTVs (p.Lys62∗, p.Tyr128Thrfs∗55, and p.Trp469∗, all absent from the gnomAD database) and an additional heterozygous missense mutation (p.Thr201Ser) were found in four KS probands. Notably, NDNF is expressed along the GnRH neuron migratory route in both mouse embryos and human fetuses and enhances GnRH neuron migration. Further, knock down of the zebrafish ortholog of NDNF resulted in altered GnRH migration. Finally, mice lacking Ndnf showed delayed GnRH neuron migration and altered olfactory axonal projections to the olfactory bulb; both results are consistent with a role of NDNF in GnRH neuron development. Altogether, our results highlight NDNF as a gene involved in the GnRH neuron migration implicated in KS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31883644,Bi-allelic Mutations in NADSYN1 Cause Multiple Organ Defects and Expand the Genotypic Spectrum of Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorders.,"Birth defects occur in up to 3% of all live births and are the leading cause of infant death. Here we present five individuals from four unrelated families, individuals who share similar phenotypes with disease-causal bi-allelic variants in NADSYN1, encoding NAD synthetase 1, the final enzyme of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo synthesis pathway. Defects range from the isolated absence of both kidneys to multiple malformations of the vertebrae, heart, limbs, and kidney, and no affected individual survived for more than three months postnatally. NAD is an essential coenzyme for numerous cellular processes. Bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in genes required for the de novo synthesis of NAD were previously identified in individuals with multiple congenital abnormalities affecting the heart, kidney, vertebrae, and limbs. Functional assessments of NADSYN1 missense variants, through a combination of yeast complementation and enzymatic assays, show impaired enzymatic activity and severely reduced NAD levels. Thus, NADSYN1 represents an additional gene required for NAD synthesis during embryogenesis, and NADSYN1 has bi-allelic missense variants that cause NAD deficiency-dependent malformations. Our findings expand the genotypic spectrum of congenital NAD deficiency disorders and further implicate mutation of additional genes involved in de novo NAD synthesis as potential causes of complex birth defects.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
30929739,"De Novo and Inherited Pathogenic Variants in KDM3B Cause Intellectual Disability, Short Stature, and Facial Dysmorphism.","By using exome sequencing and a gene matching approach, we identified de novo and inherited pathogenic variants in KDM3B in 14 unrelated individuals and three affected parents with varying degrees of intellectual disability (ID) or developmental delay (DD) and short stature. The individuals share additional phenotypic features that include feeding difficulties in infancy, joint hypermobility, and characteristic facial features such as a wide mouth, a pointed chin, long ears, and a low columella. Notably, two individuals developed cancer, acute myeloid leukemia and Hodgkin lymphoma, in childhood. KDM3B encodes for a histone demethylase and is involved in H3K9 demethylation, a crucial part of chromatin modification required for transcriptional regulation. We identified missense and truncating variants, suggesting that KDM3B haploinsufficiency is the underlying mechanism for this syndrome. By using a hybrid facial-recognition model, we show that individuals with a pathogenic variant in KDM3B have a facial gestalt, and that they show significant facial similarity compared to control individuals with ID. In conclusion, pathogenic variants in KDM3B cause a syndrome characterized by ID, short stature, and facial dysmorphism.","brief-report; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
26224645,Immunodeficiency and severe susceptibility to bacterial infection associated with a loss-of-function homozygous mutation of MKL1.,"Megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1), also known as MAL or myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A), is a coactivator of serum response factor, which regulates transcription of actin and actin cytoskeleton-related genes. MKL1 is known to be important for megakaryocyte differentiation and function in mice, but its role in immune cells is unexplored. Here we report a patient with a homozygous nonsense mutation in the MKL1 gene resulting in immunodeficiency characterized predominantly by susceptibility to severe bacterial infection. We show that loss of MKL1 protein expression causes a dramatic loss of filamentous actin (F-actin) content in lymphoid and myeloid lineage immune cells and widespread cytoskeletal dysfunction. MKL1-deficient neutrophils displayed reduced phagocytosis and almost complete abrogation of migration in vitro. Similarly, primary dendritic cells were unable to spread normally or to form podosomes. Silencing of MKL1 in myeloid cell lines revealed that F-actin assembly was abrogated through reduction of globular actin (G-actin) levels and disturbed expression of multiple actin-regulating genes. Impaired migration of these cells was associated with failure of uropod retraction likely due to altered contractility and adhesion, evidenced by reduced expression of the myosin light chain 9 (MYL9) component of myosin II complex and overexpression of CD11b integrin. Together, our results show that MKL1 is a nonredundant regulator of cytoskeleton-associated functions in immune cells and fibroblasts and that its depletion underlies a novel human primary immunodeficiency.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
31610034,POPDC3 Gene Variants Associate with a New Form of Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy.,"OBJECTIVE:The Popeye domain containing 3 (POPDC3) gene encodes a membrane protein involved in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. Besides gastric cancer, no disease association has been described. We describe a new muscular dystrophy associated with this gene. METHODS:We screened 1,500 patients with unclassified limb girdle weakness or hyperCKemia for pathogenic POPDC3 variants. Five patients carrying POPDC3 variants were examined by muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), muscle biopsy, and cardiac examination. We performed functional analyses in a zebrafish popdc3 knockdown model and heterologous expression of the mutant proteins in Xenopus laevis oocytes to measure TREK-1 current. RESULTS:We identified homozygous POPDC3 missense variants (p.Leu155His, p.Leu217Phe, and p.Arg261Gln) in 5 patients from 3 ethnically distinct families. Variants affected highly conserved residues in the Popeye (p.Leu155 and p.Leu217) and carboxy-terminal (p.Arg261) domains. The variants were almost absent from control populations. Probands' muscle biopsies were dystrophic, and serum creatine kinase levels were 1,050 to 9,200U/l. Muscle weakness was proximal with adulthood onset in most patients and affected lower earlier than upper limbs. Muscle MRI revealed fat replacement of paraspinal and proximal leg muscles; cardiac investigations were unremarkable. Knockdown of popdc3 in zebrafish, using 2 different splice-site blocking morpholinos, resulted in larvae with tail curling and dystrophic muscle features. All 3 mutants cloned in Xenopus oocytes caused an aberrant modulation of the mechano-gated potassium channel, TREK-1. INTERPRETATION:Our findings point to an important role of POPDC3 for skeletal muscle function and suggest that pathogenic variants in POPDC3 are responsible for a novel type of autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy.

32300648,"Germline mutation of MDM4, a major p53 regulator, in a familial syndrome of defective telomere maintenance.","Dyskeratosis congenita is a cancer-prone inherited bone marrow failure syndrome caused by telomere dysfunction. A mouse model recently suggested that p53 regulates telomere metabolism, but the clinical relevance of this finding remained uncertain. Here, a germline missense mutation of MDM4, a negative regulator of p53, was found in a family with features suggestive of dyskeratosis congenita, e.g., bone marrow hypocellularity, short telomeres, tongue squamous cell carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. Using a mouse model, we show that this mutation (p.T454M) leads to increased p53 activity, decreased telomere length, and bone marrow failure. Variations in p53 activity markedly altered the phenotype of Mdm4 mutant mice, suggesting an explanation for the variable expressivity of disease symptoms in the family. Our data indicate that a germline activation of the p53 pathway may cause telomere dysfunction and point to polymorphisms affecting this pathway as potential genetic modifiers of telomere biology and bone marrow function.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
25653144,Hypervalinemia and hyperleucine-isoleucinemia caused by mutations in the branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase gene.,"Valine, leucine, and isoleucine are essential branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). When BCAA metabolism is genetically impaired in human, serum levels of BCAA and/or their metabolites rise considerably, causing severe neurological dysfunction. The first step in BCAA catabolism is catalyzed by branched chain aminotransferase (BCAT). Hypervalinemia and hyperleucine-isoleucinemia caused by BCAT gene mutation in human have not been reported previously. A 25-year-old man presented with headache complaints and mild memory impairment for about six years. Brain MRI showed symmetric white matter abnormal signals. Metabolic studies revealed remarkably elevated plasma valine and leucine concentrations. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) diagnosis was not supported since all genes for the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKD) gene were normal. Interestingly, two heterogeneous BCAT2 gene mutations were found in the patient, including c.509G > A (p.Arg170Gln) and c.790G > A (p.Glu264Lys). In addition, c.509G > A (p.Arg170Gln) and c.790G > A (p.Glu264Lys) were found in his father and mother, respectively, suggesting an autosomal recessive disorder. BCAT2 functional studies demonstrated that the two BCAT2 gene mutations resulted in decreased BCAT2 enzyme activity. After treatment with vitamin B6, the levels of BCAA, especially valine were remarkably decreased and brain MRI lesions were improved. These findings suggest a new type of branched chain amino acid metabolism disorder. This rare case provides great insight into the further understanding of BCAA metabolism and its defect in human. BCAT2 gene mutations can cause hypervalinemia and hyperleucine-isoleucinemia, which are associated with brain white matter lesions.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
30452684,Mutations of the mitochondrial carrier translocase channel subunit TIM22 cause early-onset mitochondrial myopathy.,"Protein import into mitochondria is facilitated by translocases within the outer and the inner mitochondrial membranes that are dedicated to a highly specific subset of client proteins. The mitochondrial carrier translocase (TIM22 complex) inserts multispanning proteins, such as mitochondrial metabolite carriers and translocase subunits (TIM23, TIM17A/B and TIM22), into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Both types of substrates are essential for mitochondrial metabolic function and biogenesis. Here, we report on a subject, diagnosed at 1.5 years, with a neuromuscular presentation, comprising hypotonia, gastroesophageal reflux disease and persistently elevated serum and Cerebrospinal fluid lactate (CSF). Patient fibroblasts displayed reduced oxidative capacity and altered mitochondrial morphology. Using trans-mitochondrial cybrid cell lines, we excluded a candidate variant in mitochondrial DNA as causative of these effects. Whole-exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants in the TIM22 gene (NM_013337), resulting in premature truncation in one allele (p.Tyr25Ter) and a point mutation in a conserved residue (p.Val33Leu), within the intermembrane space region, of the TIM22 protein in the second allele. Although mRNA transcripts of TIM22 were elevated, biochemical analyses revealed lower levels of TIM22 protein and an even greater deficiency of TIM22 complex formation. In agreement with a defect in carrier translocase function, carrier protein amounts in the inner membrane were found to be reduced. This is the first report of pathogenic variants in the TIM22 pore-forming subunit of the carrier translocase affecting the biogenesis of inner mitochondrial membrane proteins critical for metabolite exchange.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31827281,Mutations that prevent caspase cleavage of RIPK1 cause autoinflammatory disease.,"RIPK1 is a key regulator of innate immune signalling pathways. To ensure an optimal inflammatory response, RIPK1 is regulated post-translationally by well-characterized ubiquitylation and phosphorylation events, as well as by caspase-8-mediated cleavage1-7. The physiological relevance of this cleavage event remains unclear, although it is thought to inhibit activation of RIPK3 and necroptosis8. Here we show that the heterozygous missense mutations D324N, D324H and D324Y prevent caspase cleavage of RIPK1 in humans and result in an early-onset periodic fever syndrome and severe intermittent lymphadenopathy-a condition we term 'cleavage-resistant RIPK1-induced autoinflammatory syndrome'. To define the mechanism for this disease, we generated a cleavage-resistant Ripk1D325A mutant mouse strain. Whereas Ripk1-/- mice died postnatally from systemic inflammation, Ripk1D325A/D325A mice died during embryogenesis. Embryonic lethality was completely prevented by the combined loss of Casp8 and Ripk3, but not by loss of Ripk3 or Mlkl alone. Loss of RIPK1 kinase activity also prevented Ripk1D325A/D325A embryonic lethality, although the mice died before weaning from multi-organ inflammation in a RIPK3-dependent manner. Consistently, Ripk1D325A/D325A and Ripk1D325A/+ cells were hypersensitive to RIPK3-dependent TNF-induced apoptosis and necroptosis. Heterozygous Ripk1D325A/+ mice were viable and grossly normal, but were hyper-responsive to inflammatory stimuli in vivo. Our results demonstrate the importance of caspase-mediated RIPK1 cleavage during embryonic development and show that caspase cleavage of RIPK1 not only inhibits necroptosis but also maintains inflammatory homeostasis throughout life.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31827280,A dominant autoinflammatory disease caused by non-cleavable variants of RIPK1.,"Activation of RIPK1 controls TNF-mediated apoptosis, necroptosis and inflammatory pathways1. Cleavage of human and mouse RIPK1 after residues D324 and D325, respectively, by caspase-8 separates the RIPK1 kinase domain from the intermediate and death domains. The D325A mutation in mouse RIPK1 leads to embryonic lethality during mouse development2,3. However, the functional importance of blocking caspase-8-mediated cleavage of RIPK1 on RIPK1 activation in humans is unknown. Here we identify two families with variants in RIPK1 (D324V and D324H) that lead to distinct symptoms of recurrent fevers and lymphadenopathy in an autosomal-dominant manner. Impaired cleavage of RIPK1 D324 variants by caspase-8 sensitized patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells to RIPK1 activation, apoptosis and necroptosis induced by TNF. The patients showed strong RIPK1-dependent activation of inflammatory signalling pathways and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with unaffected controls. Furthermore, we show that expression of the RIPK1 mutants D325V or D325H in mouse embryonic fibroblasts confers not only increased sensitivity to RIPK1 activation-mediated apoptosis and necroptosis, but also induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF. By contrast, patient-derived fibroblasts showed reduced expression of RIPK1 and downregulated production of reactive oxygen species, resulting in resistance to necroptosis and ferroptosis. Together, these data suggest that human non-cleavable RIPK1 variants promote activation of RIPK1, and lead to an autoinflammatory disease characterized by hypersensitivity to apoptosis and necroptosis and increased inflammatory response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as a compensatory mechanism to protect against several pro-death stimuli in fibroblasts.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31250547,An emerging ribosomopathy affecting the skeleton due to biallelic variations in NEPRO.,"Cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH), anauxetic dysplasia 1, and anauxetic dysplasia 2 are rare metaphyseal dysplasias caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in RMRP and POP1, which encode the components of RNAse-MRP endoribonuclease complex (RMRP) in ribosomal biogenesis pathway. Nucleolus and neural progenitor protein (NEPRO), encoded by NEPRO (C3orf17), is known to interact with multiple protein subunits of RMRP. We ascertained a 6-year-old girl with skeletal dysplasia and some features of CHH. RMRP and POP1 did not harbor any causative variant in the proband. Parents-child trio exomes revealed a candidate biallelic variant, c.435G>C, p.(Leu145Phe) in NEPRO. Two families with four affected individuals with skeletal dysplasia and a homozygous missense variant, c.280C>T, p.(Arg94Cys) in NEPRO, were identified from literature and their published phenotype was compared in detail to the phenotype of the child we described. All the five affected individuals have severe short stature, brachydactyly, skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and joint dislocations. They also have short metacarpals, broad middle phalanges, and metaphyseal irregularities. Protein modeling and stability prediction showed that the mutant protein has decreased stability. Both the reported variants are in the same domain of the protein. Our report delineates the clinical and radiological characteristics of an emerging ribosomopathy caused by biallelic variants in NEPRO.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
31944455,Mutations in FASTKD2 are associated with mitochondrial disease with multi-OXPHOS deficiency.,"Mutations in FASTKD2, a mitochondrial RNA binding protein, have been associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with isolated complex IV deficiency. However, deficiencies related to other oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) complexes have not been reported. Here, we identified three novel FASTKD2 mutations, c.808_809insTTTCAGTTTTG, homoplasmic mutation c.868C>T, and heteroplasmic mutation c.1859delT/c.868C>T, in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Cell-based complementation assay revealed that these three FASTKD2 mutations were pathogenic. Mitochondrial functional analysis revealed that mutations in FASTKD2 impaired the mitochondrial function in patient-derived lymphocytes due to the deficiency in multi-OXPHOS complexes, whereas mitochondrial complex II remained unaffected. Consistent results were also found in human primary muscle cell and zebrafish with knockdown of FASTKD2. Furthermore, we discovered that FASTKD2 mutation is not inherently associated with epileptic seizures, optic atrophy, and loss of visual function. Alternatively, a patient with FASTKD2 mutation can show sinus tachycardia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which was partially confirmed in zebrafish with knockdown of FASTKD2. In conclusion, both in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that loss of function mutation in FASTKD2 is responsible for multi-OXPHOS complexes deficiency, and FASTKD2-associated mitochondrial disease has a high degree of clinical heterogenicity.",journal article
27799409,ACBD5 deficiency causes a defect in peroxisomal very long-chain fatty acid metabolism.,"BACKGROUND:Acyl-CoA binding domain containing protein 5 (ACBD5) is a peroxisomal membrane protein with a cytosolic acyl-CoA binding domain. Because of its acyl-CoA binding domain, ACBD5 has been assumed to function as an intracellular carrier of acyl-CoA esters. In addition, a role for ACBD5 in pexophagy has been suggested. However, the precise role of ACBD5 in peroxisomal metabolism and/or functioning has not yet been established. Previously, a genetic ACBD5 deficiency was identified in three siblings with retinal dystrophy and white matter disease. We identified a pathogenic mutation in ACBD5 in another patient and studied the consequences of the ACBD5 defect in patient material and in ACBD5-deficient HeLa cells to uncover this role. METHODS:We studied a girl who presented with progressive leukodystrophy, syndromic cleft palate, ataxia and retinal dystrophy. We performed biochemical, cell biological and molecular studies in patient material and in ACBD5-deficient HeLa cells generated by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. RESULTS:We identified a homozygous deleterious indel mutation in ACBD5, leading to complete loss of ACBD5 protein in the patient. Our studies showed that ACBD5 deficiency leads to accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) due to impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation. No effect on pexophagy was found. CONCLUSIONS:Our investigations strongly suggest that ACBD5 plays an important role in sequestering C26-CoA in the cytosol and thereby facilitates transport into the peroxisome and subsequent β-oxidation. Accordingly, ACBD5 deficiency is a novel single peroxisomal enzyme deficiency caused by impaired VLCFA metabolism, leading to retinal dystrophy and white matter disease.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
31819945,Expansion of GGC repeat in the human-specific NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with essential tremor.,"Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders. Despite its high prevalence and heritability, the genetic aetiology of essential tremor remains elusive. Up to now, only a few genes/loci have been identified, but these genes have not been replicated in other essential tremor families or cohorts. Here we report a genetic study in a cohort of 197 Chinese pedigrees clinically diagnosed with essential tremor. Using a comprehensive strategy combining linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, long-read whole-genome sequencing, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and GC-rich polymerase chain reaction, we identified an abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5' region of the NOTCH2NLC gene that co-segregated with disease in 11 essential tremor families (5.58%) from our cohort. Clinically, probands that had an abnormal GGC repeat expansion were found to have more severe tremor phenotypes, lower activities of daily living ability. Obvious genetic anticipation was also detected in these 11 essential tremor-positive families. These results indicate that abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5' region of NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with essential tremor, and provide strong evidence that essential tremor is a family of diseases with high clinical and genetic heterogeneities.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
31855247,Choline transporter-like 1 deficiency causes a new type of childhood-onset neurodegeneration.,"Cerebral choline metabolism is crucial for normal brain function, and its homoeostasis depends on carrier-mediated transport. Here, we report on four individuals from three families with neurodegenerative disease and homozygous frameshift mutations (Asp517Metfs*19, Ser126Metfs*8, and Lys90Metfs*18) in the SLC44A1 gene encoding choline transporter-like protein 1. Clinical features included progressive ataxia, tremor, cognitive decline, dysphagia, optic atrophy, dysarthria, as well as urinary and bowel incontinence. Brain MRI demonstrated cerebellar atrophy and leukoencephalopathy. Moreover, low signal intensity in globus pallidus with hyperintensive streaking and low signal intensity in substantia nigra were seen in two individuals. The Asp517Metfs*19 and Ser126Metfs*8 fibroblasts were structurally and functionally indistinguishable. The most prominent ultrastructural changes of the mutant fibroblasts were reduced presence of free ribosomes, the appearance of elongated endoplasmic reticulum and strikingly increased number of mitochondria and small vesicles. When chronically treated with choline, those characteristics disappeared and mutant ultrastructure resembled healthy control cells. Functional analysis revealed diminished choline transport yet the membrane phosphatidylcholine content remained unchanged. As part of the mechanism to preserve choline and phosphatidylcholine, choline transporter deficiency was implicated in impaired membrane homeostasis of other phospholipids. Choline treatments could restore the membrane lipids, repair cellular organelles and protect mutant cells from acute iron overload. In conclusion, we describe a novel childhood-onset neurometabolic disease caused by choline transporter deficiency with autosomal recessive inheritance.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"

METHODS:We describe an international cohort of seven affected individuals harboring variants involving MED12L identified by array CGH, exome or genome sequencing. RESULTS:All affected individuals presented with intellectual disability and/or developmental delay, including speech impairment. Other features included autism spectrum disorder, aggressive behavior, corpus callosum abnormality, and mild facial morphological features. Three individuals had a MED12L deletion or duplication. The other four individuals harbored single-nucleotide variants (one nonsense, one frameshift, and two splicing variants). Functional analysis confirmed a moderate and significant alteration of RNA synthesis in two individuals.

Our findings confirm that the integrity of this kinase module is a critical factor for neurological development.","research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
32097630,Pathogenic Variants in CEP85L Cause Sporadic and Familial Posterior Predominant Lissencephaly.,"Lissencephaly (LIS), denoting a ""smooth brain,"" is characterized by the absence of normal cerebral convolutions with abnormalities of cortical thickness. Pathogenic variants in over 20 genes are associated with LIS. The majority of posterior predominant LIS is caused by pathogenic variants in LIS1 (also known as PAFAH1B1), although a significant fraction remains without a known genetic etiology. We now implicate CEP85L as an important cause of posterior predominant LIS, identifying 13 individuals with rare, heterozygous CEP85L variants, including 2 families with autosomal dominant inheritance. We show that CEP85L is a centrosome protein localizing to the pericentriolar material, and knockdown of Cep85l causes a neuronal migration defect in mice. LIS1 also localizes to the centrosome, suggesting that this organelle is key to the mechanism of posterior predominant LIS.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
32197075,Bi-allelic LoF NRROS Variants Impairing Active TGF-β1 Delivery Cause a Severe Infantile-Onset Neurodegenerative Condition with Intracranial Calcification.,"Negative regulator of reactive oxygen species (NRROS) is a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein that uniquely associates with latent transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF- β1) and anchors it on the cell surface; this anchoring is required for activation of TGF-β1 in macrophages and microglia. We report six individuals from four families with bi-allelic variants in NRROS. All affected individuals had neurodegenerative disease with refractory epilepsy, developmental regression, and reduced white matter volume with delayed myelination. The clinical course in affected individuals began with normal development or mild developmental delay, and the onset of seizures occurred within the first year of life, followed by developmental regression. Intracranial calcification was detected in three individuals. The phenotypic features in affected individuals are consistent with those observed in the Nrros knockout mouse, and they overlap with those seen in the human condition associated with TGF-β1 deficiency. The disease-causing NRROS variants involve two significant functional NRROS domains. These variants result in aberrant NRROS proteins with impaired ability to anchor latent TGF-β1 on the cell surface. Using confocal microscopy in HEK293T cells, we demonstrate that wild-type and mutant NRROS proteins co-localize with latent TGF-β1 intracellularly. However, using flow cytometry, we show that our mutant NRROS proteins fail to anchor latent TGF-β1 at the cell surface in comparison to wild-type NRROS. Moreover, wild-type NRROS rescues the defect of our disease-associated mutants in presenting latent TGF-β1 to the cell surface. Taken together, our findings suggest that loss of NRROS function causes a severe childhood-onset neurodegenerative condition with features suggestive of a disordered response to inflammation.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
32169168,De Novo Truncating Variants in the Last Exon of SEMA6B Cause Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy.,"De novo variants (DNVs) cause many genetic diseases. When DNVs are examined in the whole coding regions of genes in next-generation sequencing analyses, pathogenic DNVs often cluster in a specific region. One such region is the last exon and the last 50 bp of the penultimate exon, where truncating DNVs cause escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [NMD(-) region]. Such variants can have dominant-negative or gain-of-function effects. Here, we first developed a resource of rates of truncating DNVs in NMD(-) regions under the null model of DNVs. Utilizing this resource, we performed enrichment analysis of truncating DNVs in NMD(-) regions in 346 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) trios. We observed statistically significant enrichment of truncating DNVs in semaphorin 6B (SEMA6B) (p value: 2.8 × 10-8; exome-wide threshold: 2.5 × 10-6). The initial analysis of the 346 individuals and additional screening of 1,406 and 4,293 independent individuals affected by DEE and developmental disorders collectively identified four truncating DNVs in the SEMA6B NMD(-) region in five individuals who came from unrelated families (p value: 1.9 × 10-13) and consistently showed progressive myoclonic epilepsy. RNA analysis of lymphoblastoid cells established from an affected individual showed that the mutant allele escaped NMD, indicating stable production of the truncated protein. Importantly, heterozygous truncating variants in the NMD(+) region of SEMA6B are observed in general populations, and SEMA6B is most likely loss-of-function tolerant. Zebrafish expressing truncating variants in the NMD(-) region of SEMA6B orthologs displayed defective development of brain neurons and enhanced pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure behavior. In summary, we show that truncating DNVs in the final exon of SEMA6B cause progressive myoclonic epilepsy.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
32197074,"De novo EIF2AK1 and EIF2AK2 Variants Are Associated with Developmental Delay, Leukoencephalopathy, and Neurologic Decompensation.","EIF2AK1 and EIF2AK2 encode members of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase (EIF2AK) family that inhibits protein synthesis in response to physiologic stress conditions. EIF2AK2 is also involved in innate immune response and the regulation of signal transduction, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Despite these findings, human disorders associated with deleterious variants in EIF2AK1 and EIF2AK2 have not been reported. Here, we describe the identification of nine unrelated individuals with heterozygous de novo missense variants in EIF2AK1 (1/9) or EIF2AK2 (8/9). Features seen in these nine individuals include white matter alterations (9/9), developmental delay (9/9), impaired language (9/9), cognitive impairment (8/9), ataxia (6/9), dysarthria in probands with verbal ability (6/9), hypotonia (7/9), hypertonia (6/9), and involuntary movements (3/9). Individuals with EIF2AK2 variants also exhibit neurological regression in the setting of febrile illness or infection. We use mammalian cell lines and proband-derived fibroblasts to further confirm the pathogenicity of variants in these genes and found reduced kinase activity. EIF2AKs phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (EIF2S1, also known as EIF2α), which then inhibits EIF2B activity. Deleterious variants in genes encoding EIF2B proteins cause childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination/vanishing white matter (CACH/VWM), a leukodystrophy characterized by neurologic regression in the setting of febrile illness and other stressors. Our findings indicate that EIF2AK2 missense variants cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome that may share phenotypic and pathogenic mechanisms with CACH/VWM.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
32220290,"Bi-allelic Variants in the GPI Transamidase Subunit PIGK Cause a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome with Hypotonia, Cerebellar Atrophy, and Epilepsy.","Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are critical for embryogenesis, neurogenesis, and cell signaling. Variants in several genes participating in GPI biosynthesis and processing lead to decreased cell surface presence of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) and cause inherited GPI deficiency disorders (IGDs). In this report, we describe 12 individuals from nine unrelated families with 10 different bi-allelic PIGK variants. PIGK encodes a component of the GPI transamidase complex, which attaches the GPI anchor to proteins. Clinical features found in most individuals include global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, and facial dysmorphisms. The majority of the individuals have epilepsy. Two individuals have slightly decreased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, while eight do not. Flow cytometric analysis of blood and fibroblasts from affected individuals showed decreased cell surface presence of GPI-APs. The overexpression of wild-type (WT) PIGK in fibroblasts rescued the levels of cell surface GPI-APs. In a knockout cell line, transfection with WT PIGK also rescued the GPI-AP levels, but transfection with the two tested mutant variants did not. Our study not only expands the clinical and known genetic spectrum of IGDs, but it also expands the genetic differential diagnosis for cerebellar atrophy. Given the fact that cerebellar atrophy is seen in other IGDs, flow cytometry for GPI-APs should be considered in the work-ups of individuals presenting this feature.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
30007336,COL18A1 is a candidate eye iridocorneal angle-closure gene in humans.,"Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is a common form of glaucoma in the Far East. Its defining feature is iridocorneal angle closure. In addition to PACG, indications of angle closure are included in the diagnostic criteria of related conditions primary angle-closure suspect (PACS) and primary angle closure (PAC). To the best of our knowledge, a causative gene for iridocorneal angle closure in humans has not been identified. This study aimed to identify the genetic cause of iridocorneal angle closure in a pedigree with at least 10 individuals diagnosed with PACS, PAC or PACG. Results of linkage analysis, segregation analysis of 44 novel variations, whole exome sequencing of 10 individuals, screenings of controls and bioinformatics predictions identified a mutation in COL18A1 that encodes collagen type XVIII as the most likely cause of angle closure in the pedigree. The role of COL18A1 in the etiology of Knobloch syndrome (KS) that is consistently accompanied by optic anomalies, available functional data on the encoded protein and the recognized role of collagens and the extracellular matrix in glaucoma pathogenesis supported the proposed role of the COL18A1 mutation in the pedigree. Subsequent identification of other COL18A1 mutations in PACS affected individuals of two unrelated families further supported that COL18A1 may affect angle closure. These PACS individuals were parents and grandparents of KS-affected children. In conclusion, a gene that affects angle closure in humans, a critical feature of PACG, has been identified. The findings also reinforce the importance of collagens in eye features and functions.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
30451973,Biallelic GALM pathogenic variants cause a novel type of galactosemia.,"PURPOSE:Galactosemia is caused by metabolic disturbances at various stages of galactose metabolism, including deficiencies in enzymes involved in the Leloir pathway (GALT, GALK1, and GALE). Nevertheless, the etiology of galactosemia has not been identified in a subset of patients. This study aimed to explore the causes of unexplained galactosemia. METHODS:Trio-based exome sequencing and/or Sanger sequencing was performed in eight patients with unexplained congenital galactosemia. In vitro enzymatic assays and immunoblot assays were performed to confirm the pathogenicity of the variants. RESULTS:The highest blood galactose levels observed in each patient were 17.3-41.9 mg/dl. Bilateral cataracts were observed in two patients. In all eight patients, we identified biallelic variants (p.Arg82*, p.Ile99Leufs*46, p.Gly142Arg, p.Arg267Gly, and p.Trp311*) in the GALM encoding galactose mutarotase, which catalyzes epimerization between β- and α-D-galactose in the first step of the Leloir pathway. GALM enzyme activities were undetectable in lymphoblastoid cell lines established from two patients. Immunoblot analysis showed the absence of the GALM protein in the patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In vitro GALM expression and protein stability assays revealed altered stabilities of the variant GALM proteins. CONCLUSION:Biallelic GALM pathogenic variants cause galactosemia, suggesting the existence of type IV galactosemia.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
24156255,Detailed investigations of proximal tubular function in Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Imerslund-Gräsbeck Syndrome (IGS) is a rare genetic disorder characterised by juvenile megaloblastic anaemia. IGS is caused by mutations in either of the genes encoding the intestinal intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 receptor complex, cubam. The cubam receptor proteins cubilin and amnionless are both expressed in the small intestine as well as the proximal tubules of the kidney and exhibit an interdependent relationship for post-translational processing and trafficking. In the proximal tubules cubilin is involved in the reabsorption of several filtered plasma proteins including vitamin carriers and lipoproteins. Consistent with this, low-molecular-weight proteinuria has been observed in most patients with IGS. The aim of this study was to characterise novel disease-causing mutations and correlate novel and previously reported mutations with the presence of low-molecular-weight proteinuria. METHODS: Genetic screening was performed by direct sequencing of the CUBN and AMN genes and novel identified mutations were characterised by in silico and/or in vitro investigations. Urinary protein excretion was analysed by immunoblotting and high-resolution gel electrophoresis of collected urines from patients and healthy controls to determine renal phenotype. RESULTS: Genetic characterisation of nine IGS patients identified two novel AMN frameshift mutations alongside a frequently reported AMN splice site mutation and two CUBN missense mutations; one novel and one previously reported in Finnish patients. The novel AMN mutations were predicted to result in functionally null AMN alleles with no cell-surface expression of cubilin. Also, the novel CUBN missense mutation was predicted to affect structural integrity of the IF-B12 binding site of cubilin and hereby most likely cubilin cell-surface expression. Analysis of urinary protein excretion in the patients and 20 healthy controls revealed increased urinary excretion of cubilin ligands including apolipoprotein A-I, transferrin, vitamin D-binding protein, and albumin. This was, however, only observed in patients where plasma membrane expression of cubilin was predicted to be perturbed. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, mutational characterisation of nine IGS patients coupled with analyses of urinary protein excretion provide additional evidence for a correlation between mutation type and presence of the characteristic low-molecular-weight proteinuria.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article"
31613795,Human C-terminal CUBN variants associate with chronic proteinuria and normal renal function.,"BACKGROUNDProteinuria is considered an unfavorable clinical condition that accelerates renal and cardiovascular disease. However, it is not clear whether all forms of proteinuria are damaging. Mutations in CUBN cause Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (IGS), which is characterized by intestinal malabsorption of vitamin B12 and in some cases proteinuria. CUBN encodes for cubilin, an intestinal and proximal tubular uptake receptor containing 27 CUB domains for ligand binding.METHODSWe used next-generation sequencing for renal disease genes to genotype cohorts of patients with suspected hereditary renal disease and chronic proteinuria. CUBN variants were analyzed using bioinformatics, structural modeling, and epidemiological methods.RESULTSWe identified 39 patients, in whom biallelic pathogenic variants in the CUBN gene were associated with chronic isolated proteinuria and early childhood onset. Since the proteinuria in these patients had a high proportion of albuminuria, glomerular diseases such as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or Alport syndrome were often the primary clinical diagnosis, motivating renal biopsies and the use of proteinuria-lowering treatments. However, renal function was normal in all cases. By contrast, we did not found any biallelic CUBN variants in proteinuric patients with reduced renal function or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Unlike the more N-terminal IGS mutations, 37 of the 41 proteinuria-associated CUBN variants led to modifications or truncations after the vitamin B12-binding domain. Finally, we show that 4 C-terminal CUBN variants are associated with albuminuria and slightly increased GFR in meta-analyses of large population-based cohorts.CONCLUSIONCollectively, our data suggest an important role for the C-terminal half of cubilin in renal albumin reabsorption. Albuminuria due to reduced cubilin function could be an unexpectedly common benign condition in humans that may not require any proteinuria-lowering treatment or renal biopsy.FUNDINGATIP-Avenir program, Fondation Bettencourt-Schueller (Liliane Bettencourt Chair of Developmental Biology), Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) Investissements d'avenir program (ANR-10-IAHU-01) and NEPHROFLY (ANR-14-ACHN-0013, to MS), Steno Collaborative Grant 2018 (NNF18OC0052457, to TSA and MS), Heisenberg Professorship of the German Research Foundation (KO 3598/5-1, to AK), Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Collaborative Research Centre (SFB) KIDGEM 1140 (project 246781735, to CB), and Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMB) (01GM1515C, to CB).","clinical trial; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; multicenter study; journal article"
32293671,Novel congenital disorder of O-linked glycosylation caused by GALNT2 loss of function.,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation are a growing group of rare genetic disorders caused by deficient protein and lipid glycosylation. Here, we report the clinical, biochemical, and molecular features of seven patients from four families with GALNT2-congenital disorder of glycosylation (GALNT2-CDG), an O-linked glycosylation disorder. GALNT2 encodes the Golgi-localized polypeptide N-acetyl-d-galactosamine-transferase 2 isoenzyme. GALNT2 is widely expressed in most cell types and directs initiation of mucin-type protein O-glycosylation. All patients showed loss of O-glycosylation of apolipoprotein C-III, a non-redundant substrate for GALNT2. Patients with GALNT2-CDG generally exhibit a syndrome characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability with language deficit, autistic features, behavioural abnormalities, epilepsy, chronic insomnia, white matter changes on brain MRI, dysmorphic features, decreased stature, and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Rodent (mouse and rat) models of GALNT2-CDG recapitulated much of the human phenotype, including poor growth and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. In behavioural studies, GALNT2-CDG mice demonstrated cerebellar motor deficits, decreased sociability, and impaired sensory integration and processing. The multisystem nature of phenotypes in patients and rodent models of GALNT2-CDG suggest that there are multiple non-redundant protein substrates of GALNT2 in various tissues, including brain, which are critical to normal growth and development.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
31263216,"The Liberfarb syndrome, a multisystem disorder affecting eye, ear, bone, and brain development, is caused by a founder pathogenic variant in thePISD gene.","PURPOSE:We observed four individuals in two unrelated but consanguineous families from Portugal and Brazil affected by early-onset retinal degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual disability, and skeletal dysplasia with scoliosis and short stature. The phenotype precisely matched that of an individual of Azorean descent published in 1986 by Liberfarb and coworkers. METHODS:Patients underwent specialized clinical examinations (including ophthalmological, audiological, orthopedic, radiological, and developmental assessment). Exome and targeted sequencing was performed on selected individuals. Minigene constructs were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS:Affected individuals shared a 3.36-Mb region of autozygosity on chromosome 22q12.2, including a 10-bp deletion (NM_014338.3:c.904-12_904-3delCTATCACCAC), immediately upstream of the last exon of the PISD (phosphatidylserine decarboxylase) gene. Sequencing of PISD from paraffin-embedded tissue from the 1986 case revealed the identical homozygous variant. In HEK293T cells, this variant led to aberrant splicing of PISD transcripts. CONCLUSION:We have identified the genetic etiology of the Liberfarb syndrome, affecting brain, eye, ear, bone, and connective tissue. Our work documents the migration of a rare Portuguese founder variant to two continents and highlights the link between phospholipid metabolism and bone formation, sensory defects, and cerebral development, while raising the possibility of therapeutic phospholipid replacement.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
27274160,Agenesis of Permanent Mandibular Central Incisors: A Concordant Condition in Siblings.,"Concordance is an identical expression of phenotype in two related individuals. Concordance expression of hypodontia is an uncommon condition where associated individuals are affected with exactly similar kind and number of missing teeth. There is very limited documentation of this condition either in twins or in siblings, and literature shows paucity of data with regard to this anomaly. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one such case reported in the literature, which has actually showed similar missing lower central incisors in siblings. This report presents a case of two girl siblings aged 11 and 13 years with congenital bilateral missing of permanent mandibular central incisors, which is an absolute concordant condition. Apart from discussing etiology, clinical implications and management, this article highlights the significance of concordant and discordant condition of hypodontia and expression of this condition in twins and siblings.

21660509,Mutations of GIPC3 cause nonsyndromic hearing loss DFNB72 but not DFNB81 that also maps to chromosome 19p.,"A missense mutation of Gipc3 was previously reported to cause age-related hearing loss in mice. Point mutations of human GIPC3 were found in two small families, but association with hearing loss was not statistically significant. Here, we describe one frameshift and six missense mutations in GIPC3 cosegregating with DFNB72 hearing loss in six large families that support statistically significant evidence for genetic linkage. However, GIPC3 is not the only nonsyndromic hearing impairment gene in this region; no GIPC3 mutations were found in a family cosegregating hearing loss with markers of chromosome 19p. Haplotype analysis excluded GIPC3 from the obligate linkage interval in this family and defined a novel locus spanning 4.08Â Mb and 104 genes. This closely linked but distinct nonsyndromic hearing loss locus was designated DFNB81.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; research support, n.i.h., extramural"
15841483,Identification of a novel frameshift mutation in the DFNB31/WHRN gene in a Tunisian consanguineous family with hereditary non-syndromic recessive hearing loss.,"Approximately 80% of hereditary hearing loss is non-syndromic. Non-syndromic deafness is the most genetically heterogeneous trait. The most common and severe form of hereditary hearing impairment is autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL), accounting for approximately 80% of cases of genetic deafness. To date, 22 genes implicated in ARNSHL have been identified. Recently a gene, DFNB31/WHRN, which encodes a putative PDZ scaffold protein called whirlin, was found to be responsible for the ARNSHL DFNB31. We found evidence for linkage to the DFNB31locus in a consanguineous Tunisian family segregating congenital profound ARNSHL. Mutation screening of DFNB31/WHRNrevealed four nonpathogenic sequence variants and a novel frameshift mutation [c.2423delG] + [c.2423delG] that changed the reading frame and induced a novel stop codon at amino acid 818 ([p.Gly808AspfsX11] + [p.Gly808AspfsX11]). To determine the contribution of the DFNB31locus in the childhood deafness, we performed linkage analysis in 62 unrelated informative families affected with ARNSHL. No linkage was found to this locus. From this study, we concluded that DFNB31/WHRN is most likely to be a rare cause of ARNSHL in the Tunisian population.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
17066295,Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness locus DFNB63 at chromosome 11q13.2-q13.3.,"A genome wide linkage analysis of nonsyndromic deafness segregating in a consanguineous Pakistani family (PKDF537) was used to identify DFNB63, a new locus for congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss. A maximum two-point lod score of 6.98 at theta = 0 was obtained for marker D11S1337 (68.55 cM). Genotyping of 550 families revealed three additional families (PKDF295, PKDF702 and PKDF817) segregating hearing loss linked to chromosome 11q13.2-q13.3. Meiotic recombination events in these four families define a critical interval of 4.81 cM bounded by markers D11S4113 (68.01 cM) and D11S4162 (72.82 cM), and SHANK2, FGF-3, TPCN2 and CTTN are among the candidate genes in this interval. Positional identification of this deafness gene should reveal a protein necessary for normal development and/or function of the auditory system.","research support, n.i.h., intramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
14982824,Central microtubular agenesis causing primary ciliary dyskinesia.,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chronic upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms. We report the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with a circular ciliary beat pattern in three siblings. This beat pattern is consistent with a ciliary transposition defect, where a peripheral microtubule doublet is transposed to the center of the ciliary axoneme to replace the absent central microtubule pair. However, in these siblings, ultrastructural analysis of the cilia revealed an absence of the central microtubule pair only. This variant of transposition with a circular ciliary beat pattern has not been described previously. In addition, this defect, together with the transposition defect, may help explain the mechanism of the circular beat pattern and also the absence of situs inversus in these patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article; case reports"
27694521,Mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan C (PIGC) gene are associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability.,"Of our 1400 exome-studied patients, 67% originate from consanguineous families. ∼80% suffer from variable degree of intellectual disability (ID). The search for disease causing genes using homozygosity mapping was progressing slowly until 2010, then markedly accelerated by the introduction of exome analysis.To identify the disease causing mutation(s) in three patients from two unrelated families who suffered from global developmental delay, severe ID and drug-responsive seizure disorder.Exome analysis was performed in DNA of the three patients. The identified PIGC variants were generated and transfected into PIGC-defective mouse cells and the restoration of the surface expression of mouse CD90, CD48 and FLAER was assessed using flow cytometry. The expression of these proteins was also studied on the surface of patients' leucocytes.Three PIGC mutations were identified; homozygous p.L189W in one family and compound heterozygosity for p.L212P/p.R21X variants in another. PIGC participates in the biosynthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor which tethers proteins to plasma membrane. In cells lacking PIGC protein, which were transfected with each of the PIGC variants, we detected a clear reduction of surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins. Furthermore, analyses of patients' leucocytes showed significant and constant decrease of CD16 surface expression in granulocytes, and moderate decrease of CD14, CD55, CD59 and FLAER levels.PIGC joins the list of genes in which mutations result in defective biosynthesis of GPI anchoring, manifesting by global developmental delay and seizure disorder. The lack of specific biomarker dictates exome sequencing as the diagnostic procedure of choice in similar patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; journal article"
29048736,Novel recessive PDZD7 biallelic mutations in two Chinese families with non-syndromic hearing loss.,"Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is a highly heterogeneous genetic condition. PDZD7 has emerged as a new genetic etiology of ARNSHL. Biallelic mutations in the PDZD7 gene have been reported in two German families, four Iranian families, and a Pakistani family with ARNSHL. The effect of PDZD7 on ARNSHL in other population has yet to be elucidated. Two Chinese ARNSHL families, each of which had two affected siblings, were included in this study. The families underwent target region capture and high-throughput sequencing to analyze the exonic, splice-site, and intronic sequences of 128 genes. Furthermore, 1751 normal Chinese individuals served as controls, and 122 Chinese families segregating with apparent ARNSHL, who had been previously excluded for variants in the common deafness genes GJB2 and SLC26A4, were subjected to screening for candidate mutations. We identified a novel homozygous missense mutation (p.Arg66Leu) and novel compound heterozygous frameshift mutations (p.Arg56fsTer24 and p.His403fsTer36) in Chinese families with ARNSHL. This is the first report to identify PDZD7 as an ARNSHL-associated gene in the Chinese population. Our finding could expand the pathogenic spectrum and strengthens the clinical diagnostic role of the PDZD7 gene in ARNSHL patients.","research support, non-u.s. gov't; research-article; journal article; case reports"
