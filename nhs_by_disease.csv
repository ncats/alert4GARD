The presentation was refractory to standard medical treatment such that treatment required radical subgaleal excision of the entire hair-bearing scalp. Reconstruction was in the form of split-thickness skin grafting at the level of the pericranium following several days of vacuum-assisted closure dressing to promote an acceptable wound bed for skin grafting and to ensure appropriate clearance of infection. Numerous nonsurgical modalities have been described for the treatment of dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, with surgical intervention reserved for patients refractory to medical treatment. The present paper reports a fulminant form of the disease in an atypical age of presentation, adolescence. The pathophysiology, etiology, natural history, complications and treatment options for dissecting cellulitis of the scalp are reviewed, and the authors suggest this method of treatment to be efficacious for severe presentations refractory to medical therapy."

The understanding of primary lymphoedema has been impeded by confusing terminology and a tendency to simply divide patients into three categories based on the age of onset: lymphoedema congenita manifests at or shortly after birth, lymphoedema praecox is apparent before the age of 35 years and lymphoedema tarda manifests thereafter. The clinical presentation in the spectrum of primary lymphoedema disorders is very variable; the phenotypes of primary lymphoedema conditions vary in the age of onset, site of the oedema, inheritance patterns, associated features and genetic causes. Different inheritance patterns are recognised and there are numerous associated anomalies. Some subgroups, such as Milroy disease and Lymphoedema distichiasis, are well characterised, but others are not. A new clinical classification for primary lymphoedema has been developed as a diagnostic algorithm. Its use is demonstrated on 333 probands referred to our lymphoedema clinic. Grouping patients by accurate phenotyping facilitates molecular investigations, understanding of inheritance patterns, and the natural history of different types of primary lymphoedema. Descriptions of the diagnostic categories, some of which have not been previously clearly defined as distinct clinical entities, are illustrated by clinical cases."

These catchments belong to five previously studied catchment systems and one new catchment system (Tonlesap) in the Lower Mekong Basin. Two new catchment systems, Prachin Buri and Bang Pakong from eastern and central Thailand, respectively, were also examined. We collected 289 specimens of B. s. goniomphalos from 15 previously studied localities and 18 new localities in Thailand, Lao PDR (People's Democratic Republic), and Cambodia. The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 and 16S ribosomal DNA sequences were used to determine genetic variation. Classification of haplotypes specified 100 at the cox1 locus and 15 at the rrnL locus. Comparison between 16 catchment populations found significant genetic differences (ФST) between all populations. The phylogenetic tree and haplotype network analyses classified B. s. goniomphalos into three evolutionary lineages (lineage I-III). Lineage I contained B. s. goniomphalos from the Mekong, Chi, Mun, Prachin Buri and Bang Pakong catchments in Thailand, including the Nam Ngum catchment in Lao PDR. Lineage II contained all specimens from the Tonlesap catchment, whereas lineage III contained specimens from the Mekong and Sea Bang Heang catchments in Thailand and Lao PDR, respectively. Interestingly, Bithynia siamensis siamensis was placed between lineages I and II of B. s. goniomphalos. This study supports the hypothesis that B. s. goniomphalos is a species complex containing at least three distinct evolutionary lineages in the Lower Mekong Basin, and that comprehensive molecular genetic analyses need to be conducted to further our understanding of the evolutionary and systematic relationships of these Bithynia snail taxa."

Damming of the Senegal River for irrigation purposes in the 1980s induced ecological changes that resulted in a large outbreak of Schistosoma mansoni, followed a few years later by an increase and spread of Schistosoma haematobium infections. The presence of hybrid crosses between the human and cattle schistosomes, S. haematobium and Schistosoma bovis, respectively, is adding complexity to the disease epidemiology in this area, and questions the strength of the species boundary between these two species. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of S. haematobium, S. bovis and their hybrids along the Senegal River basin using both microsatellite genetic markers and analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. Human schistosome populations with a S. haematobium cox1 mtDNA profile and those with a S. bovis cox1 mtDNA profile (the so-called hybrids) appear to belong to a single randomly mating population, strongly differentiated from the pure S. bovis found in cattle. These results suggest that, in northern Senegal, a strong species boundary persists between human and cattle schistosome species and there is no prolific admixing of the populations. In addition, we found that in the SRB S. haematobium was spatially more differentiated in comparison to S. mansoni. This may be related either to the presence and susceptibility of the intermediate snail hosts, or to the colonisation history of the parasite."

Whilst it causes most damage to its primary host, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus), transport and reservoir hosts likely play a key role in maintaining the parasite in the environment. Here, we tested the ability of G. salaris (strain River Lierelva, southern Norway) to infect and reproduce on a population of wild caught alpine bullhead (Cottus poecilopus Heckel). Exposure of alpine bullhead yearlings (0+) to G. salaris for 24 h at low (6.5 °C) or high temperature (11.5 °C) resulted in the establishment of 1 to 104 parasites per fish. Eight to nine days post-infection at high temperature, the infection of G. salaris was eliminated, indicative of innate host immunity. In contrast, at low temperature G. salaris infections persisted for 47-48 days. The relative lengthy infection of alpine bullhead with G. salaris compared to other non-salmonids tested may be due to low temperature and high initial infection load in combination with an epibiont infection. The present results suggest that this non-salmonid may function as a temperature-dependent transport or reservoir host for G. salaris."

The fish were collected during the cool-dry (November-February), hot-dry (March-May), and rainy (June-October) seasons in 2017. They were examined by the digestion method, and the infection status was statistically analyzed by study area, season, and fish size. The prevalence (no. of fish positive/no. of fish examined × 100) and metacercarial intensities (no. of metacercariae detected/no. of fish positive) of O. viverrini in both study areas depended on season, being high in the cool-dry season and varying in the hot-dry and rainy seasons. In Mukdahan Province, the average prevalence was 18.3% (range 11.0-46.7%, n = 420) and the intensity was 4.07 ± 5.86 cysts/fish (mean ± SD), whereas in Khammouane Province, the prevalence was 51.9% (range 9.1-70.6%, n = 673) and the intensity was 6.67 ± 12.88 cysts/fish. Among the cyprinid fish species examined, the infection was associated with fish body size and predominantly found in Hampala dispar (86.5%), Cyclocheilichthys armatus (73.2%), and Puntius brevis (42.7%). The distribution of O. viverrini metacercariae in fish was skewed, with most of the fish having a low worm burden with an average of four to six cysts/fish. The findings that seasonality, sampling locality, fish size, and species of fish play roles in the risk of O. viverrini infection imply that these host and environmental factors are important for the transmission dynamics and control of O. viverrini."

In this series we present the most comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic characterization of SAS to date, including prevalence of each clinical feature, neurodevelopmental milestones, and when available, patient management. We confirm that the most distinctive features are neurodevelopmental delay with invariably severely limited speech, abnormalities of the palate (cleft or high-arched), dental anomalies (crowding, macrodontia, abnormal shape), and behavioral issues with or without bone or brain anomalies. This comprehensive clinical characterization will help clinicians with the diagnosis, counseling and management of SAS and help provide families with anticipatory guidance."

In its most typical form it is characterized by the presence of hypertelorism, bifid uvula/cleft palate and aortic aneurysm and/or arterial tortuosity. LDS is caused by heterozygous loss of function mutations in the genes encoding TGFβ receptor 1 and 2 (TGFBR1 and -2), which lead to a paradoxical increase in TGFβ signaling. To address this apparent paradox and to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of aneurysmal disease, we characterized a new Tgfbr1 mouse model carrying a p.Y378* nonsense mutation. Study of the natural history in this model showed that homozygous mutant mice die during embryonic development due to defective vascularization. Heterozygous mutant mice aged 6 and 12 months were morphologically and (immuno)histochemically indistinguishable from wild-type mice. We show that the mutant allele is degraded by nonsense mediated mRNA decay, expected to result in haploinsufficiency of the mutant allele. Since this haploinsufficiency model does not result in cardiovascular malformations, it does not allow further study of the process of aneurysm formation. In addition to providing a comprehensive method for cardiovascular phenotyping in mice, the results of this study confirm that haploinsuffciency is not the underlying genetic mechanism in human LDS."

We review the increasing evidence implicating COL2A1 mutations in individuals presenting with isolated degenerative joint disease, aiming to alert physicians who assess these patients to this possibility. The importance of finding a COL2A1 mutation in such patients lies in the subsequent ability to accurately assess recurrence risks, offer early (including prenatal) diagnosis, and provide information regarding the natural history of the condition.

The disease is characterized by the triad of arterial tortuosity and aneurysms, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula or cleft palate and is caused by heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding transforming growth factor beta receptors 1 and 2 (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, respectively). METHODS: We undertook the clinical and molecular characterization of 52 affected families. Forty probands presented with typical manifestations of the Loeys-Dietz syndrome. In view of the phenotypic overlap between this syndrome and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, we screened an additional cohort of 40 patients who had vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome without the characteristic type III collagen abnormalities or the craniofacial features of the Loeys-Dietz syndrome. RESULTS: We found a mutation in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 in all probands with typical Loeys-Dietz syndrome (type I) and in 12 probands presenting with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Loeys-Dietz syndrome type II). The natural history of both types was characterized by aggressive arterial aneurysms (mean age at death, 26.0 years) and a high incidence of pregnancy-related complications (in 6 of 12 women). Patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type I, as compared with those with type II, underwent cardiovascular surgery earlier (mean age, 16.9 years vs. 26.9 years) and died earlier (22.6 years vs. 31.8 years). There were 59 vascular surgeries in the cohort, with one death during the procedure. This low rate of intraoperative mortality distinguishes the Loeys-Dietz syndrome from vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in either TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 predispose patients to aggressive and widespread vascular disease. The severity of the clinical presentation is predictive of the outcome. Genotyping of patients presenting with symptoms like those of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may be used to guide therapy, including the use and timing of prophylactic vascular surgery."

In this patient, the septal aneurysm produced both favorable and unfavorable hemodynamic effects. A reduction in the size of the ventricular septal defect produced a favorable effect, whereas a right ventricular outflow obstruction led to the unfavorable situation of right ventricular hypertension and hypertrophy. The large septal aneurysm in the presence of an already compromised right ventricular outflow tract related to an anteriorly malaligned septum resulted in severe obstruction."

The clinical features of DCRV, especially in the pediatric population, have not been sufficiently elaborated. There are many unanswered questions regarding the surgical indications, surgical timing, natural history, and patient outcomes. This article will discuss the definition, pathophysiology, clinical features and treatment of DCRV. This systematic review showed a higher prevalence of symptomatic patients among children with DCRV with signs of right ventricular pressure overload and associated congenital heart defects. The spatial relation between ventricular septal defect and the anomalous muscle bundle might be a determinant of right ventricular obstruction. Symptomatic patients with an intra-right ventricular pressure gradient of >20 mmHg are indicated for a surgical repair. DCRV has a favourable postoperative course as no postoperative death was reported. Mechanisms of right ventricular obstruction warrant further elucidations based on larger patient population in the near future."

The surprising outcome of the study was that both active botulinum toxin treatment and sham treatment resulted in a significant reduction in symptoms and manometric abnormalities after 3 months, with no difference between the two arms. One can interpret the lack of effect of botulinum toxin over placebo as indicative of the benign natural history of hypercontractile esophageal motility disorders or be convinced that many patients with hypercontractility on manometry actually have functional symptoms not related to the manometric findings, and thus, treatment of hypercontractility is not more effective than placebo.

METHODS:A retrospective observational database study was conducted, reviewing the medical charts of 69 adult survivors with a history of a vascular ring, identified from the Dutch Congenital Cor vitia database. RESULTS:Median age at presentation was 8.5 years (0-53.0 years). Thirty patients (43.5%) had a ""left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery,"" 21 patients (30.4%) a ""double aortic arch,"" and 16 patients (23.2%) a ""right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery."" The main symptomatology at presentation comprised respiratory symptoms (82.9%). Almost three-quarters of patients were also diagnosed with asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity. Patients with a double aortic arch had more symptoms than patients with a left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery and right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery (P < 0.001), requiring surgery most often (P < 0.001). In patients with childhood onset of symptoms, preoperative spirometry (ie, peak expiratory flows) was more often abnormal as compared with adult patients (P = 0.007). Surgery was performed in 42.0% of all patients at a median age of 17 years (0-63.0 years). Twenty-four (92.3%) of the operated patients showed improvement or complete relief of symptoms shortly after surgery. Of 26 asymptomatic nonoperated patients, 3 patients (11.5%) eventually developed symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:The low incidence of vascular rings, their anatomic heterogeneity, and a wide range of common symptoms often lead to misdiagnosis. Clinical awareness is warranted as a large subset of patients could benefit from surgery, even at an adult age."

Clinical recognition can be challenging, so echocardiography is often the means by which definitive diagnosis is made. The tricuspid valve and right ventricle are on the systemic arterial side of the ccTGA circulation, and are therefore subject to progressive functional deterioration. The natural history of ccTGA is also greatly influenced by the nature and severity of accompanying lesions, some of which require surgical repair. Some management strategies leave the right ventricle as the systemic arterial pump, but carry the risk of worsening heart failure. More complex 'double switch' repairs establish the left ventricle as the systemic pump, and include an atrial baffle to redirect venous return in combination with either arterial switch or Rastelli operation (if a suitable ventricular septal defect permits). Occasionally, the anatomic peculiarities of ccTGA do not allow straightforward biventricular repair, and Fontan palliation is a reasonable option. Regardless of the approach selected, late cardiovascular complications are relatively common, so ongoing outpatient surveillance should be established in an age-appropriate facility with expertise in congenital heart disease care."

We conducted this systematic review based on the current epidemiology knowledge of GRDs, focusing on the changing prevalence of GRDs reported in the Asia-Pacific region. METHODS:We searched Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane database with the following MeSH terms and keywords: celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA), non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and gluten ataxia (GA) and the prevalence studies published from January 1991 to January 2018. Each article was cross-referenced with ""Asia-Pacific region"" and countries in this region such as Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran and others. RESULTS:We included 66 studies, which reported the prevalence of GRDs in the Asia-Pacific region. Prevalence of celiac disease was 0.32%-1.41% in healthy children and 0.05%-1.22% in the adult population, while the prevalence in the high risk population was higher (0.6%-11.8%). Previous studies have shown a very low incidence of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) (<0.001%) and gluten ataxia (GA) in this area. Few studies on NCGS outbreaks have been found in this area due to the lack of specific diagnostic biomarkers. Wheat allergy (WA), although uncommon in most Asian-Pacific countries, is the most common cause of anaphylaxis in this region. CONCLUSION:The results of this systematic review suggest the need to plan further proper epidemiological studies in order to understand the natural history of GRDs and to assess its burden on health systems."

We utilize research on dermatitis herpetiformis, which is a model disease in which a gluten-induced entity erupts in the skin irrespective of the state of the small intestinal mucosal morphology. Furthermore, gluten ataxia can be categorized as its own entity. The other extra-intestinal manifestations occurring in celiac disease are also found at the latent disease stage. Consequently, patients with celiac traits should be identified and treated."

Undiagnosed cases were identified through sequential serology, and unaffected age- and gender-matched controls were selected. Medical records were systematically reviewed for indications for and evidence of clinical testing. RESULTS:Of 47 557 adults, 408 cases of undiagnosed coeliac disease were identified. 408 serology negative matched controls were selected. Eight-matched pairs were excluded, leading to 800 included individuals (61% female; median age 44.2 years). The odds of any indication for clinical testing were similar among undiagnosed coeliac disease and controls (odds ratio (OR) 1.18; 95% CI: 0.85-1.63, P = 0.32). Most individual indications were not associated with serologic status. Exceptions to this include hypothyroidism, which was more likely in cases of undiagnosed coeliac disease, and dyspepsia and chronic diarrhoea, which were less likely.

Ultimate, fitness-based explanations for these deviations in animals typically focus on community-level or physiological processes (e.g., competition, thermoregulation). However, proximate mechanisms underlying adaptive body size adjustments remain poorly understood. Adjustments in adult body size may result from shifts in growth-related life-history traits, such as the length of time to achieve adult body size (i.e., growth period) and how quickly the body increases in size (i.e., growth rate). Since insular populations often demonstrate dramatic shifts in adult body size, island populations represent a natural experiment by which to test the proximate mechanisms of size change. Here, using dental eruption patterns, we show that a dwarfed population of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) experiences significant heterochronic shifts relative to mainland conspecifics. Namely, juvenile development slowed, such that teeth erupted ≥ 1 year later, but cranial growth suggested no concurrent adjustments in skeletal growth period. Thus, slowed growth rate, shown here with teeth, combined with unchanged growth period resulted in dwarfism, consistent with ultimate predictions for insular, resource-limited populations. Therefore, selection on body size may act on life-history traits that influence body size, rather than acting on body size directly."

OBJECTIVE:To report the natural history of spinopelvic parameters in achondroplasia. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Sagittal spinal deformity is common in children with achondroplasia. However, few data exist on their normative spinal parameters. METHODS:Lateral standing spine radiographs of children with achondroplasia were reviewed. Measurements included thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis (LL), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), pelvic incidence (PI), T1 pelvic angle (TPA), and sagittal balance (SVA). Comparison between age groups and longitudinal analysis of children with minimum five-year radiographic evaluation was performed; evolution of radiographic measurements was assessed. Children who underwent surgical correction of TLK were studied separately to describe changes of sagittal spinal parameters associated with TLK surgical correction. RESULTS:In cross-sectional analysis, 745 radiographs (282 children) were measured. During the first three years, TLK decreased and LL and sacral slope increased significantly. After age 3 years, TLK decreased gradually until age 10. Afterwards, TLK decrease became non-significant. PI increased gradually after age 10. In the longitudinal group, 81 children were followed an average of 8.7 (5-19) years between age 4.4 and 13.1 years. TLK decreased; LL and PI increased significantly. TPA and SVA remained within the normal range although changes with growth were statistically significant. In the surgical group, 19 children underwent surgical TLK correction. Apart from TLK correction, no sagittal parameters changed significantly after surgery. These 19 children had higher TLK and lower LL compared with a nonsurgical group at similar average age. CONCLUSION:In children with achondroplasia, TLK improvement occurs primarily before age 3 years; hyperlordosis at the lumbosacral level is the compensatory mechanism. Significant changes in the sagittal spinal parameters occur early in life, suggesting the importance of attention to sagittal malalignment to prevent any possible clinical sequelae of severe hyperlordosis.

Previous muscle imaging studies describe a selective pattern of muscle involvement in smaller patient cohorts, but a large imaging study across the entire spectrum of the dysferlinopathies had not been performed and previous imaging findings were not correlated with functional tests. METHODS:We present cross-sectional T1-weighted muscle MRI data from 182 patients with genetically confirmed dysferlinopathies. We have analysed the pattern of muscles involved in the disease using hierarchical analysis and presented it as heatmaps. Results of the MRI scans have been correlated with relevant functional tests for each region of the body analysed. RESULTS:In 181 of the 182 patients scanned, we observed muscle pathology on T1-weighted images, with the gastrocnemius medialis and the soleus being the most commonly affected muscles. A similar pattern of involvement was identified in most patients regardless of their clinical presentation. Increased muscle pathology on MRI correlated positively with disease duration and functional impairment. CONCLUSIONS:The information generated by this study is of high diagnostic value and important for clinical trial development. We have been able to describe a pattern that can be considered as characteristic of dysferlinopathy. We have defined the natural history of the disease from a radiological point of view.

The diagnosis is usually based on discrepancies between fibrinogen activity and antigen levels, but could require more specialized techniques for the assessment of fibrinogen function, owing to some limitations in routine assays. Molecular abnormalities, which are frequently heterozygous missense mutations localized in exon 2 of FGA and exon 8 of FGG, lead to defects in one or more phases of fibrinogen to fibrin conversion, fibrin network formation, and other important functions of fibrinogen. The clinical phenotype is highly heterogeneous, from no manifestations to bleeding and/or thrombotic events. Asymptomatic propositi and relatives with the predisposing genotype are at risk of developing adverse outcomes during the natural course of the disease. Correlations between genotype and phenotype have not yet been clearly established, with the exception of some abnormal fibrinogens that severely increase the risk of thrombosis. Functional analysis of polymerization and fibrinolysis, structural studies of the fibrin network and the viscoelastic properties of fibrin clot could help to predict the phenotype of congenital dysfibrinogenemia, but have not yet been evaluated in detail. The management is essentially based on personal and family history; however, even individuals who are still asymptomatic and without a family history should be carefully assessed and monitored.

This cast doubts on the of cost effectiveness and clinical significance of assaying hemostasis inhibitors in all such patients. The goal of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of inherited and acquired abnormalities of hemostasis in younger symptomatic outpatients with objectively diagnosed venous thromboembolic disease (VTD). METHODS: From October 1994 to October 1996, we diagnosed, treated and followed 191 consecutive outpatients with an objective diagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease, and assayed natural and acquired hemostasis inhibitors in 81 of them aged less than 50; in addition, 129 relatives of patients with inherited deficiencies were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-six of the patients under age 50 showed inherited deficiencies of natural inhibitors (3 antithrombin, 5 protein C, 3 protein 5 and 14 APC-R, 1 dysfibrinogenemia) and 8 patients had lupus anticoagulant (LA): abnormalities of hemostasis were found in 41.9% (95% confidence interval 31.1-53.5). In older selected patients, 60% (95% confidence interval 40.6-77.3) of the subjects showed abnormalities. Seventy-two of the relatives displayed natural inhibitor deficiencies; 88.5% of the families studied had at least one relative with the same defect as the propositus.

We sought to evaluate characteristics and survival outcomes in men with EGCTs. METHODS:We performed a retrospective analysis on a consecutive list of men diagnosed with EGCT in two Albertan cancer centres between 1990 and 2013. Demographic characteristics and outcomes, stratified by primary site, were evaluated. RESULTS:Sixty-nine cases were identified. The median age was 29 (range 15-76) and 48 cases (70%) were non-seminomatous. Twenty-four (35%) belonged to International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) favourable risk group, 14 (20%) to intermediate, and 31 (45%) to poor. Thirty (43%) had mediastinal primary (MPs); 29 were treated with first-line bleomycin, etopo-side, and cisplatin (BEP). Seventeen (57%) relapses occurred, of which three patients achieved long-term survival. Seventeen (25%) had a central nervous system (CNS) primary, with eight (47%) classic germinoma. Seven (41%) received primary chemotherapy alone; 5 (29%) received primary radiotherapy alone, and 5 (29%) received both. Nineteen (28%) had a retroperitoneal primary (RPs) and received first-line chemotherapy; all but two received BEP and eight (42%) had surgical resection. Three (5%) had other or unknown primary. Five-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival for all patients were 56% and 44%, respectively; for MPs, 44% and 34%; for CNS primary, 76% and 53%; for RPs, 58% and 53%. Factors that correlated with decreased OS were elevated alpha fetoprotein (AFP) (p<0.001) or human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) (p=0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (p=0.028), bone metastasis (p<0.001), lung metastasis (p<0.001), and IGCCCG poor risk (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS:EGCT is a rare, but important subset of GCT. Patients with EGCTs, despite aggressive treatments, still have poorer outcomes than gonadal primary."

The frequency, clinical and radiological presentations, and outcomes were analyzed to investigate the relationship among radiation dose, associated chemotherapy, age, latency and localization of radiation-induced CM. 100 out of 108 children were treated with radiotherapy for primary brain tumor; 34 (27 with medulloblastoma and 7 with other histologies) out of 100 patients developed CM. No significant relationship was found between CM and gender (p = 0.70), age (p = 0.90), use of specific chemotherapy (standard versus high-dose, p = 0.38), methotrexate (p = 0.49), and radiation dose (p = 0.45). However, CM developed more frequently and earlier when radiotherapy was associated with methotrexate (70 % of cases). Radiation-induced CM prevailingly occurred in the cerebral hemispheres (p = 0.0001). Only 3 patients (9 %) were symptomatic with headache. Three patients underwent surgery for intra- or extra-lesional hemorrhage. CM was confirmed by histopathology for all 3 patients. The vast majority of radiation-induced CM is asymptomatic, and macro-hemorrhagic events occur rarely. Concomitant therapy with methotrexate seems to favor their development. We recommend observation for asymptomatic lesions, while surgery should be reserved to symptomatic growth or hemorrhage."

We report a rare case of a pineal region GCT showing rapid enlargement within 2 months, after 7 years with no growth. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A boy presented with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty at 6 years 10 months of age. Although a slight elevation of β-human chorionic gonadotropin suggested that a small pineal cystic lesion observed on magnetic resonance imaging might be an β-human chorionic gonadotropin--producing tumor, it was not clear whether the mass was truly a GCT. Accordingly, we followed up the pineal lesion and serum pituitary gonadotropin levels for approximately 7 years. After this period without essential tumor growth, the pineal tumor suddenly showed rapid enlargement, which prompted treatment. A histopathological investigation revealed a mixed GCT with a germinoma and an immature teratoma. Serum pituitary gonadotropin levels at 5 years after the first examination had increased to normal pubertal ranges. Although the pituitary gonadotropin levels had remained low during the period with no tumor growth, the gonadotropin levels were elevated and had continued to increase at least 2 years before the rapid enlargement of the tumor. CONCLUSION: These phenomena suggest that levels of neuroendocrinological parameters such as pituitary gonadotropin at puberty might affect the enlargement of pineal region GCTs, which might account for the natural history of GCTs, ie, their frequent detection at puberty."

These mutations form a complex spectrum. A national registration network is essential not only to provide more information about the prevalence and natural history of the disease, but also to collect genetic data for analyzing the mutational spectrum. This information is extremely beneficial for basic scientific research, genetic diagnosis, trial planning, clinical care, and gene therapy. METHODS:We collected data from 1400 patients (1042 patients with confirmed unrelated Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD] or Becker muscular dystrophy [BMD]) registered in the Chinese Genetic Disease Registry from March 2012 to August 2017 and analyzed the genetic mutational characteristics of these patients. RESULTS:Large deletions were the most frequent type of mutation (72.2%), followed by nonsense mutations (11.9%), exon duplications (8.8%), small deletions (3.0%), splice-site mutations (2.1%), small insertions (1.3%), missense mutations (0.6%), and a combination mutation of a deletion and a duplication (0.1%). Exon 45-50 deletion was the most frequent deletion type, while exon 2 duplication was the most common duplication type. Two deletion hotspots were calculated-one located toward the central part (exon 45-52) of the gene and the other toward the 5'end (exon 8-26). We found no significant difference between hereditary and de novo mutations on deletion hotspots. Nonsense mutations accounted for 62.9% of all small mutations (197 patients). CONCLUSION:We built a comprehensive national dystrophinopathy mutation database in China, which is essential for basic and clinical research in this field. The mutational spectrum and characteristics of this DMD/BMD group were largely consistent with those in previous international DMD/BMD studies, with some differences. Based on our results, about 12% of DMD/BMD patients with nonsense mutations may benefit from stop codon read-through therapy. Additionally, the top three targets for exon-skipping therapy are exon 51 (141, 13.5%), exon 53 (115, 11.0%), and exon 45 (84, 8.0%)."

OBJECTIVES:The present study used data from Remudy, a national registry for neuromuscular diseases in Japan, to conduct a phenotypic analysis of BMD. METHODS:We analyzed Remudy data of participants with dystrophinopathy. All participants who were aged 17 and older and were ambulant at age 13 were included in this study. Participants were divided into two groups: those with BMD who were ambulant at age 17, and those with intermediate muscular dystrophy (IMD) who lost ambulation by age 17. Frequent mutations were analyzed by age at ambulation, cardiopulmonary function, and genotype. For clinical comparisons, participants who were administered steroids were excluded. RESULTS:From July 2009 through September 2015, 192 participants had registered with Remudy. Mean participant age was 34.80±13.3 (range, 17-78) years, and 52.1% of participants were ambulant.

This suggests the existence of trans-acting variants in modifier genes. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes (SPP1, encoding osteopontin, and LTBP4, encoding latent transforming growth factor β [TGFβ]-binding protein 4) have been established as DMD modifiers. We performed a genome-wide association study of age at LoA in a sub-cohort of European or European American ancestry (n = 109) from the Cooperative International Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study (CINRG-DNHS). We focused on protein-altering variants (Exome Chip) and included glucocorticoid treatment as a covariate. As expected, due to the small population size, no SNPs displayed an exome-wide significant p value (< 1.8 × 10-6). Subsequently, we prioritized 438 SNPs in the vicinities of 384 genes implicated in DMD-related pathways, i.e., the nuclear-factor-κB and TGFβ pathways. The minor allele at rs1883832, in the 5'-untranslated region of CD40, was associated with earlier LoA (p = 3.5 × 10-5). This allele diminishes the expression of CD40, a co-stimulatory molecule for T cell polarization. We validated this association in multiple independent DMD cohorts (United Dystrophinopathy Project, Bio-NMD, and Padova, total n = 660), establishing this locus as a DMD modifier. This finding points to cell-mediated immunity as a relevant pathogenetic mechanism and potential therapeutic target in DMD."

While a number of international treaties call for the implementation of EAF, there are still gaps in the underlying methodology. One aspect that has received substantial scientific attention recently is fisheries-induced evolution (FIE). Increasing evidence indicates that intensive fishing has the potential to exert strong directional selection on life-history traits, behaviour, physiology, and morphology of exploited fish. Of particular concern is that reversing evolutionary responses to fishing can be much more difficult than reversing demographic or phenotypically plastic responses. Furthermore, like climate change, multiple agents cause FIE, with effects accumulating over time. Consequently, FIE may alter the utility derived from fish stocks, which in turn can modify the monetary value living aquatic resources provide to society. Quantifying and predicting the evolutionary effects of fishing is therefore important for both ecological and economic reasons. An important reason this is not happening is the lack of an appropriate assessment framework. We therefore describe the evolutionary impact assessment (EvoIA) as a structured approach for assessing the evolutionary consequences of fishing and evaluating the predicted evolutionary outcomes of alternative management options. EvoIA can contribute to EAF by clarifying how evolution may alter stock properties and ecological relations, support the precautionary approach to fisheries management by addressing a previously overlooked source of uncertainty and risk, and thus contribute to sustainable fisheries."

Up to 104 phytophagous species have been reported causing damage to leaves, buds and fruits, but only a dozen can be considered major pests requiring control measures. In recent years, several species have expanded their geographical range primarily due to the great increase in trade and travel worldwide, representing a threat to agriculture in many countries. Three spider mite species (Acari: Tetranychidae) have recently invaded the citrus-growing areas in the Mediterranean region and Latin America. The Oriental red mite, Eutetranychus orientalis (Klein), presumably from the Near East, was detected in southern Spain in 2001. The Texas citrus mite, Eutetranychus banksi (McGregor), is widely distributed in North, Central and South America. It was first reported in Europe in 1999 on citrus in Portugal; afterwards the mite invaded the citrus orchards in southern Spain. In Latin America, the Hindustan citrus mite, Schizotetranychus hindustanicus (Hirst), previously known only from citrus and other host plants in India, was reported causing significant damage to citrus leaves and fruits in Zulia, northwest Venezuela, in the late 1990s. Later, this mite species spread to the southeast being detected on lemon trees in the state of Roraima in northern Brazil in 2008. Whereas damage levels, population dynamics and control measures are relatively well know in the case of Oriental red mite and Texas citrus mite, our knowledge of S. hindustanicus is noticeably scant. In the present paper, information on pest status, seasonal trends and natural enemies in invaded areas is provided for these species, together with morphological data useful for identification. Because invasive species may evolve during the invasion process, comparison of behavior, damage and management options between native and invaded areas for these species will be useful for understanding the invader's success and their ability to colonize new regions."

The agent is an enveloped RNA virus with a non-segmented single-stranded negative-sense genome. The viral genome encodes 8 structural and 2 non-structural proteins. Important structural proteins include the fusion (F) protein and the attachment (G) protein which are essential for viral penetration and attachment to the host cells. Both proteins are important in development of immune responses. The virus is estimated to cause 3000 to 4000 deaths annually. Primary infections are as a rule symptomatic. The spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from mild upper tract illness, infection in middle ear which progresses to acute otitis media, croup, to apnoea in premature infants, pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Premature babies born at 30-35 weeks of gestation, infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease, HIV-infected subjects, and patients on intensive immunosuppressive therapy especially after bone marrow transplant are considered to be at risk for increased mortality and morbidity during RSV infection. The virus does not normally replicate outside of the bronchopulmonary tree and the infection is exquisitely restricted to the respiratory mucosa. However, development of extrapulmonary disease has been observed in certain T and B cell immunodeficiency states. The association of RSV with asthma and reversible reactive airway disease in early childhood has attracted significant attention. Recurrent wheezing for up to 5 to 7 years of age and established airway disease has been observed in a significant number of children with a strong family history of allergy, after primary infection or reinfection with RSV. Immune response to primary infection is relatively small but on reinfection, a significant booster effect with sustained immunologic reactivity is observed in serum and respiratory mucosa. Both CD(4)- and CD(8)-specific as well as Th(1)- and Th(2)-cell specific immune responses have been observed during human infection. In addition, proinflammatory as well as immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines are induced in the respiratory tract after natural and induced (in vitro) infection. Significant progress has been made in understanding the role of Th(1) vs. Th(2), IgE, viral induced cytokines and chemokines in the mechanisms of pathogenesis of the disease, development of wheezing and in the prevention and treatment of the infection and its sequelae. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the commonest human viral infections, and virtually every child is infected by the third birthday. Because of its restricted mucosal immunopathology, and frequent association with bronchial hyperreactivity and development of wheezing, RSV has served as an important model to investigate mechanisms of mucosal immune responses and development of mucosal disease following infection. The importance of RSV in bronchopulmonary disease and development of bronchial hyperreactivity has been the focus of several recent symposia [Kimpen JL, Simoes EAF. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2001; 163:S1-S6]. This brief report will only summarise, based on selected references, the historical landmarks of its discovery and current understanding of the mechanisms of immunity, and their possible role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary disease."

The number of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase-positive (GGT+) EAF resulting from PH/DEN followed by PB (0.05%) administration for 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months or 4 months did not significantly change when the administration of the promoting agent was followed by a 6-month period of a diet containing no PB. These data demonstrate the stability of the foci induced by the PH/DEN/PB regimen and indicate that the increased number of foci resulting from PB promotion in the absence of overt hepatic necrosis are not reversible on removal of the promoting stimulus. Chronic administration of dose levels of PB below 0.001% in the diet failed to demonstrate an increase in the number of EAF over the number in the control animals not promoted with PB. A linear increase in the number of EAF was observed when rats were chronically fed doses of PB ranging between 0.001% and 0.05% in the diet, whereas diet concentrations of PB greater than 0.05% did not result in any further increase in the number of EAF. The number of EAF resulting from PH/DEN followed by 0.05% PB in the diet increased during the first 3-4 months of promotion. Thereafter, the number of foci did not change despite the continued administration of PB for as long as 8 months. These data suggest the presence of an apparent threshold (no effect level) for promotion by PB and demonstrate the presence of a maximal response of EAF to this promoting agent after initiation by a single dose of DEN."

Among these, there is a long history of infectious diseases that have spread from non-human primates (NHP) to humans. For millennia, indigenous groups that depend on wildlife for their survival were exposed to the risk of NHP pathogens' transmission through animal hunting and wild meat consumption. Usually, exposure is of no consequence or is limited to mild infections. In rare situations, it can be more severe or even become a real public health concern. Since the emergence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), nobody can ignore that an emerging infectious diseases (EID) might spread from NHP into the human population. In large parts of Central Africa and Asia, wildlife remains the primary source of meat and income for millions of people living in rural areas. However, in the past few decades the risk of exposure to an NHP pathogen has taken on a new dimension. Unprecedented breaking down of natural barriers between NHP and humans has increased exposure to health risks for a much larger population, including people living in urban areas. There are several reasons for this: (i) due to road development and massive destruction of ecosystems for agricultural needs, wildlife and humans come into contact more frequently; (ii) due to ecological awareness, many long distance travelers are in search of wildlife discovery, with a particular fascination for African great apes; (iii) due to the attraction for ancient temples and mystical practices, others travelers visit Asian places colonized by NHP. In each case, there is a risk of pathogen transmission through a bite or another route of infection. Beside the individual risk of contracting a pathogen, there is also the possibility of starting a new pandemic. This article reviews the known cases of NHP pathogens' transmission to humans whether they are hunters, travelers, ecotourists, veterinarians, or scientists working on NHP. Although pathogen transmission is supposed to be a rare outcome, Rabies virus, Herpes B virus, Monkeypox virus, Ebola virus, or Yellow fever virus infections are of greater concern and require quick countermeasures from public health professionals."

This is important as at the time of writing this manuscript there is an ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo which has killed over 1000. METHODS:We have evaluated a small number of natural products, some of which had shown antiviral activity against other pathogens. This is exemplified with eugenol, which is found in high concentrations in multiple essential oils, and has shown antiviral activity against feline calicivirus, tomato yellow leaf curl virus, Influenza A virus, Herpes Simplex virus type 1 and 2, and four airborne phages. RESULTS:Four compounds possessed EC50 values less than or equal to 11 μM. Of these, eugenol, had an EC50 of 1.3 μM against EBOV and is present in several plants including clove, cinnamon, basil and bay. Eugenol is much smaller and structurally unlike any compound that has been previously identified as an inhibitor of EBOV, therefore it may provide new mechanistic insights. CONCLUSION:This compound is readily accessible in bulk quantities, is inexpensive, and has a long history of human consumption, which endorses the idea for further assessment as an antiviral therapeutic. This work also suggests that a more exhaustive assessment of natural product libraries against EBOV and other viruses is warranted to improve our ability to identify compounds that are so distinct from FDA approved drugs."

Clarifying the influence of other prevalent diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) will help improve treatment and supportive care of patients with EVD. CASE PRESENTATION:We examined HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody prevalence among suspected EVD cases from the Sierra Leone-China Friendship Biological Safety Laboratory during the epidemic in Sierra Leone. HIV and HCV antibodies were tested in 678 EVD-negative samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A high HIV prevalence (17.6%) and low HCV prevalence (0.22%) were observed among the suspected cases. Notably, we found decreased HIV positive rates among the suspected cases over the course of the epidemic. This suggests a potentially beneficial effect of an improved public health system after assistance from the World Health Organization and other international aid organizations. CONCLUSIONS:This EVD epidemic had a considerable impact on the public health system and influenced the prevalence of HIV found among suspected cases in Sierra Leone, but also provided an opportunity to establish a better surveillance network for infectious diseases."

They are a major public health problem and cause a great impact on economy. Zoonotic outbreaks began to be characterized in the 90s, after the creation of Europol and the FBI. Such investigations are carried by forensic pathologists and other specialists to determine whether an outbreak is natural or deliberate. This review will discuss ten zoonotic outbreaks nonrelated to wars focusing on forensic management. In conclusion, some points should be highlighted in the management of a zoonotic outbreak: (i) its diagnosis and detection by forensic pathologists and the coordination of efforts between other specialists are key factors; (ii) communication guidelines and an efficient healthcare system are crucial for any emergency response; (iii) biosafety of all specialists involved must be guaranteed."

Despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. The alternative hypotheses of a non-bat maintenance host or a maintenance community including, or not, several bat and other species, deserves more investigation. However, African forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. How does one puzzle out? Since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. Under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses. In contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts, our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats, and that the alternative maintenance host, if it exists, must be amongst them. A list of these pathways is provided, along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses. In conclusion, taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses. Understanding the natural history of ebolaviruses is a health priority, and investigating these alternative hypotheses could complete the current effort focused on the role of bats."

Heterozygous C-terminal mutations in NFKB2 have been associated with early-onset common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), central adrenal insufficiency and ectodermal dysplasia. Only two previously reported cases have documented decreased natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, and little is known about the role of NF-κB2 in NK cell maturation and function. Here we report a 13-year-old female that presented at 6 years of age with a history of early onset recurrent sinopulmonary infections, progressive hair loss, and hypogamaglobulinemia consistent with a clinical diagnosis of CVID. At 9 years of age she had cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia that responded to ganciclovir treatment. Functional NK cell testing demonstrated decreased NK cell cytotoxicity despite normal NK cell numbers, consistent with a greater susceptibility to systemic CMV infection. Research exome sequencing (ES) was performed and revealed a novel de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in NFKB2 (c.2611C>T, p.Gln871*) that was not carried by either of her parents. The variant was Sanger sequenced and confirmed to be de novo in the patient. At age 12, she presented with a reactivation of the systemic CMV infection that was associated with severe and progressive nephrotic syndrome with histologic evidence of pedicellar effacement and negative immunofluorescence. To our knowledge, this is the third NF-κB2 deficient patient in which an abnormal NK cell function has been observed, suggesting a role for non-canonical NF-κB2 signaling in NK cell cytotoxicity. NK cell function should be assessed in patients with mutations in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway to explore the risk for systemic viral infections that may lead to severe complications and impact patient survival. Similarly NF-κB2 should be considered in patients with combined immunodeficiency who have aberrant NK cell function. Further studies are needed to characterize the role of NF-κB2 in NK cell cytotoxic function."

We aim to describe the natural history of PHACE to enhance clinical management and counseling of patients. METHODS:A cohort of patients ≥ 18 years was identified through the PHACE Syndrome Registry and a Vascular Anomalies Clinic Database. A cross-sectional survey was designed after a review of the literature by PHACE experts (IF, JP, DS). Questions were selected by consensus, and the survey was conducted using the Qualtrics platform and via in-person interviews. A 75% response rate was found. RESULTS:Eighteen adults-17 females and one transgender male-completed the survey. Respondents ranged in age from 18 to 59, with 24 being the mean age. Eighty-nine percent reported experiencing headaches, and 17% reported experiencing acute but transient symptoms mimicking acute ischemic stroke, later diagnosed as atypical migraines. Thirty-three percent reported hearing loss, and 67% endorsed dental issues. One patient experienced two arterial dissections. Three-fourths who attempted conception were successful, and none of their children had clinical features of PHACE. Because results were based on a retrospective survey, data captured were prone to recall bias and not objective. Results were limited by a small sample size. CONCLUSIONS:Health care providers should be aware of a possible increased risk of neurovascular complications, including atypical migraines mimicking transient ischemic attacks and arterial dissection, in adults with PHACE. Heritability has not been demonstrated, and future studies are needed to assess the risk of infertility."

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions."

METHODS:Recruitment to the PW cohort will take place in antenatal care clinics. PW will be enrolled regardless of symptoms and followed over the course of pregnancy, approximately every 4 weeks. PW will be revisited at delivery (or after miscarriage/abortion) to assess birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities according to the evolving definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). After birth, children will be followed for 2 years in the CH cohort. Follow-up visits are scheduled at ages 1-3, 4-6, 12, and 24 months to assess neurocognitive and developmental milestones. In addition, a NH cohort for the characterization of symptomatic rash/fever illness was designed, including follow-up to capture persisting health problems. Blood, urine, and other biological materials will be collected, and tested for ZIKV and other relevant arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever) using RT-PCR or serological methods. A virtual, decentralized biobank will be created. Reciprocal clinical monitoring has been established between partner sites. Substudies of ZIKV seroprevalence, transmission clustering, disabilities and health economics, viral kinetics, the potential role of antibody enhancement, and co-infections will be linked to the cohort studies. DISCUSSION:Results of these large cohort studies will provide better risk estimates for birth defects and other developmental abnormalities associated with ZIKV infection including possible co-factors for the variability of risk estimates between other countries and regions.

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway.

While adrenarche may be delayed in children with constitutional growth of puberty and in isolated GH deficiency, this does not generally seem to be the case in hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism due to Turner syndrome (TS) and this is (anecdotally) the usual hormonal profile in NS children and adults. Precocious or 'exaggerated' adrenarche can be associated with intrauterine growth retardation and is a forerunner of syndrome X. Although NS neonates often have 'normal' birth weights, in some it can be artificially inflated by subcutaneous edema (as in TS, where intrauterine growth retardation is characteristic). Overall, however, a controlling role for adrenarche (whether precocious or delayed) in gonadarche in NS seems unlikely. Neither normally descended testes nor normal (even if delayed) pubertal development implies normal fertility in NS men. Interactions between fetal, neonatal, childhood and pubertal testis development and gonadal axis maturation are complex. There is probably a spectrum of abnormalities in NS, but most commonly primary gonadal failure and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism - characteristic NS molecular genetic abnormalities - may be important for normal germ cell proliferation, development and migration. The identification of different gene defects facilitates understanding of NS phenotypic diversity and provides opportunities for prospective studies on gonadal and adrenal axes in better defined populations less subject to ascertainment bias. At a clinical level, more longitudinal data are still needed with regard to the natural history of pubertal timing, its tempo of progression and the pattern of pubertal growth."

The natural history of aortic root dilation (AoD), a potential complication of EDS, has not been well characterized in this population. We describe the natural history of aortic root size in a large cohort of patients with hEDS. A cohort of 325 patients with HEDS was identified at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), including 163 patients from a previous study. Medical records were reviewed and each participant's height, weight, and aortic dimensions from up to four echocardiograms were documented. Aortic root z-scores were calculated using two established formulas based on age (Boston or Devereux). Overall prevalence of AoD and prevalence by age were calculated and longitudinal regression was performed. The prevalence of AoD with a z-score ≥ 2.0 was 14.2% (46/325) and with a z-score of ≥3.0 was 5.5% (18/325). No significant increases in z-score were seen over time for patients with multiple echocardiograms. Participants under the age of 15 years had an average decline of 0.1 standard deviations (SDs)/year. No significant change was found after 15 of age. Between the ages of 15 and 21 years, Boston z-scores were 0.96 higher than Devereux z-scores. The nearly 1 z-score unit difference between formulas indicates caution prior to diagnosing AoD in patients with hEDS. In light of the low prevalence and lack of progression of AoD, routine echocardiograms may not be warranted for pediatric patients with hEDS."

Typical signs and symptoms include tachycardia, hypotension, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and disturbed bladder function and sweating regulation. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction may present as Orthostatic Intolerance, Orthostatic Hypotension, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, or Neurally Mediated Hypotension. The incidence, prevalence, and natural history of these conditions remain unquantified, but observations from specialist clinics suggest they are frequently seen in hEDS. There is growing understanding of how hEDS-related physical and physiological pathology contributes to the development of these conditions. Evaluation of cardiovascular symptoms in hEDS should include a careful history and clinical examination. Tests of cardiovascular function range from clinic room observation to tilt-table assessment to other laboratory investigations such as supine and standing catecholamine levels. Non-pharmacologic treatments include education, managing the environment to reduce exposure to triggers, improving cardiovascular fitness, and maintaining hydration. Although there are limited clinical trials, the response to drug treatments in hEDS is supported by evidence from case and cohort observational data, and short-term physiological studies. Pharmacologic therapy is indicated for patients with moderate-severe impairment of daily function and who have inadequate response or tolerance to conservative treatment. Treatment in hEDS often requires a focus on functional maintenance. Also, the negative impact of cardiovascular symptoms on physical and psycho-social well-being may generate a need for a more general evaluation and on-going management and support. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Colonic ruptures are a common feature of the disease, but clear recommendations on their management are lacking. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to identify surgery-related morbidity and 30-day postoperative mortality after colonic perforation. DESIGN:This was a retrospective review. SETTING:A large cohort of patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was followed in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS:Between 2000 and 2016, the French National Reference Centre for Rare Vascular Diseases (HEGP, AP-HP, Paris, France) followed 148 patients with molecularly proven vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:The primary outcomes measured were surgery-related morbidity and 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS:Of 133 patients with molecularly proven vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 30 (22%) had a history of colonic perforation and 15 (50%) were males. These subjects were diagnosed with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome at a younger age than patients with a history of GI events without colonic perforation (p = 0.0007). There were 46 colonic perforations, median 1.0 event per patient (interquartile range, 1.0-2.0). Reperforations occurred in 14 (47%) patients, mostly males. Surgical management consisted of Hartmann procedures or subtotal abdominal colectomies, with a nonnegligible rate of reperforation following partial colonic resection (11 patients, 41%). LIMITATIONS:The main limitations of this work are its retrospective design and that the diagnosis of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was made after colonic perforations in a majority of patients. CONCLUSION:Colonic perforations seem more severe in males, with a high rate of reperforation after Hartmann procedure. Subtotal colectomy may reduce digestive morbidity, particularly in male patients. Additional studies are required to identify other predictors of reperforation.

Its mortality is secondary to sudden and spontaneous rupture of arteries or hollow organs. The genotype influences the distribution of arterial pathology with aneurysms of intra-abdominal visceral arteries being relatively uncommon. We describe the case of a young man with probable VEDS who died of a spontaneous rupture and dissection of the cystic artery. The patient initially presented with abdominal pain due to an unrecognized spontaneous perforation of the small intestine complicated by sepsis. We postulate that inflammatory mediators may have triggered the arterial rupture due to remodeling and weakening of vessel walls. The phenotype of the patient's vascular damage included bilateral spontaneous carotid-cavernous sinus fistulae and dissection with pseudoaneurysm formation of large- and medium-sized arteries, predominantly the abdominal aorta and its branches. The autopsy uncovered a long history of vascular events that may have been asymptomatic. These findings along with a positive family history supported the VEDS diagnosis. Loeys-Dietz, Marfan, and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection syndromes were ruled out based on the absence of arterial tortuosity, eye abnormalities, bone overgrowth, and the distribution of vascular damage among other features. Interestingly, microscopic examination of the hippocampus revealed a focus of neuronal heterotopia, commonly associated with epilepsy; however, the patient had no history of seizures. The natural course of VEDS involves the rupture and dissection of arteries that, if unrecognized, can lead to a rapid death after bleeding into free spaces."

Spontaneous bowel perforation and intra-abdominal organ rupture are common complications of vEDS. Other gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations may occur but have not been extensively characterized. We herein describe the natural history of GI events and surgery-related complications in patients with vEDS. METHODS:A retrospective review of GI events in a large cohort of molecularly proven vEDS patients was conducted, after exclusion of mild forms of the disease. RESULTS:Of 133 patients, 41% had a history of GI manifestations with 112 events, mean 2.0 ± 1.3 events per patient. There was an earlier occurrence of GI events in men (P 0.008). Cumulative incidence was 58% for all patients, higher in men and in patients with splice-site variants. Recurrence of GI events was reported in more than 50% of patients. Colonic perforation was the first digestive event for 47% of patients. Of 85 GI surgeries, 37 (43%) were complicated with 43 events. Nine deaths were reported in this population. CONCLUSIONS:Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is characterized not only by bowel perforation but also by a wide variety of GI complications that occur in close to half (41%) of patients. The pattern of GI fragility seems more severe in males and splice-site variants. Complications of GI surgery are common and are related with tissue fragility/friability."

We present 23 patients (11 male) from 13 nuclear families followed at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, aged 3-28 years at last follow-up. A total of 28 events of corneal rupture were noted in 17 patients (eight male), among whom nine had had bilateral ruptures, and eight had had unilateral ruptures (four of the right cornea), while two had experienced re-rupture 2 and 4 years, respectively, after surgery; six patients (aged 3-21 years) had had no ruptures. We describe the natural history of our cases and discuss them together with those others reported in the literature. Because of similarities between the BCS and the kyphoscoliotic type of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS VI), both disorders tend to have been confounded. Here, we show that all of our BCS patients tested in this regard had biochemical findings reflective of normal activity of lysyl hydroxylase, characteristically deficient in EDS VI, such as normal urinary total pyridinoline ratios and/or normal electrophoretic migration of collagen chains produced by dermal fibroblasts.

The most recent criteria for the diagnosis of EDS were devised in Villefranche in 1997. [Beighton et al. (1998); Am J Med Genet 77:31-37]. The aims set out in the Villefranche Criteria were: to enable diagnostic uniformity for clinical and research purposes, to understand the natural history of each subtype of EDS, to inform management and genetic counselling, and to identify potential areas of research. The authors recognized that the criteria would need updating, but viewed the Villefranche nosology as a good starting point. Since 1997, there have been major advances in the molecular understanding of classical EDS. Previous question marks over genetic heterogeneity have been largely surpassed by evidence that abnormalities in type V collagen are the cause.

A group of small mammals, including small rodents and shrews, are among the most competent natural reservoirs for three tick-borne zoonotic pathogens, Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, in eastern North America. For a group of nine commonly-infected mammals spanning >2 orders of magnitude in body mass, we asked whether life history features or surrogates for (unknown) encounter rates with ticks, predicted reservoir competence for each pathogen. Life history features associated with a fast pace of life generally were positively correlated with reservoir competence. However, a model comparison approach revealed that host population density, as a proxy for encounter rates between hosts and pathogens, generally received more support than did life history features. The specific life history features and the importance of host population density differed somewhat between the different pathogens. We interpret these results as supporting two alternative but non-exclusive hypotheses for why ecologically widespread, synanthropic species are often the most competent reservoirs for multi-host pathogens. First, multi-host pathogens might adapt to those hosts they are most likely to experience, which are likely to be the most abundant and/or frequently bitten by tick vectors. Second, species with fast life histories might allocate less to certain immune defenses, which could increase their reservoir competence. Results suggest that of the host species that might potentially be exposed, those with comparatively high population densities, small bodies, and fast pace of life will often be keystone reservoirs that should be targeted for surveillance or management."

The complete genome sequence was published in 2005, and during the last two years a new understanding has arisen of the remarkable genetic variability of the organism and new experimental vaccines have been developed. Despite all this the goal of producing an effective vaccine against the disease in the field still remains frustratingly just beyond reach. This article summarises our current understanding of the nature of E. ruminantium, at a time when the prospects for the development of an effective vaccine against the organism seem better than at any time since its discovery 83 years ago."

In humans, the disease can range from a mild, non-specific illness with few to no clinical signs to a moderately severe to fatal disease, especially those with compromised immune systems. E. chaffeensis is maintained in a complex cycle involving white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) as a primary reservoir and the lone star tick (LST; Amblyomma americanum) as a primary vector. Numerous other species are naturally exposed to E. chaffeensis and disease has been documented in some domestic animals and wildlife including domestic dogs and ring-tailed lemurs. The organism has been found throughout the natural range of the LST and as the tick continues to expand its range, the geographic range of risk for E. chaffeensis infections will likely continue to expand. Recent data have indicated that E. chaffeensis, or a closely related organism, has been found in many species of ticks and vertebrate hosts in numerous countries."

Tick-borne fever (TBF), which is caused by the prototype of A. phagocytophilum, was first described in 1932 in Scotland. A similar disease caused by a related granulocytic agent was first described in horses in the USA in 1969; this was followed by the description of two distinct granulocytic agents causing similar diseases in dogs in the USA in 1971 and 1982. Until the discovery of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) in the USA in 1994, these organisms were thought to be distinct species of bacteria infecting specific domestic animals and free-living reservoirs. It is now widely accepted that the agents affecting different animal hosts are variants of the same Gram-negative obligatory intracellular bacterium, which is transmitted by hard ticks belonging to the Ixodes persulcatus complex. One of its fascinating features is that it infects and actively grows in neutrophils by employing an array of mechanisms to subvert their bactericidal activity. It is also able to survive within an apparently immune host by employing a complex mechanism of antigenic variation. Ruminants with TBF and humans with HGA develop severe febrile reaction, bacteraemia and leukopenia due to neutropenia, lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia within a week of exposure to a tick bite. Because of the severe haematological disorders lasting for several days and other adverse effects on the host's immune functions, infected animals and humans are more susceptible to other infections."

We aimed to investigate the association of ALBI score with natural history of chronic HBV infection and treatment response of CHB patients. METHODS:The ALBI score in a cohort of 849 individuals including 721 chronic HBV-infected patients naïve to anti-HBV treatment in different phases and 128 healthy controls were estimated. Additionally, the dynamic changes of ALBI score of 243 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients treated with pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-α) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) were tested for 72 weeks. RESULTS:ALBI score differed among phases, with the highest score in HBeAg-positive CHB patients, followed by HBeAg-negative CHB patients, HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection, and HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection. Besides, CHB patients harbouring high baseline ALBI score exhibited a relatively stronger therapeutic response to PEG-IFN-α or NAs. Moreover, the rate of HBeAg and HBsAg loss in patients with ALBI grade 2 was persistently higher than that in patients with ALBI grade 1 throughout the course of treatment. Furthermore, ALBI score was an independent predictor of sustained response achievement. The combined use of ALBI score, HBeAg and ALT could enhance the predictive value of treatment response. CONCLUSIONS:ALBI score differed significantly across the natural course of chronic HBV infection and was correlated with PEG-IFN-α and NAs treatment response in HBeAg-positive CHB patients, which suggested that ALBI score could be useful as an auxiliary clinical factor to determine the initiation of therapy and predict stronger antiviral treatment response."

In the present study, I propose that heritable intraspecific variation in prey, which facilitates natural selection, is a key to solve this issue. A mathematical model reveals that diverse genotypes in a prey promote the coexistence of multiple predator species. When two predators share a prey with multiple genotypes, evolution nearly selects the two prey genotypes. Through analysis, I establish a condition of coexistence of such multiple predator-one prey interaction with two genotypes. If each prey type has high defensive capacity against different predator species, stable coexistence is likely to occur. Particularly, interspecific variations of life-history parameters allow the coexistence equilibrium to be stable. In addition, rapid evolution in a prey allows more than two predator species to coexist. Furthermore, mutation tends to stabilize otherwise unstable systems. These results suggest that intraspecific variation in a prey plays a key role in the maintenance of diverse predator species by driving adaptive evolution."

Species-area relationship (SAR) models traditionally have been used for estimating species richness, species loss as a function of habitat loss, and extrapolation of richness for given areas. Sampling-species relationships (SSRs) are interrelated yet separate drivers for species richness estimates. Traditionally, however, SAR and SSR models have been used independently and not incorporated into a single approach. We developed and compared predictive models that incorporate sampling effort species-area relationships (SESARS) along the entire Atlantic Forest of South America, and then applied the best-fit model to estimate richness in forest remnants of Interior Atlantic Forest of eastern Paraguay. This framework was applied to non-volant small mammal assemblages that reflect different tolerances to forest loss and fragmentation. In order to account for differences in functionality we estimated small mammal richness of 1) the entire non-volant small mammal assemblage, including introduced species; 2) the native species forest assemblage; and 3) the forest-specialist assemblage, with the latter two assemblages being subsets of the entire assemblage. Finally, we geospatially modeled species richness for each of the three assemblages throughout eastern Paraguay to identify remnants with high species richness. We found that multiple regression power-law interaction-term models that only included area and the interactions of area and sampling as predictors, worked best for predicting species richness for the entire assemblage and the native species forest assemblage, while several traditional SAR models (logistic, power, exponential, and ratio) best described forest-specialist richness. Species richness was significantly different between assemblages. We identified obvious remnants with high species richness in eastern Paraguay, and these remnants often were geographically isolated. We also found relatively high predicted species richness (in relation to the entire range of predicted richness values) in several geographically-isolated, medium-size forest remnants that likely have not been considered as possible priority areas for conservation. These findings highlight the importance of using an empirical dataset, created using sources representing diverse sampling efforts, to develop robust predictive models. This approach is particularly important in geographic locations where field sampling is limited yet the geographic area is experiencing rapid and dramatic land cover changes. When combined, area and sampling are powerful modeling predictors for questions of biogeography, ecology, and conservation, especially when addressing habitat loss and fragmentation."

However, their use is subject to a number of challenges, principally the identification of taxa within the images without associated physical specimens. The challenge of applying traditional taxonomic keys to the identification of fauna from images has led to the development of personal, group, or institution level reference image catalogues of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or morphospecies. Lack of standardisation among these reference catalogues has led to problems with observer bias and the inability to combine datasets across studies. In addition, lack of a common reference standard is stifling efforts in the application of artificial intelligence to taxon identification. Using the North Atlantic deep sea as a case study, we propose a database structure to facilitate standardisation of morphospecies image catalogues between research groups and support future use in multiple front-end applications. We also propose a framework for coordination of international efforts to develop reference guides for the identification of marine species from images. The proposed structure maps to the Darwin Core standard to allow integration with existing databases. We suggest a management framework where high-level taxonomic groups are curated by a regional team, consisting of both end users and taxonomic experts. We identify a mechanism by which overall quality of data within a common reference guide could be raised over the next decade.

METHODS: All patients diagnosed antenatally with cystic lung malformations from 2001 to 2011, at a tertiary referral paediatric surgical centre practising a policy of conservative management of asymptomatic cases, were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected from medical case notes and radiology reports. Ethical approval was obtained from our institutional research and development department. RESULTS: The complete records of 74 fetuses antenatally diagnosed with CLM were reviewed. There were 72 live births, at a median gestation of 39.6 weeks. Emergency lobectomy was performed in one symptomatic neonate. Elective lobectomies were performed at parental request in three asymptomatic infants, one of whom had a family history of synovial sarcoma. Two patients developed pneumonia in the affected lobe during early childhood and proceeded to lobectomy at the age of 3 years. One patient with a bronchopulmonary sequestration required embolisation for cyanotic episodes. The remaining 65 patients have been conservatively managed to date, and none have required hospital admission. Less than a quarter report mild respiratory symptoms such as cough or wheeze. Median follow-up is 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective cohort study of 74 consecutive CLMs diagnosed antenatally over a 10-year period demonstrates that most of these lesions will remain asymptomatic throughout childhood. Although the natural history of CLMs in later years remains to be elucidated, we hope that this report on medium-term outcomes will be useful to clinicians who undertake antenatal counselling and may inform the discussion on how best to manage these children."

STATE OF THE ART: Congenital lung lesions are frequently diagnosed antenatally and many remain asymptomatic after birth. In the absence of antenatal identification, they are usually revealed by the occurrence of infection. In some cases, spontaneous resolution of the malformation can occur. Different pathogenic hypotheses are discussed for the origin of these abnormalities, and common processes appear likely to all of these malformations. Factors involved in the process of branching seem to play a particularly important role. PERSPECTIVES: Prospective follow-up of operated and unoperated children would complete our knowledge about the natural history of these lesions.

AIMS: To better define the phenotypic spectrum and natural history of ECCL and to revise diagnostic criteria. METHODS: 54 patients with ECCL were reviewed. RESULTS: Eye anomalies (mainly choristomas) and skin lesions (non-scarring alopecia, naevus psiloliparus, subcutaneous fatty masses, nodular skin tags, aplastic scalp defects) may be unilateral or bilateral and occur in a consistent pattern. Central nervous system anomalies consist of intracranial and intraspinal lipomas, congenital abnormalities of the meninges, and putative focal vascular defects resulting in highly asymmetrical changes. About two-thirds of patients have a normal development or mild retardation only, and half of them have seizures. No correlation between the extent of central nervous system anomalies and neurological features could be established. Aortic coarctation, progressive bone cysts and jaw tumours may be associated. CONCLUSIONS: Revised diagnostic criteria are proposed. ECCL is considered to differ from Proteus syndrome in particular, but oculoectodermal syndrome is possibly a mild variant.

Our aim was to describe clinical and brain magnetic resonance imaging characteristics, genetic findings and natural history of patients with adult-onset eIF2B-related disorders. METHODS: The inclusion criteria were based on the presence of EIF2B mutations and a disease onset after the age of 16 years. One patient with an asymptomatic diagnosis was also included. Clinical and MRI findings were retrospectively recorded in all patients. This multicentric study included 24 patients from 22 families. RESULTS: A sex-ratio imbalance was noted (male/female=5/19). The mean age of onset was 30 years (range 12-62). Initial symptoms were neurologic (n=20), psychiatric (n=3) and ovarian failure (n=6). During follow-up (mean: 11 years, range 2-35 years), two patients died. Of the 22 survivors, 67% showed a decline in their cognitive functions and mean EDSS was 5.6 (range=0-9.5). One case remained asymptomatic. Stress worsened clinical symptoms in 33% of the patients. Magnetic resonance imaging findings consisted of cerebral atrophy (92%), extensive cystic leucoencephalopathy (83%), corpus callosum involvement (92%) and cerebellar (37%) T2-weighted hyperintensities. Most patients (83%) showed mutations in the EIF2B5 gene. The recurrent p.Arg113His-eIF2Be mutation was found at a homozygous state in 58% of the 24 eIF2B-mutated patients. CONCLUSION: eIF2B-related disorder is probably underestimated as an adult-onset inherited leucoencephalopathy. Cerebral atrophy is constant, whereas the typical vanishing of the white matter can be absent. Functional and cognitive prognosis remains severe. Molecular diagnosis is facilitated for these forms by screening for the recurrent p.Arg113His-eIF2Be mutation."

The syndrome is characterized by (i) cerebellar and pyramidal signs in children aged 2-5 years; (ii) extensive cavitating leucoencephalopathy; and (iii) episodes of rapid deterioration following stress. Since then a broad clinical spectrum from congenital to adult-onset forms has been reported, leading to the concept of eIF2B-related disorders. Our aim was to describe clinical and brain magnetic resonance imaging characteristics, genetic findings and natural history of patients with adult-onset eIF2B-related disorders (after age 16). The inclusion criteria were based on the presence of eIF2B mutations and a disease onset after the age of 16 years. One patient with an asymptomatic diagnosis (age 16 years) was also included. Clinical and magnetic resonance findings were retrospectively recorded in all patients. All patients were examined to assess clinical evolution, using functional, pyramidal, cerebellar and cognitive scales. This multi-centric study included 16 patients from 14 families. A sex ratio imbalance was noted (male/female = 3/13). The mean age of onset was 31.1 years (range 16-62). Initial symptoms were neurologic (n = 11), psychiatric (n = 2) and ovarian failure (n = 2). Onset of the symptoms was linked to a precipitating factor in 13% of cases that included minor head trauma and delivery. During follow-up (mean: 11.2 years, range 2-22 years) 12.5% of the patients died. Of the 14 survivors, 62% showed a decline in their cognitive functions, and 79% were severely handicapped or bedridden. One case remained asymptomatic. Stress worsened clinical symptoms in 38% of the patients. Magnetic resonance imaging findings consist of constant cerebral atrophy, extensive cystic leucoencephalopathy (81%), corpus callosum (69%) and cerebellar (38%) T2-weighted hyperintensities. All families except one showed mutations in the EIF2B5 gene. The recurrent p.Arg113His-eIF2Bepsilon mutation was found in 79% of the 14 eIF2B-mutated families, mainly at a homozygous state. The family with a mutation in EIF2B2 had the relatively prevalent p.Glu213Gly mutation. eIF2B-related disorder is probably underestimated as an adult-onset inherited leucoencephalopathy. In this late-onset form, presentation ranges from neurologic symptoms to psychiatric manifestations or primary ovarian failure. Cerebral atrophy is constant, whereas the typical vanishing of the white matter can be absent. Functional and/or cognitive prognosis remains severe. Molecular diagnosis is facilitated for these forms by the screening of the two recurrent p.Arg113His-eIF2Bepsilon and p.Glu213Gly-eIF2Bbeta mutations, positive in 86% of cases."

Unlike tubulopathy, which responds to improved metabolic control, glomerulopathy in GSD I is considered refractory to medical intervention, and it is thought to inexorably progress to overt proteinuria and renal failure. Recent reports of reduced microalbuminuria following strict adherence to therapy counter this view. In contrast to type Ia, little is known regarding the prevalence of kidney disease in GSD Ib, 0, III, VI, and IX. Subjects were evaluated with 24-h urine collections between 2005 and 2014 as part of a longitudinal study of the natural history of GSD. ACE inhibitor therapy (AIT) was commenced after documentation of microalbuminuria. Elevated urine albumin excretion was detected in 23 of 195 GSD Ia patients (11.7%) and six of 45 GSD Ib (13.3%). The median age of onset of microalbuminuria in GSD Ia was 24 years (range 9-56); in GSD Ib it was 25 years (range 20-38). Of 14 with GSD Ia who complied with dietary and AIT during the study period, microalbuminuria decreased in 11, in whom metabolic control improved. All 135 patients with the ketotic forms of GSD (0, III, VI and IX) consistently had normal microalbumin excretion. Strict adherence to dietary therapy and maintenance of optimal metabolic control is necessary to halt the progression of GSD Ia glomerulopathy in patients treated with AIT. With optimal care, protein excretion can be reduced and even normalize."

While scoliosis is common in many other neuromuscular disorders, there is little information on its prevalence and impact in Pompe disease. To further our understanding, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Pompe Registry, a multinational, long-term observational program that contains the largest collection of data in the world of patients with Pompe disease. In this analysis, patients were categorized by age during the natural history period (defined as the time when patients never received enzyme replacement therapy) and by age at onset of symptoms as infants (≤0 to <2 years of age); children (≥2 to <13 years of age); juveniles (≥13 to <20 years of age); and adults (≥20 years of age). Scoliosis was defined by clinical assessment, X-ray of the spine, or both. Data on scoliosis were available in the majority of patients enrolled in the registry as of September 2010 (711/873, 81.4%). Scoliosis was present in a third of all patients with scoliosis data (235/711, 33%) in the Pompe Disease Registry. Scoliosis was found more frequently in patients with onset of Pompe symptoms as children (57.0%) and juveniles (52.9%) than in patients with onset of symptoms as adults (24.8%). Only 18.4% (38/206) of patients with onset of symptoms as infants were reported as having scoliosis. Scoliosis was reported in the majority (62.5%) of wheelchair users for all age groups. A larger percentage of patients with scoliosis required respiratory support than patients without scoliosis (44% vs 27.2%, respectively), and pulmonary function in those with scoliosis was consistently reduced in the 3 older age groups compared to those without scoliosis, with the largest differences demonstrated in juveniles. Patients with scoliosis had been diagnosed with Pompe disease for a mean of 1.2 (±14.34) years before the first reporting of scoliosis. As with other registry analyses, data were collected from multiple sites in different countries and assessments of scoliosis therefore may not be based on consistent criteria. However, the observed occurrence of scoliosis across all age groups of patients with Pompe disease and its association with increased clinical morbidity, underscores the need for clinical assessment of scoliosis in all patients with Pompe disease."

The X-linked nature of inheritance accounts for reported differences in phenotypic severity between men and women. The rarity of Danon disease has limited understanding of the complete phenotype. Clinical estimates of ages of disease onset and survival based on gender have not been published. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present data on 82 patients with Danon disease from 36 families, the largest series to date. Men were severely affected with cognitive disabilities (100%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (88%), and muscle weakness (80%). Men had a high morbidity and were unlikely to reach the age of 25 years without a cardiac transplantation. Women were less severely affected but reported higher than expected levels of cognitive (47%) and skeletal muscle complaints (50%) and manifesting an equal prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Combining our data with that of 63 other Danon disease case reports in the literature, the average ages of first symptom, cardiac transplantation, and death were 12.1, 17.9, and 19.0 years in men and 27.9, 33.7, and 34.6 years in women, respectively. CONCLUSION: These data more broadly illuminate the Danon disease phenotype and should prove useful to physicians working with and providing genetic counseling to families with Danon disease. Women with Danon disease present with clinical symptoms and events approximately 15 years after men and report a higher proportion of cognitive and skeletal muscle problems than previously recognized."

Records from 56 individuals were reviewed and demonstrated fractures, scoliosis, and non-congenital hypophosphatemia that in some cases were resolved. Phosphate and calcitriol, but not skin lesion removal, were effective at controlling hypophosphatemia. No skeletal malignancies were found. PURPOSE:CSHS is a disorder defined by the association of epidermal and/or melanocytic nevi, a mosaic skeletal dysplasia, and an FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia. To date, somatic RAS mutations have been identified in all patients whose affected tissue has undergone DNA sequencing. However, the clinical spectrum and treatment are poorly defined in CSHS. The purpose of this study is to determine the spectrum of the phenotype, natural history of the disease, and response to treatment of hypophosphatemia. METHODS:Five CSHS subjects underwent prospective data collection at clinical research centers. A review of the literature identified 45 reports that included a total of 51 additional patients, in whom the findings were compatible with CSHS. Data on nevi subtypes, bone histology, mineral and skeletal disorders, abnormalities in other tissues, and response to treatment of hypophosphatemia were analyzed. RESULTS:Fractures, limb deformities, and scoliosis affected most CSHS subjects. Hypophosphatemia was not present at birth. Histology revealed severe osteomalacia but no other abnormalities. Skeletal dysplasia was reported in all anatomical compartments, though less frequently in the spine; there was no clear correlation between the location of nevi and the skeletal lesions. Phosphate and calcitriol supplementation was the most effective therapy for rickets. Convincing data that nevi removal improved blood phosphate levels was lacking. An age-dependent improvement in mineral abnormalities was observed. A spectrum of extra-osseous/extra-cutaneous manifestations that included both benign and malignant neoplasms was present in many subjects, though osteosarcoma remains unreported. CONCLUSION:An understanding of the spectrum, natural history, and efficacy of treatment of hypophosphatemia in CSHS may improve the care of these patients."

OBJECTIVES:To determine the clinical course of growth and anaemia in children with EB and clarify the impact of nutritional compromise, inflammation and genetic factors. METHODS:A retrospective study was conducted of 200 children, 157 with recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB) and 43 with junctional EB (JEB)-generalized intermediate, followed at the main referral centre in Germany. Growth charts were calculated using the modified LMS method and were correlated with parameters of anaemia, nutrition, inflammation and the molecular defect in a linear model. RESULTS:In our cohort of patients with RDEB, weight impairment started at 12-18 months old; by the age of 10 years, 50% showed wasting. The predicted median weight at age 20 years was 35·2 kg for men and 40·1 kg for women. In JEB, growth resembled that of healthy children. Anaemia was present from the second year of life onwards in RDEB and JEB. Low levels of haemoglobin, iron, vitamin D, zinc and albumin, high levels of C-reactive protein, and absence of collagen VII correlated significantly with low weight in RDEB. No correlation was observed in JEB. CONCLUSIONS:The results highlight that nutritional compromise occurs early in children with RDEB and therefore may require interventions as of the first year or two of life. What's already known about this topic? Children with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) suffer from failure to thrive and anaemia as major extracutaneous complications. The course of growth and the development of anaemia in EB are poorly characterized. What does this study add? A molecularly well characterized cohort of 200 children with EB was followed with regard to anthropometrics, anaemia and inflammation.

These adhesion proteins are also present in normal hair follicles. Anecdotally, there have been reports of scalp alopecia as a complication of EB and there are scattered cases in the literature, but alopecia has generally been overlooked in severe blistering diseases because it is regarded as a cosmetic issue. Therefore, there is no consensus about the natural history and clinical manifestations of alopecia in EB to allow potential intervention. OBJECTIVES:To review the current literature detailing the pathogenesis and clinical presentations of alopecia in EB patients. METHODS:Relevant human studies were searched in Medline, PubMed, and EMBASE electronic databases up to October 2018. RESULTS:Only 15 reports detailed 29 EB patients with demographic and clinical manifestations of alopecia. Vertical biopsy sections were the most common method of alopecia diagnosis, and the most common pattern was patchy scalp alopecia (45%) followed by diffuse alopecia (41%). The most robust finding was nonspecific scarring alopecia in all dystrophic EB (DEB) patients and nonspecific nonscarring alopecia in most patients with EB simplex (EBS). CONCLUSIONS:Hair abnormalities observed in EB are of variable severity despite there being no universal validated alopecia scoring system, with alopecia occurring secondary to blistering, or in areas prone to trauma."

Machine-learning methods based on spoken language can detect suicidality in adults. This study's purpose was to use spoken words to create machine-learning classifiers that identify current or lifetime history of comorbid psychiatric conditions in teenagers and young adults with epilepsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Eligible participants were >12 years old with epilepsy. All participants were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) or the MINI Kid Tracking and asked five open-ended conversational questions. N-grams and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) word categories were used to construct machine learning classification models from language harvested from interviews. Data were analyzed for four individual MINI identified disorders and for three mutually exclusive groups: participants with no psychiatric disorders, participants with non-suicidal psychiatric disorders, and participants with any degree of suicidality. Performance was measured using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROCs). RESULTS:Classifiers were constructed from 227 interviews with 122 participants (7.5 ± 3.1 minutes and 454 ± 299 words). AROCs for models differentiating the non-overlapping groups and individual disorders ranged 57%-78% (many with P < .02). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:Machine-learning classifiers of spoken language can reliably identify current or lifetime history of suicidality and depression in people with epilepsy. Data suggest identification of anxiety and bipolar disorders may be achieved with larger data sets. Machine-learning analysis of spoken language can be promising as a useful screening alternative when traditional approaches are unwieldy (eg, telephone calls, primary care offices, school health clinics)."

However, orphan drug development is of increasing interest because of the legislation enabling facilitated support by regulatory agencies through scientific advice, and the protection of the molecules with orphan designation. In the landscape of the rare epilepsies, very few syndromes, namely Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome, have been subject to orphan drug development. Despite orphan designations for rare epilepsies having dramatically increased in the past 10 years, the number of approved drugs remains limited and restricted to a handful of epilepsy syndromes. In this paper, we describe the current state of orphan drug development for rare epilepsies. We identified a large number of compounds currently under investigation, but mostly in the same rare epilepsy syndromes as in the past. A rationale for further development in rare epilepsies could be based on the match between the drug mechanisms of action and the knowledge of the causative gene mutation or by evidence from animal models. In case of the absence of strong pathophysiological hypotheses, exploratory/basket clinical studies could be helpful to identify a subpopulation that may benefit from the new drug. We provide some suggestions for future improvements in orphan drug development such as promoting paediatric drug investigations, better evaluation of the incidence and the prevalence, together with the natural history data, and the development of new primary outcomes."

Patients with NF1 are at increased risk for central nervous system (CNS) manifestations including structural, functional, and neoplastic disease. The mechanisms underlying the varied manifestations of NF1 are incompletely understood, but the loss of functional neurofibromin, resulting in sustained activation of the oncoprotein RAS, is responsible for tumorigenesis throughout the body, including the CNS. Much of our understanding of NF1-related CNS manifestations is from a combination of data from animal models and natural history studies of people with NF1 and CNS disease. Data from animal models suggest the importance of both Nf1 mutations and somatic genetic alterations, such as Tp53 loss, for development of neoplasms, as well as the role of the timing of the acquisition of such alterations on the variability of CNS manifestations. A variety of non-neoplastic structural (macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, aqueductal stenosis, and vasculopathy) and functional (epilepsy, impaired cognition, attention deficits, and autism spectrum disorder) abnormalities occur with variable frequency in individuals with NF1. In addition, there is increasing evidence that similar appearing CNS neoplasms in people with and without the NF1 syndrome are due to distinct oncogenic pathways. Gliomas in people with NF1 show alterations in the RAS/MAPK pathway, generally in the absence of BRAF alterations (common to sporadic pilocytic astrocytomas) or IDH or histone H3 mutations (common to diffuse gliomas subsets). A subset of low-grade astrocytomas in these patients remain difficult to classify using standard criteria, and occasionally demonstrate morphologic features resembling subependymal giant cell astrocytomas that afflict patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (""SEGA-like astrocytomas""). There is also emerging evidence that NF1-associated high-grade astrocytomas have frequent co-existing alterations such as ATRX mutations and an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype responsible for unique biologic properties. Ongoing efforts are seeking to improve diagnostic accuracy for CNS neoplasms in the setting of NF1 versus sporadic tumors. In addition, MEK inhibitors, which act on the RAS/MAPK pathway, continue to be studied as rational targets for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors, including CNS tumors."

Its mortality is secondary to sudden and spontaneous rupture of arteries or hollow organs. The genotype influences the distribution of arterial pathology with aneurysms of intra-abdominal visceral arteries being relatively uncommon. We describe the case of a young man with probable VEDS who died of a spontaneous rupture and dissection of the cystic artery. The patient initially presented with abdominal pain due to an unrecognized spontaneous perforation of the small intestine complicated by sepsis. We postulate that inflammatory mediators may have triggered the arterial rupture due to remodeling and weakening of vessel walls. The phenotype of the patient's vascular damage included bilateral spontaneous carotid-cavernous sinus fistulae and dissection with pseudoaneurysm formation of large- and medium-sized arteries, predominantly the abdominal aorta and its branches. The autopsy uncovered a long history of vascular events that may have been asymptomatic. These findings along with a positive family history supported the VEDS diagnosis. Loeys-Dietz, Marfan, and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection syndromes were ruled out based on the absence of arterial tortuosity, eye abnormalities, bone overgrowth, and the distribution of vascular damage among other features. Interestingly, microscopic examination of the hippocampus revealed a focus of neuronal heterotopia, commonly associated with epilepsy; however, the patient had no history of seizures. The natural course of VEDS involves the rupture and dissection of arteries that, if unrecognized, can lead to a rapid death after bleeding into free spaces."

Results:A total of 133 subjects with SSADH deficiency are enrolled in the registry; 49 participated in the longitudinal study. The age range of the population is 8 weeks to 63 years (median 7.75 year; 44% male).

A depressed ratio of apolipoprotein A-1 to apolipoprotein B (using adult normative values) was seen in half of the entire cohort. Clinical features of children with unexplained ischemic strokes at presentation and their subsequent course are described. Significant risk factors for a poor outcome include (1) persistence of hemiparesis 1 month after the stroke, (2) cortical as opposed to subcortical location, and (3) bilateral occlusive disease with telangiectasia on cerebral angiography. Previously described risk factors for an unfavorable prognosis, including occurrence during infancy and presentation with seizures, were not substantiated. Lipid abnormalities occur at an increased frequency in children after unexplained ischemic strokes. Prospective assessment of lipoprotein profiles are needed to further assess clinical significance. Assessing apolipoproteins may provide further insight than lipid values alone."
