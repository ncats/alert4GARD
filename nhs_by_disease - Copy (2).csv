Clinical findings in the first few months included somewhat unusual appearance and hepatosplenomegaly. Dysostosis multiplex was evident by age 2 1/2 years. Mitral and aortic valvular disease appeared over the next few years and cardiac disease has become the most important clinical problem. Foam cells were present in the bone marrow, and vacuolated lymphocytes were present in the peripheral blood smear. The patient had no neurological symptoms, cherry red spots, or intellectual deterioration during the first 18 years. Evidence presented elsewhere indicates that the basic defect in this late infantile form of galactosialidosis (as is thought to be true for the other forms of galactosialidosis) is a reduced amount of the 32 kDa phosphoglycoprotein which associates with beta-galactosidase and alpha-neuraminidase in lysosomes."

The usual presentation is on 1 side of the body and on 1 side of the epiphysis. The natural history of this disease is not clear because the lesions often are treated during childhood. Additionally, hip involvement is relatively uncommon; to our knowledge, total hip arthroplasty in a patient with DEH has not been reported previously. Our patient presented with previously untreated DEH of the hip joint, which had developed into a very unusual shape. He was treated with a total hip arthroplasty and had satisfactory functioning 2.5 years postsurgery. CONCLUSION:Untreated DEH of the hip can lead to a very misshapen hip with a deformed femoral head and loss of the shape of the acetabulum, as well as stiffness due to an unusual shape and osteoarthritic changes. A total hip arthroplasty can give satisfactory functional results."

Additionally, recent publications have provided insights into how newer and emerging treatment options are becoming more common for this condition. With gene therapy being approved in the United States for the severe form, the dystrophinopathies represent model diseases to understand the personalization of genetic treatment.

These mutations form a complex spectrum. A national registration network is essential not only to provide more information about the prevalence and natural history of the disease, but also to collect genetic data for analyzing the mutational spectrum. This information is extremely beneficial for basic scientific research, genetic diagnosis, trial planning, clinical care, and gene therapy. METHODS:We collected data from 1400 patients (1042 patients with confirmed unrelated Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD] or Becker muscular dystrophy [BMD]) registered in the Chinese Genetic Disease Registry from March 2012 to August 2017 and analyzed the genetic mutational characteristics of these patients. RESULTS:Large deletions were the most frequent type of mutation (72.2%), followed by nonsense mutations (11.9%), exon duplications (8.8%), small deletions (3.0%), splice-site mutations (2.1%), small insertions (1.3%), missense mutations (0.6%), and a combination mutation of a deletion and a duplication (0.1%). Exon 45-50 deletion was the most frequent deletion type, while exon 2 duplication was the most common duplication type. Two deletion hotspots were calculated-one located toward the central part (exon 45-52) of the gene and the other toward the 5'end (exon 8-26). We found no significant difference between hereditary and de novo mutations on deletion hotspots. Nonsense mutations accounted for 62.9% of all small mutations (197 patients). CONCLUSION:We built a comprehensive national dystrophinopathy mutation database in China, which is essential for basic and clinical research in this field. The mutational spectrum and characteristics of this DMD/BMD group were largely consistent with those in previous international DMD/BMD studies, with some differences. Based on our results, about 12% of DMD/BMD patients with nonsense mutations may benefit from stop codon read-through therapy. Additionally, the top three targets for exon-skipping therapy are exon 51 (141, 13.5%), exon 53 (115, 11.0%), and exon 45 (84, 8.0%)."

OBJECTIVES:The present study used data from Remudy, a national registry for neuromuscular diseases in Japan, to conduct a phenotypic analysis of BMD. METHODS:We analyzed Remudy data of participants with dystrophinopathy. All participants who were aged 17 and older and were ambulant at age 13 were included in this study. Participants were divided into two groups: those with BMD who were ambulant at age 17, and those with intermediate muscular dystrophy (IMD) who lost ambulation by age 17. Frequent mutations were analyzed by age at ambulation, cardiopulmonary function, and genotype. For clinical comparisons, participants who were administered steroids were excluded. RESULTS:From July 2009 through September 2015, 192 participants had registered with Remudy. Mean participant age was 34.80±13.3 (range, 17-78) years, and 52.1% of participants were ambulant. Of the entire study population, 50.5% had cardiomyopathy and 35.9% had respiratory failure. Three participants required invasive ventilation and 30 required non-invasive ventilation. Nineteen of the 30 non-invasive ventilator users were part-time users. In total, 138 (71.9%) had BMD and 54 (28.1%) had IMD. The most frequent mutation was ex45_ex47del (36 participants). Among participants with frequent in-frame mutations, those with the ex45-49del mutation lost their ambulation earlier than those with the ex45_ex47del mutation. A total of 67 different exon deletions and duplications were identified in the study population. CONCLUSION:We clarified the clinical phenotypes of Japanese patients with BMD/IMD using data from Remudy. Our results suggest that not only IMD but also BMD are associated with risk of respiratory dysfunction."

This suggests the existence of trans-acting variants in modifier genes. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes (SPP1, encoding osteopontin, and LTBP4, encoding latent transforming growth factor β [TGFβ]-binding protein 4) have been established as DMD modifiers. We performed a genome-wide association study of age at LoA in a sub-cohort of European or European American ancestry (n = 109) from the Cooperative International Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study (CINRG-DNHS). We focused on protein-altering variants (Exome Chip) and included glucocorticoid treatment as a covariate. As expected, due to the small population size, no SNPs displayed an exome-wide significant p value (< 1.8 × 10-6). Subsequently, we prioritized 438 SNPs in the vicinities of 384 genes implicated in DMD-related pathways, i.e., the nuclear-factor-κB and TGFβ pathways. The minor allele at rs1883832, in the 5'-untranslated region of CD40, was associated with earlier LoA (p = 3.5 × 10-5). This allele diminishes the expression of CD40, a co-stimulatory molecule for T cell polarization. We validated this association in multiple independent DMD cohorts (United Dystrophinopathy Project, Bio-NMD, and Padova, total n = 660), establishing this locus as a DMD modifier. This finding points to cell-mediated immunity as a relevant pathogenetic mechanism and potential therapeutic target in DMD."

While a number of international treaties call for the implementation of EAF, there are still gaps in the underlying methodology. One aspect that has received substantial scientific attention recently is fisheries-induced evolution (FIE). Increasing evidence indicates that intensive fishing has the potential to exert strong directional selection on life-history traits, behaviour, physiology, and morphology of exploited fish. Of particular concern is that reversing evolutionary responses to fishing can be much more difficult than reversing demographic or phenotypically plastic responses. Furthermore, like climate change, multiple agents cause FIE, with effects accumulating over time. Consequently, FIE may alter the utility derived from fish stocks, which in turn can modify the monetary value living aquatic resources provide to society. Quantifying and predicting the evolutionary effects of fishing is therefore important for both ecological and economic reasons. An important reason this is not happening is the lack of an appropriate assessment framework. We therefore describe the evolutionary impact assessment (EvoIA) as a structured approach for assessing the evolutionary consequences of fishing and evaluating the predicted evolutionary outcomes of alternative management options. EvoIA can contribute to EAF by clarifying how evolution may alter stock properties and ecological relations, support the precautionary approach to fisheries management by addressing a previously overlooked source of uncertainty and risk, and thus contribute to sustainable fisheries."

Up to 104 phytophagous species have been reported causing damage to leaves, buds and fruits, but only a dozen can be considered major pests requiring control measures. In recent years, several species have expanded their geographical range primarily due to the great increase in trade and travel worldwide, representing a threat to agriculture in many countries. Three spider mite species (Acari: Tetranychidae) have recently invaded the citrus-growing areas in the Mediterranean region and Latin America. The Oriental red mite, Eutetranychus orientalis (Klein), presumably from the Near East, was detected in southern Spain in 2001. The Texas citrus mite, Eutetranychus banksi (McGregor), is widely distributed in North, Central and South America. It was first reported in Europe in 1999 on citrus in Portugal; afterwards the mite invaded the citrus orchards in southern Spain. In Latin America, the Hindustan citrus mite, Schizotetranychus hindustanicus (Hirst), previously known only from citrus and other host plants in India, was reported causing significant damage to citrus leaves and fruits in Zulia, northwest Venezuela, in the late 1990s. Later, this mite species spread to the southeast being detected on lemon trees in the state of Roraima in northern Brazil in 2008. Whereas damage levels, population dynamics and control measures are relatively well know in the case of Oriental red mite and Texas citrus mite, our knowledge of S. hindustanicus is noticeably scant. In the present paper, information on pest status, seasonal trends and natural enemies in invaded areas is provided for these species, together with morphological data useful for identification. Because invasive species may evolve during the invasion process, comparison of behavior, damage and management options between native and invaded areas for these species will be useful for understanding the invader's success and their ability to colonize new regions."

The agent is an enveloped RNA virus with a non-segmented single-stranded negative-sense genome. The viral genome encodes 8 structural and 2 non-structural proteins. Important structural proteins include the fusion (F) protein and the attachment (G) protein which are essential for viral penetration and attachment to the host cells. Both proteins are important in development of immune responses. The virus is estimated to cause 3000 to 4000 deaths annually. Primary infections are as a rule symptomatic. The spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from mild upper tract illness, infection in middle ear which progresses to acute otitis media, croup, to apnoea in premature infants, pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Premature babies born at 30-35 weeks of gestation, infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease, HIV-infected subjects, and patients on intensive immunosuppressive therapy especially after bone marrow transplant are considered to be at risk for increased mortality and morbidity during RSV infection. The virus does not normally replicate outside of the bronchopulmonary tree and the infection is exquisitely restricted to the respiratory mucosa. However, development of extrapulmonary disease has been observed in certain T and B cell immunodeficiency states. The association of RSV with asthma and reversible reactive airway disease in early childhood has attracted significant attention. Recurrent wheezing for up to 5 to 7 years of age and established airway disease has been observed in a significant number of children with a strong family history of allergy, after primary infection or reinfection with RSV. Immune response to primary infection is relatively small but on reinfection, a significant booster effect with sustained immunologic reactivity is observed in serum and respiratory mucosa. Both CD(4)- and CD(8)-specific as well as Th(1)- and Th(2)-cell specific immune responses have been observed during human infection. In addition, proinflammatory as well as immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines are induced in the respiratory tract after natural and induced (in vitro) infection. Significant progress has been made in understanding the role of Th(1) vs. Th(2), IgE, viral induced cytokines and chemokines in the mechanisms of pathogenesis of the disease, development of wheezing and in the prevention and treatment of the infection and its sequelae. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the commonest human viral infections, and virtually every child is infected by the third birthday. Because of its restricted mucosal immunopathology, and frequent association with bronchial hyperreactivity and development of wheezing, RSV has served as an important model to investigate mechanisms of mucosal immune responses and development of mucosal disease following infection. The importance of RSV in bronchopulmonary disease and development of bronchial hyperreactivity has been the focus of several recent symposia [Kimpen JL, Simoes EAF. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2001; 163:S1-S6]. This brief report will only summarise, based on selected references, the historical landmarks of its discovery and current understanding of the mechanisms of immunity, and their possible role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary disease."

The stability and response of these foci to various doses of the hepatic promoting agent, phenobarbital (PB), were studied. The number of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase-positive (GGT+) EAF resulting from PH/DEN followed by PB (0.05%) administration for 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months or 4 months did not significantly change when the administration of the promoting agent was followed by a 6-month period of a diet containing no PB. These data demonstrate the stability of the foci induced by the PH/DEN/PB regimen and indicate that the increased number of foci resulting from PB promotion in the absence of overt hepatic necrosis are not reversible on removal of the promoting stimulus. Chronic administration of dose levels of PB below 0.001% in the diet failed to demonstrate an increase in the number of EAF over the number in the control animals not promoted with PB. A linear increase in the number of EAF was observed when rats were chronically fed doses of PB ranging between 0.001% and 0.05% in the diet, whereas diet concentrations of PB greater than 0.05% did not result in any further increase in the number of EAF. The number of EAF resulting from PH/DEN followed by 0.05% PB in the diet increased during the first 3-4 months of promotion. Thereafter, the number of foci did not change despite the continued administration of PB for as long as 8 months. These data suggest the presence of an apparent threshold (no effect level) for promotion by PB and demonstrate the presence of a maximal response of EAF to this promoting agent after initiation by a single dose of DEN."

Among these, there is a long history of infectious diseases that have spread from non-human primates (NHP) to humans. For millennia, indigenous groups that depend on wildlife for their survival were exposed to the risk of NHP pathogens' transmission through animal hunting and wild meat consumption. Usually, exposure is of no consequence or is limited to mild infections. In rare situations, it can be more severe or even become a real public health concern. Since the emergence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), nobody can ignore that an emerging infectious diseases (EID) might spread from NHP into the human population. In large parts of Central Africa and Asia, wildlife remains the primary source of meat and income for millions of people living in rural areas. However, in the past few decades the risk of exposure to an NHP pathogen has taken on a new dimension. Unprecedented breaking down of natural barriers between NHP and humans has increased exposure to health risks for a much larger population, including people living in urban areas. There are several reasons for this: (i) due to road development and massive destruction of ecosystems for agricultural needs, wildlife and humans come into contact more frequently; (ii) due to ecological awareness, many long distance travelers are in search of wildlife discovery, with a particular fascination for African great apes; (iii) due to the attraction for ancient temples and mystical practices, others travelers visit Asian places colonized by NHP. In each case, there is a risk of pathogen transmission through a bite or another route of infection. Beside the individual risk of contracting a pathogen, there is also the possibility of starting a new pandemic. This article reviews the known cases of NHP pathogens' transmission to humans whether they are hunters, travelers, ecotourists, veterinarians, or scientists working on NHP. Although pathogen transmission is supposed to be a rare outcome, Rabies virus, Herpes B virus, Monkeypox virus, Ebola virus, or Yellow fever virus infections are of greater concern and require quick countermeasures from public health professionals."

This is important as at the time of writing this manuscript there is an ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo which has killed over 1000. METHODS:We have evaluated a small number of natural products, some of which had shown antiviral activity against other pathogens. This is exemplified with eugenol, which is found in high concentrations in multiple essential oils, and has shown antiviral activity against feline calicivirus, tomato yellow leaf curl virus, Influenza A virus, Herpes Simplex virus type 1 and 2, and four airborne phages. RESULTS:Four compounds possessed EC50 values less than or equal to 11 μM. Of these, eugenol, had an EC50 of 1.3 μM against EBOV and is present in several plants including clove, cinnamon, basil and bay. Eugenol is much smaller and structurally unlike any compound that has been previously identified as an inhibitor of EBOV, therefore it may provide new mechanistic insights. CONCLUSION:This compound is readily accessible in bulk quantities, is inexpensive, and has a long history of human consumption, which endorses the idea for further assessment as an antiviral therapeutic. This work also suggests that a more exhaustive assessment of natural product libraries against EBOV and other viruses is warranted to improve our ability to identify compounds that are so distinct from FDA approved drugs."

CASE PRESENTATION:We examined HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody prevalence among suspected EVD cases from the Sierra Leone-China Friendship Biological Safety Laboratory during the epidemic in Sierra Leone. HIV and HCV antibodies were tested in 678 EVD-negative samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A high HIV prevalence (17.6%) and low HCV prevalence (0.22%) were observed among the suspected cases. Notably, we found decreased HIV positive rates among the suspected cases over the course of the epidemic. This suggests a potentially beneficial effect of an improved public health system after assistance from the World Health Organization and other international aid organizations. CONCLUSIONS:This EVD epidemic had a considerable impact on the public health system and influenced the prevalence of HIV found among suspected cases in Sierra Leone, but also provided an opportunity to establish a better surveillance network for infectious diseases."

Despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. The alternative hypotheses of a non-bat maintenance host or a maintenance community including, or not, several bat and other species, deserves more investigation. However, African forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. How does one puzzle out? Since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. Under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses. In contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts, our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats, and that the alternative maintenance host, if it exists, must be amongst them. A list of these pathways is provided, along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses. In conclusion, taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses.

Heterozygous C-terminal mutations in NFKB2 have been associated with early-onset common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), central adrenal insufficiency and ectodermal dysplasia. Only two previously reported cases have documented decreased natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, and little is known about the role of NF-κB2 in NK cell maturation and function. Here we report a 13-year-old female that presented at 6 years of age with a history of early onset recurrent sinopulmonary infections, progressive hair loss, and hypogamaglobulinemia consistent with a clinical diagnosis of CVID. At 9 years of age she had cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia that responded to ganciclovir treatment. Functional NK cell testing demonstrated decreased NK cell cytotoxicity despite normal NK cell numbers, consistent with a greater susceptibility to systemic CMV infection. Research exome sequencing (ES) was performed and revealed a novel de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in NFKB2 (c.2611C>T, p.Gln871*) that was not carried by either of her parents. The variant was Sanger sequenced and confirmed to be de novo in the patient. At age 12, she presented with a reactivation of the systemic CMV infection that was associated with severe and progressive nephrotic syndrome with histologic evidence of pedicellar effacement and negative immunofluorescence. To our knowledge, this is the third NF-κB2 deficient patient in which an abnormal NK cell function has been observed, suggesting a role for non-canonical NF-κB2 signaling in NK cell cytotoxicity. NK cell function should be assessed in patients with mutations in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway to explore the risk for systemic viral infections that may lead to severe complications and impact patient survival. Similarly NF-κB2 should be considered in patients with combined immunodeficiency who have aberrant NK cell function. Further studies are needed to characterize the role of NF-κB2 in NK cell cytotoxic function."

We aim to describe the natural history of PHACE to enhance clinical management and counseling of patients. METHODS:A cohort of patients ≥ 18 years was identified through the PHACE Syndrome Registry and a Vascular Anomalies Clinic Database. A cross-sectional survey was designed after a review of the literature by PHACE experts (IF, JP, DS). Questions were selected by consensus, and the survey was conducted using the Qualtrics platform and via in-person interviews. A 75% response rate was found. RESULTS:Eighteen adults-17 females and one transgender male-completed the survey. Respondents ranged in age from 18 to 59, with 24 being the mean age. Eighty-nine percent reported experiencing headaches, and 17% reported experiencing acute but transient symptoms mimicking acute ischemic stroke, later diagnosed as atypical migraines. Thirty-three percent reported hearing loss, and 67% endorsed dental issues. One patient experienced two arterial dissections. Three-fourths who attempted conception were successful, and none of their children had clinical features of PHACE. Because results were based on a retrospective survey, data captured were prone to recall bias and not objective. Results were limited by a small sample size. CONCLUSIONS:Health care providers should be aware of a possible increased risk of neurovascular complications, including atypical migraines mimicking transient ischemic attacks and arterial dissection, in adults with PHACE. Heritability has not been demonstrated, and future studies are needed to assess the risk of infertility."

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions."

Clinical sites were selected over a wide geographic range within Latin America and the Caribbean, taking into account the dynamic course of the ZIKV epidemic. METHODS:Recruitment to the PW cohort will take place in antenatal care clinics. PW will be enrolled regardless of symptoms and followed over the course of pregnancy, approximately every 4 weeks. PW will be revisited at delivery (or after miscarriage/abortion) to assess birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities according to the evolving definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). After birth, children will be followed for 2 years in the CH cohort. Follow-up visits are scheduled at ages 1-3, 4-6, 12, and 24 months to assess neurocognitive and developmental milestones. In addition, a NH cohort for the characterization of symptomatic rash/fever illness was designed, including follow-up to capture persisting health problems. Blood, urine, and other biological materials will be collected, and tested for ZIKV and other relevant arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever) using RT-PCR or serological methods. A virtual, decentralized biobank will be created. Reciprocal clinical monitoring has been established between partner sites. Substudies of ZIKV seroprevalence, transmission clustering, disabilities and health economics, viral kinetics, the potential role of antibody enhancement, and co-infections will be linked to the cohort studies. DISCUSSION:Results of these large cohort studies will provide better risk estimates for birth defects and other developmental abnormalities associated with ZIKV infection including possible co-factors for the variability of risk estimates between other countries and regions. Additional outcomes include incidence and transmission estimates of ZIKV during and after pregnancy, characterization of short and long-term clinical course following infection and viral kinetics of ZIKV.

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]"

While adrenarche may be delayed in children with constitutional growth of puberty and in isolated GH deficiency, this does not generally seem to be the case in hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism due to Turner syndrome (TS) and this is (anecdotally) the usual hormonal profile in NS children and adults. Precocious or 'exaggerated' adrenarche can be associated with intrauterine growth retardation and is a forerunner of syndrome X. Although NS neonates often have 'normal' birth weights, in some it can be artificially inflated by subcutaneous edema (as in TS, where intrauterine growth retardation is characteristic). Overall, however, a controlling role for adrenarche (whether precocious or delayed) in gonadarche in NS seems unlikely. Neither normally descended testes nor normal (even if delayed) pubertal development implies normal fertility in NS men. Interactions between fetal, neonatal, childhood and pubertal testis development and gonadal axis maturation are complex. There is probably a spectrum of abnormalities in NS, but most commonly primary gonadal failure and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism - characteristic NS molecular genetic abnormalities - may be important for normal germ cell proliferation, development and migration. The identification of different gene defects facilitates understanding of NS phenotypic diversity and provides opportunities for prospective studies on gonadal and adrenal axes in better defined populations less subject to ascertainment bias. At a clinical level, more longitudinal data are still needed with regard to the natural history of pubertal timing, its tempo of progression and the pattern of pubertal growth."

The incidence, prevalence, and natural history of these conditions remain unquantified, but observations from specialist clinics suggest they are frequently seen in hEDS. There is growing understanding of how hEDS-related physical and physiological pathology contributes to the development of these conditions. Evaluation of cardiovascular symptoms in hEDS should include a careful history and clinical examination. Tests of cardiovascular function range from clinic room observation to tilt-table assessment to other laboratory investigations such as supine and standing catecholamine levels. Non-pharmacologic treatments include education, managing the environment to reduce exposure to triggers, improving cardiovascular fitness, and maintaining hydration. Although there are limited clinical trials, the response to drug treatments in hEDS is supported by evidence from case and cohort observational data, and short-term physiological studies. Pharmacologic therapy is indicated for patients with moderate-severe impairment of daily function and who have inadequate response or tolerance to conservative treatment.

Colonic ruptures are a common feature of the disease, but clear recommendations on their management are lacking. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to identify surgery-related morbidity and 30-day postoperative mortality after colonic perforation. DESIGN:This was a retrospective review. SETTING:A large cohort of patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was followed in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS:Between 2000 and 2016, the French National Reference Centre for Rare Vascular Diseases (HEGP, AP-HP, Paris, France) followed 148 patients with molecularly proven vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:The primary outcomes measured were surgery-related morbidity and 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS:Of 133 patients with molecularly proven vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 30 (22%) had a history of colonic perforation and 15 (50%) were males. These subjects were diagnosed with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome at a younger age than patients with a history of GI events without colonic perforation (p = 0.0007). There were 46 colonic perforations, median 1.0 event per patient (interquartile range, 1.0-2.0). Reperforations occurred in 14 (47%) patients, mostly males. Surgical management consisted of Hartmann procedures or subtotal abdominal colectomies, with a nonnegligible rate of reperforation following partial colonic resection (11 patients, 41%). LIMITATIONS:The main limitations of this work are its retrospective design and that the diagnosis of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was made after colonic perforations in a majority of patients. CONCLUSION:Colonic perforations seem more severe in males, with a high rate of reperforation after Hartmann procedure. Subtotal colectomy may reduce digestive morbidity, particularly in male patients. Additional studies are required to identify other predictors of reperforation.

The genotype influences the distribution of arterial pathology with aneurysms of intra-abdominal visceral arteries being relatively uncommon. We describe the case of a young man with probable VEDS who died of a spontaneous rupture and dissection of the cystic artery. The patient initially presented with abdominal pain due to an unrecognized spontaneous perforation of the small intestine complicated by sepsis. We postulate that inflammatory mediators may have triggered the arterial rupture due to remodeling and weakening of vessel walls. The phenotype of the patient's vascular damage included bilateral spontaneous carotid-cavernous sinus fistulae and dissection with pseudoaneurysm formation of large- and medium-sized arteries, predominantly the abdominal aorta and its branches. The autopsy uncovered a long history of vascular events that may have been asymptomatic. These findings along with a positive family history supported the VEDS diagnosis. Loeys-Dietz, Marfan, and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection syndromes were ruled out based on the absence of arterial tortuosity, eye abnormalities, bone overgrowth, and the distribution of vascular damage among other features. Interestingly, microscopic examination of the hippocampus revealed a focus of neuronal heterotopia, commonly associated with epilepsy; however, the patient had no history of seizures. The natural course of VEDS involves the rupture and dissection of arteries that, if unrecognized, can lead to a rapid death after bleeding into free spaces."

Spontaneous bowel perforation and intra-abdominal organ rupture are common complications of vEDS. Other gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations may occur but have not been extensively characterized. We herein describe the natural history of GI events and surgery-related complications in patients with vEDS. METHODS:A retrospective review of GI events in a large cohort of molecularly proven vEDS patients was conducted, after exclusion of mild forms of the disease. RESULTS:Of 133 patients, 41% had a history of GI manifestations with 112 events, mean 2.0 ± 1.3 events per patient. There was an earlier occurrence of GI events in men (P 0.008). Cumulative incidence was 58% for all patients, higher in men and in patients with splice-site variants. Recurrence of GI events was reported in more than 50% of patients. Colonic perforation was the first digestive event for 47% of patients. Of 85 GI surgeries, 37 (43%) were complicated with 43 events. Nine deaths were reported in this population. CONCLUSIONS:Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is characterized not only by bowel perforation but also by a wide variety of GI complications that occur in close to half (41%) of patients. The pattern of GI fragility seems more severe in males and splice-site variants. Complications of GI surgery are common and are related with tissue fragility/friability."

We reviewed a sub-cohort of children with a diagnosis of non-vascular EDS and explored pain severity and interference via the Brief Pain Inventory, and sleep quality via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Pain severity had a strong correlation with pain interference, and both were similar to other disorders that include chronic pain reported in the literature. Sleep quality did not correlate with pain severity or interference, but all patients had poor sleep quality in comparison to historical controls.

The most recent criteria for the diagnosis of EDS were devised in Villefranche in 1997. [Beighton et al. (1998); Am J Med Genet 77:31-37]. The aims set out in the Villefranche Criteria were: to enable diagnostic uniformity for clinical and research purposes, to understand the natural history of each subtype of EDS, to inform management and genetic counselling, and to identify potential areas of research. The authors recognized that the criteria would need updating, but viewed the Villefranche nosology as a good starting point. Since 1997, there have been major advances in the molecular understanding of classical EDS.

For a group of nine commonly-infected mammals spanning >2 orders of magnitude in body mass, we asked whether life history features or surrogates for (unknown) encounter rates with ticks, predicted reservoir competence for each pathogen. Life history features associated with a fast pace of life generally were positively correlated with reservoir competence. However, a model comparison approach revealed that host population density, as a proxy for encounter rates between hosts and pathogens, generally received more support than did life history features. The specific life history features and the importance of host population density differed somewhat between the different pathogens. We interpret these results as supporting two alternative but non-exclusive hypotheses for why ecologically widespread, synanthropic species are often the most competent reservoirs for multi-host pathogens. First, multi-host pathogens might adapt to those hosts they are most likely to experience, which are likely to be the most abundant and/or frequently bitten by tick vectors. Second, species with fast life histories might allocate less to certain immune defenses, which could increase their reservoir competence. Results suggest that of the host species that might potentially be exposed, those with comparatively high population densities, small bodies, and fast pace of life will often be keystone reservoirs that should be targeted for surveillance or management."

It was thus the first species of what are now known as Ehrlichia to be discovered, and most of the early work to elucidate the nature of the organisms, and its reservoirs and vectors, was performed in South Africa. The next milestone was the development, in 1945, of an infection and treatment regimen to immunize livestock, and this is still the only commercially available ""vaccine"" against the disease.

Tick-borne fever (TBF), which is caused by the prototype of A. phagocytophilum, was first described in 1932 in Scotland.

Until the discovery of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) in the USA in 1994, these organisms were thought to be distinct species of bacteria infecting specific domestic animals and free-living reservoirs. It is now widely accepted that the agents affecting different animal hosts are variants of the same Gram-negative obligatory intracellular bacterium, which is transmitted by hard ticks belonging to the Ixodes persulcatus complex. One of its fascinating features is that it infects and actively grows in neutrophils by employing an array of mechanisms to subvert their bactericidal activity. It is also able to survive within an apparently immune host by employing a complex mechanism of antigenic variation. Ruminants with TBF and humans with HGA develop severe febrile reaction, bacteraemia and leukopenia due to neutropenia, lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia within a week of exposure to a tick bite.

We aimed to investigate the association of ALBI score with natural history of chronic HBV infection and treatment response of CHB patients. METHODS:The ALBI score in a cohort of 849 individuals including 721 chronic HBV-infected patients naïve to anti-HBV treatment in different phases and 128 healthy controls were estimated. Additionally, the dynamic changes of ALBI score of 243 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients treated with pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-α) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) were tested for 72 weeks. RESULTS:ALBI score differed among phases, with the highest score in HBeAg-positive CHB patients, followed by HBeAg-negative CHB patients, HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection, and HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection. Besides, CHB patients harbouring high baseline ALBI score exhibited a relatively stronger therapeutic response to PEG-IFN-α or NAs. Moreover, the rate of HBeAg and HBsAg loss in patients with ALBI grade 2 was persistently higher than that in patients with ALBI grade 1 throughout the course of treatment. Furthermore, ALBI score was an independent predictor of sustained response achievement. The combined use of ALBI score, HBeAg and ALT could enhance the predictive value of treatment response. CONCLUSIONS:ALBI score differed significantly across the natural course of chronic HBV infection and was correlated with PEG-IFN-α and NAs treatment response in HBeAg-positive CHB patients, which suggested that ALBI score could be useful as an auxiliary clinical factor to determine the initiation of therapy and predict stronger antiviral treatment response."

In the present study, I propose that heritable intraspecific variation in prey, which facilitates natural selection, is a key to solve this issue. A mathematical model reveals that diverse genotypes in a prey promote the coexistence of multiple predator species. When two predators share a prey with multiple genotypes, evolution nearly selects the two prey genotypes. Through analysis, I establish a condition of coexistence of such multiple predator-one prey interaction with two genotypes. If each prey type has high defensive capacity against different predator species, stable coexistence is likely to occur. Particularly, interspecific variations of life-history parameters allow the coexistence equilibrium to be stable. In addition, rapid evolution in a prey allows more than two predator species to coexist. Furthermore, mutation tends to stabilize otherwise unstable systems. These results suggest that intraspecific variation in a prey plays a key role in the maintenance of diverse predator species by driving adaptive evolution."

Sampling-species relationships (SSRs) are interrelated yet separate drivers for species richness estimates. Traditionally, however, SAR and SSR models have been used independently and not incorporated into a single approach. We developed and compared predictive models that incorporate sampling effort species-area relationships (SESARS) along the entire Atlantic Forest of South America, and then applied the best-fit model to estimate richness in forest remnants of Interior Atlantic Forest of eastern Paraguay. This framework was applied to non-volant small mammal assemblages that reflect different tolerances to forest loss and fragmentation. In order to account for differences in functionality we estimated small mammal richness of 1) the entire non-volant small mammal assemblage, including introduced species; 2) the native species forest assemblage; and 3) the forest-specialist assemblage, with the latter two assemblages being subsets of the entire assemblage. Finally, we geospatially modeled species richness for each of the three assemblages throughout eastern Paraguay to identify remnants with high species richness. We found that multiple regression power-law interaction-term models that only included area and the interactions of area and sampling as predictors, worked best for predicting species richness for the entire assemblage and the native species forest assemblage, while several traditional SAR models (logistic, power, exponential, and ratio) best described forest-specialist richness. Species richness was significantly different between assemblages. We identified obvious remnants with high species richness in eastern Paraguay, and these remnants often were geographically isolated. We also found relatively high predicted species richness (in relation to the entire range of predicted richness values) in several geographically-isolated, medium-size forest remnants that likely have not been considered as possible priority areas for conservation. These findings highlight the importance of using an empirical dataset, created using sources representing diverse sampling efforts, to develop robust predictive models. This approach is particularly important in geographic locations where field sampling is limited yet the geographic area is experiencing rapid and dramatic land cover changes. When combined, area and sampling are powerful modeling predictors for questions of biogeography, ecology, and conservation, especially when addressing habitat loss and fragmentation."

However, their use is subject to a number of challenges, principally the identification of taxa within the images without associated physical specimens. The challenge of applying traditional taxonomic keys to the identification of fauna from images has led to the development of personal, group, or institution level reference image catalogues of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or morphospecies. Lack of standardisation among these reference catalogues has led to problems with observer bias and the inability to combine datasets across studies. In addition, lack of a common reference standard is stifling efforts in the application of artificial intelligence to taxon identification. Using the North Atlantic deep sea as a case study, we propose a database structure to facilitate standardisation of morphospecies image catalogues between research groups and support future use in multiple front-end applications. We also propose a framework for coordination of international efforts to develop reference guides for the identification of marine species from images. The proposed structure maps to the Darwin Core standard to allow integration with existing databases. We suggest a management framework where high-level taxonomic groups are curated by a regional team, consisting of both end users and taxonomic experts. We identify a mechanism by which overall quality of data within a common reference guide could be raised over the next decade. Finally, we discuss the role of a common reference standard in advancing marine ecology and supporting sustainable use of this ecosystem."

METHODS: All patients diagnosed antenatally with cystic lung malformations from 2001 to 2011, at a tertiary referral paediatric surgical centre practising a policy of conservative management of asymptomatic cases, were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected from medical case notes and radiology reports. Ethical approval was obtained from our institutional research and development department. RESULTS: The complete records of 74 fetuses antenatally diagnosed with CLM were reviewed. There were 72 live births, at a median gestation of 39.6 weeks. Emergency lobectomy was performed in one symptomatic neonate. Elective lobectomies were performed at parental request in three asymptomatic infants, one of whom had a family history of synovial sarcoma. Two patients developed pneumonia in the affected lobe during early childhood and proceeded to lobectomy at the age of 3 years. One patient with a bronchopulmonary sequestration required embolisation for cyanotic episodes. The remaining 65 patients have been conservatively managed to date, and none have required hospital admission. Less than a quarter report mild respiratory symptoms such as cough or wheeze. Median follow-up is 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective cohort study of 74 consecutive CLMs diagnosed antenatally over a 10-year period demonstrates that most of these lesions will remain asymptomatic throughout childhood. Although the natural history of CLMs in later years remains to be elucidated, we hope that this report on medium-term outcomes will be useful to clinicians who undertake antenatal counselling and may inform the discussion on how best to manage these children."

This review aims at the description of their natural history, and of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. STATE OF THE ART: Congenital lung lesions are frequently diagnosed antenatally and many remain asymptomatic after birth. In the absence of antenatal identification, they are usually revealed by the occurrence of infection. In some cases, spontaneous resolution of the malformation can occur. Different pathogenic hypotheses are discussed for the origin of these abnormalities, and common processes appear likely to all of these malformations. Factors involved in the process of branching seem to play a particularly important role. PERSPECTIVES: Prospective follow-up of operated and unoperated children would complete our knowledge about the natural history of these lesions. The contribution of experimental models has led to advances in the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. Further studies are needed to identify the factors initiating the malformative process."

It has repeatedly been discussed as a localised form of Proteus syndrome. In 2006, the first large series of patients was reported, and diagnostic criteria were proposed. AIMS: To better define the phenotypic spectrum and natural history of ECCL and to revise diagnostic criteria. METHODS: 54 patients with ECCL were reviewed. RESULTS: Eye anomalies (mainly choristomas) and skin lesions (non-scarring alopecia, naevus psiloliparus, subcutaneous fatty masses, nodular skin tags, aplastic scalp defects) may be unilateral or bilateral and occur in a consistent pattern. Central nervous system anomalies consist of intracranial and intraspinal lipomas, congenital abnormalities of the meninges, and putative focal vascular defects resulting in highly asymmetrical changes. About two-thirds of patients have a normal development or mild retardation only, and half of them have seizures. No correlation between the extent of central nervous system anomalies and neurological features could be established. Aortic coarctation, progressive bone cysts and jaw tumours may be associated. CONCLUSIONS: Revised diagnostic criteria are proposed. ECCL is considered to differ from Proteus syndrome in particular, but oculoectodermal syndrome is possibly a mild variant. Pathogenetically, mosaicism for a mutated autosomal gene involved in multiple mesenchymal tumours and vasculogenesis, with or without a second hit event, is discussed."

The gestational age at diagnosis ranged from 24 to 40 weeks of gestation (average 33.4 weeks). All were diagnosed by ultrasonography, and either MRI or whole body CT was additionally performed to evaluate the morphology in ten patients. MRI was a definitely useful diagnostic tool to evaluate the intracranial morphology, whereas whole body CT was much superior to other diagnostic imagings to visualize the condition of cranium or cranial sutures. Using these diagnostic procedures the type of hydrocephalus, was able to be identified, according to the major categories, in the individual cases. Spine morphology, however, was not detected n such high quality by MRI. Ultrasonography combined with application of whole body CT, with or without MRI, may be the best method now available to diagnose spina bifida.

We developed a novel severity scoring system designed to quantify FCA progression and correlate with clinical outcomes. Methods- The VIPS study (Vascular Effects of Infection in Pediatric Stroke) prospectively enrolled 355 children with arterial ischemic stroke (2010-2014), including 41 with centrally confirmed FCA. Two neuroradiologists independently reviewed FCA cerebrovascular imaging, assigning a graded severity score of zero (no involvement) to 4 (occlusion) to individual arterial segments. The FCA severity score (FCASS) was the unweighted sum. In an iterative process, we modeled scores derived from different combinations of arterial segments to identify the model that optimized correlation with clinical outcome, simplicity, and reliability. Results- The optimal FCASS summed scores from 5 arterial segments: supraclinoid internal carotid artery, A1, A2, M1, and M2. The median (interquartile range) baseline FCASS was 4 (2-6).

Twenty-four (73%) had FCA progression on follow-up with their maximum FCASS at a median of 8 (5-35.5) days poststroke; their median FCASS increase was 4 (2.5-6). FCASS did not correlate with recurrent arterial ischemic stroke. Maximum (but not baseline) FCASS correlated with 1-year pediatric stroke outcome measures ( P=0.037).

MKD is characterized by recurrent febrile attacks that are frequently accompanied by lymphadenopathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgia, myalgia, skin rash, and aphthous ulcers. Patients with MVA also have intrauterine growth retardation, congenital defects (cataracts, shortened limbs, and dysmorphic craniofacial features), neurological disease, and failure to thrive. Mean age at onset of symptoms is within the first year of life. There is a delay by several years between symptom onset and diagnosis, which is in part attributable to the initial misdiagnosis due to the rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations of disease. The frequency of recurrent febrile attacks is highest in childhood and gradually decreases after adolescence. MKD is associated with rare long-term complications such as type AA amyloidosis, joint contractures, abdominal adhesions, renal angiomyolipoma, and severe pneumococcal infections.

Scoliosis was found more frequently in patients with onset of Pompe symptoms as children (57.0%) and juveniles (52.9%) than in patients with onset of symptoms as adults (24.8%). Only 18.4% (38/206) of patients with onset of symptoms as infants were reported as having scoliosis. Scoliosis was reported in the majority (62.5%) of wheelchair users for all age groups. A larger percentage of patients with scoliosis required respiratory support than patients without scoliosis (44% vs 27.2%, respectively), and pulmonary function in those with scoliosis was consistently reduced in the 3 older age groups compared to those without scoliosis, with the largest differences demonstrated in juveniles. Patients with scoliosis had been diagnosed with Pompe disease for a mean of 1.2 (±14.34) years before the first reporting of scoliosis. As with other registry analyses, data were collected from multiple sites in different countries and assessments of scoliosis therefore may not be based on consistent criteria. However, the observed occurrence of scoliosis across all age groups of patients with Pompe disease and its association with increased clinical morbidity, underscores the need for clinical assessment of scoliosis in all patients with Pompe disease."

The X-linked nature of inheritance accounts for reported differences in phenotypic severity between men and women. The rarity of Danon disease has limited understanding of the complete phenotype. Clinical estimates of ages of disease onset and survival based on gender have not been published. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present data on 82 patients with Danon disease from 36 families, the largest series to date. Men were severely affected with cognitive disabilities (100%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (88%), and muscle weakness (80%). Men had a high morbidity and were unlikely to reach the age of 25 years without a cardiac transplantation. Women were less severely affected but reported higher than expected levels of cognitive (47%) and skeletal muscle complaints (50%) and manifesting an equal prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Combining our data with that of 63 other Danon disease case reports in the literature, the average ages of first symptom, cardiac transplantation, and death were 12.1, 17.9, and 19.0 years in men and 27.9, 33.7, and 34.6 years in women, respectively. CONCLUSION: These data more broadly illuminate the Danon disease phenotype and should prove useful to physicians working with and providing genetic counseling to families with Danon disease. Women with Danon disease present with clinical symptoms and events approximately 15 years after men and report a higher proportion of cognitive and skeletal muscle problems than previously recognized."

Records from 56 individuals were reviewed and demonstrated fractures, scoliosis, and non-congenital hypophosphatemia that in some cases were resolved. Phosphate and calcitriol, but not skin lesion removal, were effective at controlling hypophosphatemia. No skeletal malignancies were found. PURPOSE:CSHS is a disorder defined by the association of epidermal and/or melanocytic nevi, a mosaic skeletal dysplasia, and an FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia. To date, somatic RAS mutations have been identified in all patients whose affected tissue has undergone DNA sequencing. However, the clinical spectrum and treatment are poorly defined in CSHS. The purpose of this study is to determine the spectrum of the phenotype, natural history of the disease, and response to treatment of hypophosphatemia. METHODS:Five CSHS subjects underwent prospective data collection at clinical research centers. A review of the literature identified 45 reports that included a total of 51 additional patients, in whom the findings were compatible with CSHS. Data on nevi subtypes, bone histology, mineral and skeletal disorders, abnormalities in other tissues, and response to treatment of hypophosphatemia were analyzed. RESULTS:Fractures, limb deformities, and scoliosis affected most CSHS subjects. Hypophosphatemia was not present at birth. Histology revealed severe osteomalacia but no other abnormalities. Skeletal dysplasia was reported in all anatomical compartments, though less frequently in the spine; there was no clear correlation between the location of nevi and the skeletal lesions. Phosphate and calcitriol supplementation was the most effective therapy for rickets. Convincing data that nevi removal improved blood phosphate levels was lacking. An age-dependent improvement in mineral abnormalities was observed. A spectrum of extra-osseous/extra-cutaneous manifestations that included both benign and malignant neoplasms was present in many subjects, though osteosarcoma remains unreported. CONCLUSION:An understanding of the spectrum, natural history, and efficacy of treatment of hypophosphatemia in CSHS may improve the care of these patients."

METHODS:A retrospective study was conducted of 200 children, 157 with recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB) and 43 with junctional EB (JEB)-generalized intermediate, followed at the main referral centre in Germany. Growth charts were calculated using the modified LMS method and were correlated with parameters of anaemia, nutrition, inflammation and the molecular defect in a linear model. RESULTS:In our cohort of patients with RDEB, weight impairment started at 12-18 months old; by the age of 10 years, 50% showed wasting. The predicted median weight at age 20 years was 35·2 kg for men and 40·1 kg for women. In JEB, growth resembled that of healthy children. Anaemia was present from the second year of life onwards in RDEB and JEB. Low levels of haemoglobin, iron, vitamin D, zinc and albumin, high levels of C-reactive protein, and absence of collagen VII correlated significantly with low weight in RDEB. No correlation was observed in JEB. CONCLUSIONS:The results highlight that nutritional compromise occurs early in children with RDEB and therefore may require interventions as of the first year or two of life. What's already known about this topic? Children with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) suffer from failure to thrive and anaemia as major extracutaneous complications. The course of growth and the development of anaemia in EB are poorly characterized. What does this study add? A molecularly well characterized cohort of 200 children with EB was followed with regard to anthropometrics, anaemia and inflammation. We demonstrate early onset of growth failure and anaemia, most pronounced in the subset of recessive dystrophic EB. Awareness of early growth delay and nutritional deficiencies will improve EB care in daily practice."

This was a retrospective review of pathology reports from infants younger < 1 year old with suspected EB primarily analyzed with IFM by the Stanford Dermatopathology service. Seventy-seven cases were identified for analysis, of which 20 were suboptimal for IFM analysis. Fifty-five cases were diagnosed with EB and classified as follows: EB simplex (n = 5), junctional EB (n = 31), dystrophic EB (n = 19). TEM was available in 36 of 55 cases (65%).

Machine-learning methods based on spoken language can detect suicidality in adults. This study's purpose was to use spoken words to create machine-learning classifiers that identify current or lifetime history of comorbid psychiatric conditions in teenagers and young adults with epilepsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Eligible participants were >12 years old with epilepsy. All participants were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) or the MINI Kid Tracking and asked five open-ended conversational questions. N-grams and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) word categories were used to construct machine learning classification models from language harvested from interviews. Data were analyzed for four individual MINI identified disorders and for three mutually exclusive groups: participants with no psychiatric disorders, participants with non-suicidal psychiatric disorders, and participants with any degree of suicidality. Performance was measured using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROCs). RESULTS:Classifiers were constructed from 227 interviews with 122 participants (7.5 ± 3.1 minutes and 454 ± 299 words). AROCs for models differentiating the non-overlapping groups and individual disorders ranged 57%-78% (many with P < .02). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:Machine-learning classifiers of spoken language can reliably identify current or lifetime history of suicidality and depression in people with epilepsy. Data suggest identification of anxiety and bipolar disorders may be achieved with larger data sets. Machine-learning analysis of spoken language can be promising as a useful screening alternative when traditional approaches are unwieldy (eg, telephone calls, primary care offices, school health clinics)."

However, orphan drug development is of increasing interest because of the legislation enabling facilitated support by regulatory agencies through scientific advice, and the protection of the molecules with orphan designation. In the landscape of the rare epilepsies, very few syndromes, namely Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome, have been subject to orphan drug development. Despite orphan designations for rare epilepsies having dramatically increased in the past 10 years, the number of approved drugs remains limited and restricted to a handful of epilepsy syndromes. In this paper, we describe the current state of orphan drug development for rare epilepsies. We identified a large number of compounds currently under investigation, but mostly in the same rare epilepsy syndromes as in the past. A rationale for further development in rare epilepsies could be based on the match between the drug mechanisms of action and the knowledge of the causative gene mutation or by evidence from animal models. In case of the absence of strong pathophysiological hypotheses, exploratory/basket clinical studies could be helpful to identify a subpopulation that may benefit from the new drug. We provide some suggestions for future improvements in orphan drug development such as promoting paediatric drug investigations, better evaluation of the incidence and the prevalence, together with the natural history data, and the development of new primary outcomes."

Patients with NF1 are at increased risk for central nervous system (CNS) manifestations including structural, functional, and neoplastic disease. The mechanisms underlying the varied manifestations of NF1 are incompletely understood, but the loss of functional neurofibromin, resulting in sustained activation of the oncoprotein RAS, is responsible for tumorigenesis throughout the body, including the CNS. Much of our understanding of NF1-related CNS manifestations is from a combination of data from animal models and natural history studies of people with NF1 and CNS disease. Data from animal models suggest the importance of both Nf1 mutations and somatic genetic alterations, such as Tp53 loss, for development of neoplasms, as well as the role of the timing of the acquisition of such alterations on the variability of CNS manifestations. A variety of non-neoplastic structural (macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, aqueductal stenosis, and vasculopathy) and functional (epilepsy, impaired cognition, attention deficits, and autism spectrum disorder) abnormalities occur with variable frequency in individuals with NF1. In addition, there is increasing evidence that similar appearing CNS neoplasms in people with and without the NF1 syndrome are due to distinct oncogenic pathways. Gliomas in people with NF1 show alterations in the RAS/MAPK pathway, generally in the absence of BRAF alterations (common to sporadic pilocytic astrocytomas) or IDH or histone H3 mutations (common to diffuse gliomas subsets). A subset of low-grade astrocytomas in these patients remain difficult to classify using standard criteria, and occasionally demonstrate morphologic features resembling subependymal giant cell astrocytomas that afflict patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (""SEGA-like astrocytomas""). There is also emerging evidence that NF1-associated high-grade astrocytomas have frequent co-existing alterations such as ATRX mutations and an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype responsible for unique biologic properties. Ongoing efforts are seeking to improve diagnostic accuracy for CNS neoplasms in the setting of NF1 versus sporadic tumors. In addition, MEK inhibitors, which act on the RAS/MAPK pathway, continue to be studied as rational targets for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors, including CNS tumors."

Its mortality is secondary to sudden and spontaneous rupture of arteries or hollow organs. The genotype influences the distribution of arterial pathology with aneurysms of intra-abdominal visceral arteries being relatively uncommon. We describe the case of a young man with probable VEDS who died of a spontaneous rupture and dissection of the cystic artery. The patient initially presented with abdominal pain due to an unrecognized spontaneous perforation of the small intestine complicated by sepsis. We postulate that inflammatory mediators may have triggered the arterial rupture due to remodeling and weakening of vessel walls. The phenotype of the patient's vascular damage included bilateral spontaneous carotid-cavernous sinus fistulae and dissection with pseudoaneurysm formation of large- and medium-sized arteries, predominantly the abdominal aorta and its branches. The autopsy uncovered a long history of vascular events that may have been asymptomatic. These findings along with a positive family history supported the VEDS diagnosis. Loeys-Dietz, Marfan, and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection syndromes were ruled out based on the absence of arterial tortuosity, eye abnormalities, bone overgrowth, and the distribution of vascular damage among other features. Interestingly, microscopic examination of the hippocampus revealed a focus of neuronal heterotopia, commonly associated with epilepsy; however, the patient had no history of seizures. The natural course of VEDS involves the rupture and dissection of arteries that, if unrecognized, can lead to a rapid death after bleeding into free spaces."

The study used several statistical methods tailored to address the age at onset of various forms of G1D, associated manifestations, natural history, treatment efficacy, and diagnostic procedures. These factors were correlated in a predictive mathematical model designed to guide prognosis on the basis of clinical features present at diagnosis. Results:A total of 181 patients with G1D were included in the study (92 [50.8%] male and 89 female [49.2%]; median age, 9 years; age range, 0-65 years). As previously known, a relatively large variety of common phenotypes are characteristic of the G1D syndrome, including movement disorders, absence epilepsy (typical and atypical), and myoclonic and generalized epilepsies. The 3 main novel results are (1) the feasibility of effective dietary therapies (such as the modified Atkins diet) other than the ketogenic diet, (2) the relatively frequent occurrence (one-fourth of cases) of white matter magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, and (3) the favorable effect of early diagnosis and treatment regardless of treatment modality and mutation type. In fact, the most important factor that determines outcome is age at diagnosis, as reflected in a predictive mathematical model.

The average change in spike rate between recordings at baseline and at 6 months was a decrease of 64.7% (range -100% to +51.5%, p = 0.01) and the average change in rate between recordings at baseline and at 12 months was a decrease of 57.7% (range -100% to +29.1%, p = 0.01). In addition, within 6 months, most children had decreased centrotemporal rates, with 30% of children being spike-free. This absence of spikes did not continue in all children, since the majority (60%) had some spikes at 1 year following diagnosis.Centrotemporal spike rates during sleep are stable when compared over days to weeks; however, when comparing spike rates over months there is a larger degree of variability."

METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study of 103 individuals from 17 FMTLE families (mean follow-up: 7.6 years). We divided subjects into 3 groups: FMTLE (n = 53), unclassified seizure (n = 18), and asymptomatics (n = 32). We divided FMTLE patients into 3 subgroups: seizure-free (n = 19), infrequent (n = 17) seizures, and frequent (n = 17) seizures and further reclassified them into favorable and poor outcome. We defined hippocampal atrophy (HA) by visual MRI analysis and performed volumetry in those who had 2 MRIs. RESULTS: FMTLE patients with infrequent seizures evolved to either frequent seizures (17.6%) or seizure freedom (23.5%). In the seizure-free group, most remained seizure-free and 21% developed infrequent seizures. All patients with frequent seizures remained in the same status or underwent surgery. Twelve percent of the asymptomatics and 22% of the unclassified-seizure group evolved to FMTLE with infrequent seizures. Predictive factors of poor outcome were presence of HA (p = 0.0192) and interictal epileptiform discharges (p = 0.0174). The relationship between initial precipitating incidents and clinical outcome was not significant although a tendency was observed (p = 0.055). Use of antiepileptic drugs and secondary generalized seizures during the patient's lifetime did not predict poor outcome. We observed progression of HA only in the group with frequent seizures. CONCLUSION: Most patients with FMTLE continued in the same clinical status. However, patients with frequent seizures had progression of HA and none improved except those who underwent surgery. Interictal epileptiform discharges and HA predicted poorer outcome in FMTLE, and there was a tendency in favor of initial precipitating incidents as outcome predictors."

Acute management includes the treatment and differential diagnosis of FS and depend on the presence of seizures and a patient's level of consciousness upon arrival at hospital: a patient may be discharged after physical examination if there are no seizures and no alteration of consciousness; close observation and laboratory examinations may be indicated in cases when there are no seizures but the patient exhibits altered consciousness; and intravenous diazepam (DZP) is indicated if seizures persist. Central nervous system infections should be ruled out: if the patient has signs of meningeal irritation or increased intracranial pressure, disturbed consciousness for >1h, atypical seizures (partial seizures, seizures for >15 min, or recurrent seizures within 24h), cerebrospinal fluid examinations and/or computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging are warranted. Chronic management includes the prevention of recurrent FS, counseling parents, and vaccination. Japanese guideline for the prevention of recurrent FS defines two types of warning factors (WF) for selecting patients who should be monitored carefully: factors related to the onset of epilepsy (EP factors) and recurrence of FS (FS factors). The EP factors consist of neurological or developmental abnormalities prior to the onset of FS, atypical seizures, and history of epilepsy in parents or siblings. The FS factors include the onset of FS before 1 year of age and a history of FS in one or both parents. The guideline recommends no medication for children with two or fewer past episodes of FS without WF; prophylactic DZP for children with prolonged FS exceeding 15 min, or two or more episodes of FS with two or more WF; and daily administration of phenobarbital or valproate for children in whom FS occur under 38 degrees C or who have prolonged FS despite prophylactic DZP. To reduce parents' anxiety, the natural history of FS should be explained. A child can be given all current vaccinations 2-3 months after the last episode of FS by his/her family doctor with information provided to the parents as to how to cope with fever and convulsions."

Enhanced bone resorption is a recurrent histological feature of FD and a major cause of fragility of affected bones. Previous work suggests that increased bone resorption in FD is driven by RANKL and some studies have shown that the anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody, denosumab, reduces bone turnover and bone pain in FD patients. However, the effect of RANKL inhibition on the histopathology of FD and its impact on the natural history of the disease remain to be assessed. In this study, we treated the EF1α-Gs αR201C mice, which develop an FD-like phenotype, with an anti-mouse RANKL monoclonal antibody. We found that the treatment induced marked radiographic and microscopic changes at affected skeletal sites in 2-month-old mice. The involved skeletal segments became sclerotic due to the deposition of new, highly mineralized bone within developing FD lesions and showed a higher mechanical resistance compared to affected segments from untreated transgenic mice. Similar changes were also detected in older mice with a full-blown skeletal phenotype. The administration of anti-mouse RANKL antibody arrested the growth of established lesions and, in young mice, prevented the appearance of new ones. However, after drug withdrawal, the newly formed bone was remodelled into FD tissue and the disease progression resumed in young mice. Taken together, our results show that the anti-RANKL antibody significantly affected the bone pathology and natural history of FD in the mouse. Pending further work on the prevention and management of relapse after treatment discontinuation, our preclinical study suggests that RANKL inhibition may be an effective therapeutic option for FD patients. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research."

METHODS:A PubMed search was undertaken to evaluate recent SCFE literature. A convenience sample of articles were selected and summarized. RESULTS:Most slips appear well tolerated long-term with ∼5% resulting in total hip arthroplasty (THA) at 20-year follow-up. Classic data reveals poor outcomes following closed reduction for treatment of SCFE. Improvements in intraoperative fluoroscopy and avoidance of pin penetration have reduced the rates of chondrolysis. Unfortunately, avascular necrosis remains a known risk in patients, occurring in 15% to 50% of patients following acute, unstable slips. This is the most common cause of THA in patients with SCFE. Rate of THA due to degenerative arthritis secondary to SCFE is more difficult to determine and occurs at a later age. Although realignment procedures to address anatomic abnormalities from SCFE have increased in popularity, it is unclear if this prevents degenerative arthritis and subsequently reduces the rate of THA. SCFE patients face an increased risk of disability and death due to their underlying medical comorbidities. Interventions for weight loss, blood pressure management, and lifestyle adjustments should be considered at the time of SCFE diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:SCFE remains a challenging and common condition for pediatric orthopedists. Although innovative techniques have been proposed, long-term outcome data still supports in situ pinning for stable slips, and in situ pinning with capsular decompression for unstable slips to minimize the risk of avascular necrosis."

Concerningly, case reports have described poor skeletal outcomes associated with pregnancy in women with fibrous dysplasia. METHODS:Thirty-nine women with fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome were evaluated as part of a natural history study. Clinical, radiographic, and biochemical data were reviewed. Women were contacted to obtain detailed menstrual and reproductive histories. RESULTS:Abnormal uterine bleeding affected 77% of women (30/39), and was associated with severe anemia requiring blood transfusion in 3 cases. Nine women underwent hysterectomy for management of bleeding, including 67% (6/9) at the unusually young age of less than age 35 years.

Objectives:To expand the range of approaches available to assist in the identification of AZOOR by multimodal imaging and to analyze the fundus lesions by quantifying short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (quantitative fundus autofluorescence [qAF]) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Design, Setting, and Participants:In this observational study, patients underwent imaging at Columbia University Medical Center between November 2010 and March 2016 and were analyzed between September 2015 and August 2016. Six patients diagnosed as having AZOOR were studied by qAF and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and were compared with 30 age and race/ethnicity–matched controls from a database of 277 healthy control eyes. Main Outcomes and Measures:In unaffected regions of the macula, qAF was calculated within predetermined circularly arranged segments (qAF8). In addition, qAF was measured within specified regions of interest positioned at the autofluorescent lesion border (AZOOR line). Electroretinograms and electro-oculograms were recorded in 5 of 6 patients. Results:Among 6 patients (age range, 26-61 years; 4 female; 4 of white race/ethnicity, 1 Asian, and 1 Hispanic), 5 exhibited an autofluorescent AZOOR line in short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence images, delineating the peripapillary lesion. The mean (SD) region-of-interest qAF measured on the AZOOR line was 60 (26) times higher than in healthy control eyes (P = .03) at equivalent fundus locations. The qAF8 within nondiseased macular regions were within the normal range. At the lesion border, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed a loss of outer retinal integrity in all patients. Single-flash cone b-wave latency and 30-Hz flicker latency responses were significantly delayed bilaterally. Lesions with smooth, homogeneous borders exhibited only minimal expansion in size over time, while the lesion in a patient with a heterogeneous border progressed more rapidly. Conclusions and Relevance:The finding that qAF is elevated at the border between diseased and nondiseased retina in patients with AZOOR contributes to the understanding of the natural history of the disease."

Fourteen patients underwent treatment of choice including craniofacial resection (CFR) with or without radiotherapy (XRT). Six patients could only receive less extensive treatment; three patients underwent lateral rhinotomy (LR) with or without XRT after being deemed medically unsuitable for CFR, while another three patients received only supportive, non-surgical treatment (due to positive lymph node status in two and to extensive tumor size in one case).

No reports on neuroradiological follow-up of EE patients are available in the literature with which to compare our data. Finally, both patients showed a muscle COX deficiency. The pathogenetic implications of such a biochemical finding will be also discussed."

The early descriptions of the Chiari malformations by Hans Chiari in 1891 opened the door for future classification and research on this topic. However, even over a long timeframe, our understanding of the pathophysiology and, more importantly, treatment, remained in its infancy. As recently as the 1970s, CIM was not discussed in popular neurology textbooks. Syringomyelia is listed as a degenerative disorder with no satisfactory treatment. Radiation therapy was considered an option in treatment, and surgery was thought to play no role. During the last 40 years, equivalent to the duration of a neurosurgical career, our understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CIM, coupled with modern MRI, has improved the treatment paradigm for this patient population. More importantly, it has given us evidence confirming that CIM is a disorder responsive to surgical intervention, giving patients once thought to be destined for lifelong disability a comparatively normal life after treatment. The purpose of this article is to offer a review of CIM and its important associated entities. The authors will discuss the evolution in understanding of the Chiari malformation and, importantly, distinguish between symptomatic CIM and asymptomatic tonsillar ectopia, based on imaging and presenting symptomatology. They will discuss techniques for surgical intervention, expected outcomes, and complications after surgery. Proper patient selection for surgery based on appropriate symptomatology is tantamount to achieving good surgical outcomes in this population, separating those who can be helped by surgery from those who are unlikely to improve. While our knowledge of the Chiari malformations continues to improve through the efforts of clinical and basic science researchers, surgeons, and patients, our current understanding of these entities represents a monumental improvement in patient care over a relatively short time period."

However, sudden neurological deterioration is a rare and severe event. Herein, we report rare occurrences of sudden clinical deterioration in two previously asymptomatic children harbouring intradural LLs without dermal sinus tracts or signs of occult dysraphism. A review of the pertinent literature is also included. CASE PRESENTATION:One child exhibited acute deterioration because of an epidural abscess associated with a filar lipoma without a sinus tract (probably caused by haematogenous spreading from a respiratory tract multiple infection), and the other child exhibited acute deterioration because of a very large, holocord syringomyelia-like cyst associated with a small conus lipoma. Both patients were 4 years old. In case #2, a previously undetected, severe tethered cord (conus at the S3-S4 level) was also present. A complete recovery was attained after an urgent surgical operation in both cases (in addition to targeted antibiotic therapy in case #1). All cases of deterioration in the literature were caused by abscess formation in dermal sinus tracts. CONCLUSIONS:Prophylactic surgery may be indicated even in asymptomatic children that have tethered cord and surgically favourable LLs (small dorsal and filar LLs), especially if the conditions are associated with progressive syringomyelia. Similarly, intradural dermal sinus tracts should be regarded as surgery-indicated, even if the conus is in its normal position and the patient is asymptomatic because there is a consistent risk of severe, infection-related complications. Finally, asymptomatic patients with filar LLs and a normally located conus can be candidates for surgery or an accurate clinical and radiological follow-up."

Only a few cases of adults with spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia associated with Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) have been reported. The timing of surgical intervention for syringomyelia remains controversial. The present report has documented a case with the longest medical history of syringomyelia reported, the associated imaging findings over 16 years, the mild symptom progression after the spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia, and a review of the relevant reported data. The natural history of our patient provides a unique view regarding the factors that might lead to the development and spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia. CASE DESCRIPTION:We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who had been monitored for 16 years for mild symptomatic CM-I and syringomyelia. After regular follow-up examinations for the initial 10 years, magnetic resonance imaging revealed partial spontaneous resolution of the syringomyelia and unchanged symptoms. However, after 6 additional years of follow-up examinations, her symptoms had mildly progressed, and the size of the syringomyelia had obviously decreased. CONCLUSIONS:The findings from our patient suggest that the natural course of mild symptomatic CM-I in adult patients will be benign and nonprogressive. Patients will commonly present with very few or mild symptoms, despite the presence of a large syrinx. It would be reasonable to observe patients with similar mild symptoms and syringomyelia. Surgery will be indicated by the type, severity, and duration of symptoms at the first clinical visit. Periodic follow-up examinations are also essential after spontaneous resolution because the pathophysiology of syringomyelia is incompletely understood and recurrence possible."

SUMMARY ANSWER:Maternal periconceptional no folic acid supplementation can increase the risk of NTDs associated with previous spontaneous abortion or first-trimester fever, independent of known confounding factors. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY:Maternal periconceptional folic acid deficiency can increase the risk of NTDs. However, whether an interaction between periconceptional no folic acid supplementation and history of spontaneous abortion or first-trimester fever may have an increased risk of NTDs remains unknown. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION:A population-based case-control study was performed including 104 nuclear families with offspring with NTDs and 100 control families with normal offspring between 1993 and 2002. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS:We investigated the potential interaction between periconceptional no folic acid use and a maternal history of spontaneous abortion or first-trimester fever in the risk for NTDs. Information on exposure factors was obtained at the onset of pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes were collected during the first week after delivery or at the time of termination of the pregnancy. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE:The interaction between periconceptional no folic acid use and a maternal history of spontaneous abortion markedly increased the risk of NTDs (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 18.68, 95% CI, 4.43-78.76) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The interaction coefficient was found to be 2.08, higher than 1, indicating that there is a significant interaction between two factors. Mothers who did not take periconceptional folic acid and had first-trimester fever had an increased risk of NTDs (aOR 21.81, 95% CI, 8.81-80.73). However, the interaction coefficient was found to be 0.62, less than 1, indicating that there is no significant interaction between two factors. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION:A potential limitation was that the interval between the previous spontaneous abortion and the beginning of the subsequent pregnancy could not be estimated accurately, but was at least 1 year or more. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS:We emphasize that a previous spontaneous abortion may represent a first occurrence of NTDs rather than be the cause of NTDs. Our findings indicate that mothers with a history of spontaneous abortion are ideal candidates for periconceptional folic acid supplementation.

Neurologic injury associated with MMC begins with abnormal neurulation and is perpetuated by subsequent traumatic and toxic injury sustained in utero. Treatment historically has involved surgical closure of the MMC after birth along with neonatal management of the associated sequelae including cerebrospinal fluid diversion by ventricular shunting. With improvements in prenatal diagnosis, a defined antenatal natural history, and the concept of fetal intervention to arrest or reverse ongoing in utero damage, maternal-fetal surgery for MMC closure developed as a feasible therapy. Animal studies and early human studies investigating in utero MMC closure were promising, leading to Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS trial). This prospective randomized multicenter trial comparing in utero fetal MMC (fMMC) closure to routine postnatal closure demonstrated a decreased need for shunting, reversal of hindbrain herniation, and improved neurologic function in the prenatal repair group, although maternal complications and prematurity were more frequently encountered. Because of the conclusion of the MOMS trial, fMMC closure has become a standard of care option for pregnancies complicated by a prenatal diagnosis of spina bifida. This article will provide background to the scope of MMC, review the MOMS trial data, and highlight the current clinical status of open fMMC closure."

The purpose of this study was 2-fold: to describe the natural history of forearm deformity in patients with MHO, with particular attention to those who develop radial head dislocation, and to determine predictors of deformity. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed charts of all patients with MHO evaluated at our institution. Patients with the presence of a radiographically visible osteochondroma in the forearm were divided into 5 groups or types based on location of the osteochondroma(s). Radiographic measurements included radial articular angle, percent ulnar variance, radial bow, radial length, ulnar length, and ulnar bow. The predictive values of each measure were statistically evaluated for each type with relation to radial head dislocation. RESULTS: Of 146 patients with MHO, 102 patients (70%) had forearm involvement. Appropriate anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were available on 48 patients (76 forearms). Average age at initial radiographic evaluation was 12 years (range, 2-18 y). Average follow-up period was 7 years (range 1-19 y). Thirteen forearms demonstrated radial head dislocation, with all but 1 reported in the type 1 limbs (solitary distal ulna osteochondroma). Radial head dislocation was noted in 34% (12/35 forearms) of type 1 limbs. CONCLUSIONS: Forearms with isolated osteochondromas of the distal ulna are the ones most likely to develop radial head dislocation. Because the ulna growth is disproportionately less than radial growth, the soft tissues may act as a tether, linking the distal radius and ulna, and lead to radial head dislocation.

The incidence varies based upon the disorder and typically ranges from 1 in 500,000 to 1 per million population. Symptoms vary with the disorder and residual level of the clotting factor, and can range from relatively minor such as epistaxis, to life threatening, such as intracranial hemorrhage. Rapid treatment of bleeding episodes in individuals with severe bleeding phenotypes is essential to preserve life or limb and to prevent long-term sequelae; therapeutic options depend on the deficiency and range from plasma-derived (eg, fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, factor X concentrate) to highly purified and recombinant single factor concentrates. The rarity of these disorders limits the feasibility of conventional prospective clinical trials; instead, clinicians rely upon registries, published case reports/series and experience to guide treatment. In some disorders, long-term prophylactic therapy is administered in response to the bleeding phenotype in an individual patient or based on the known natural history and severity of the deficiency. Intermittent prophylaxis, surrounding surgery, pregnancy, labor, and menstruation may be required to prevent or control excessive bleeding. This review summarizes therapeutic options, guidelines, recommendations and observations from the published literature for long-term, surgical, gynecological, and obstetric prophylaxis in deficiencies of fibrinogen; prothrombin; factors II, V, V/VIII, VII, X, XI and XIII; combined vitamin-K dependent factors; α2-antiplasmin; and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1.

Ideally, testing is done in animals with the analogous human disease to provide essential safety information, estimates of the correct starting dose and dose response (pharmacokinetics) and measures of efficacy (pharmacodynamics) that guide the design of human trials. For nearly seven decades, canine models of hemophilia, von Willebrand disease and other inherited bleeding disorders have not only informed our understanding of the natural history and pathophysiology of these disorders but also guided the development of novel therapeutics for use in humans and dogs. This has been especially important for the development of gene therapy, in which unique toxicities such as insertional mutagenesis, germ line gene transfer and viral toxicities must be assessed. There are several issues regarding comparative medicine in these species that have a bearing on these studies, including immune reactions to xenoproteins, varied metabolism or clearance of wild-type and modified proteins, and unique tissue tropism of viral vectors.

I describe the possible clinical consequences of an aberrant function of the natural anticoagulants regulating blood coagulation--antithrombin, protein C, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Understanding the physiologic function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor can illuminate why hemophilic patients bleed, but many other questions remain. I briefly review the four causes for acquired disorders of the blood coagulation reactions--vitamin K deficiency, hepatocellular disease, antibodies to clotting factors, and disseminated intravascular coagulation--but limit my comments to the mechanisms that trigger the formation of antibodies to clotting factors and how these antibodies can deplete the blood of clotting factor activities.

The main aim of this study was to determine changes in RV and LV size and function over time in an adult population with TOF repair and hemodynamically significant pulmonary regurgitation.Forty patients with repaired TOF and hemodynamically significant PR were included. These patients were identified on the basis of having more than one CMR between January 2008 and 2015. Patients with a prosthetic pulmonary valve or any cardiac intervention between CMR studies were excluded. Rate of progression (ROP) of RV dilation was determined for both indexed right ventricular end-systolic volume (RVESVi) and indexed right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDVi), and calculated as the difference between the last and first volumes divided by the number of years between CMR#1 and CMR#2. Subjects were also divided into two groups based on the distribution of the ROP of RV dilation: Group I-rapid ROP (>50th percentile) and Group II-slower ROP (≤50th percentile).The interval between CMR#1 and CMR#2 was 3.9 ± 1.7 years (range 1-8 years). We did find a significant change in RVEDVi and RVESVi over this time period, although the magnitude of change was small. Nine patients (23%) had a reduction in right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) by greater than 5%, 13 patients (33%) had an increase in RVEDVi by greater than 10 mL/m2 and seven patients (18%) had an increase in RVESVi by greater than 10 mL/m2 . Median ROP for RVEDVi was 1.8 (range -10.4 to 21.8) mL/(m2 year); RVESVi 1.1 (range -5.8 to 24.5) mL/(m2 year) and RVEF -0.5 (range -8 to 4)%/year. Patients with a rapid ROP had significantly larger RV volumes at the time of CMR#1 and lower RVEF as compared to the slow ROP group. There was no overall significant change in LVEDVi, LVESVi, or LVEF over this time period.We have demonstrated, in a small population of patients with hemodynamically significant PR, that there is a small increase in RV volumes and decrease in RVEF over a mean 4-year period. We believe it to be reasonable practice to perform CMR at least every 4 years in asymptomatic patients with repaired TOF and hemodynamically significant PR. We found that LV volumes and function remained stable during the study period, suggesting that significant progressive LV changes are less likely to occur over a shorter time period. Our results inform a safe standardized approach to monitoring adults with hemodynamically significant PR post TOF repair and assist in planning allocation of this expensive and limited resource."

RV muscular corpus (RVMC) EDVi significantly increased (130 ± 19 to 138 ± 20 mL/m2, p = 0.014), whereas RV outflow tract (RVOT) EDVi did not (12 ± 7 vs 13 ± 6 mL/m2, p = 0.390). No other RV or LV measures significantly changed during the inter-MRI period. The change in RVEDVi correlated significantly with LV end diastolic volume (r = - 0.582, p = 0.029), RVEDVi:LVEDVi (r = 0.6, p = 0.023) and RVMC EDVi (r = 0.9, p < 0.001) but not RVOT EDVi (r = 0.225, p = 0.459).Adult repaired TOF patients with free PR experienced a mean 3.1%, or 4.3 mL/m2, annual increase in RVEDVi, unrelated to the initial RVEDVi or PR fraction. The increase in RVEDVi was due to RVMC rather than RVOT dilatation. This provides a guide to the frequency of MR surveillance and insights into the natural history of progressive RV dilatation in this setting."

RESULTS: Men had more severe hemodynamic impairment and a higher number of cardiac reoperations than females. 41% of patients had at least one complication during pregnancy; there were 16 (67%) abortions and 39 (74%) Caesarian delivers; the recurrence of congenital heart defect was 10%. After pregnancy, there was a shift from first to second functional class: unique pregnancy determined no differences in term of morpho-functional ventricular features compared to nulliparous, but they complained fatigue and palpitation and echocardiographyc dysfunction. Left ventricular dysfunction and QRS duration at ECG were independent predictors of ventricular arrhythmias in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: There were no gender-specific differences in patients operated on for TOF using ventriculotomy. Pregnancy is an event in these patients at risk for the newborn, in terms of miscarriage, prematurity, and recurrence of birth defects, and for the mother in terms of ventricular dysfunction and electrical instability. At least a single pregnancy does not appear to significantly modify the natural history of post-surgical patients operated on for TOF."

Its mortality is secondary to sudden and spontaneous rupture of arteries or hollow organs. The genotype influences the distribution of arterial pathology with aneurysms of intra-abdominal visceral arteries being relatively uncommon. We describe the case of a young man with probable VEDS who died of a spontaneous rupture and dissection of the cystic artery. The patient initially presented with abdominal pain due to an unrecognized spontaneous perforation of the small intestine complicated by sepsis. We postulate that inflammatory mediators may have triggered the arterial rupture due to remodeling and weakening of vessel walls. The phenotype of the patient's vascular damage included bilateral spontaneous carotid-cavernous sinus fistulae and dissection with pseudoaneurysm formation of large- and medium-sized arteries, predominantly the abdominal aorta and its branches. The autopsy uncovered a long history of vascular events that may have been asymptomatic. These findings along with a positive family history supported the VEDS diagnosis. Loeys-Dietz, Marfan, and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection syndromes were ruled out based on the absence of arterial tortuosity, eye abnormalities, bone overgrowth, and the distribution of vascular damage among other features. Interestingly, microscopic examination of the hippocampus revealed a focus of neuronal heterotopia, commonly associated with epilepsy; however, the patient had no history of seizures. The natural course of VEDS involves the rupture and dissection of arteries that, if unrecognized, can lead to a rapid death after bleeding into free spaces."

Although clinically recognizable syndromes, notably Marfan, Ehlers Danlos, and Loeys-Dietz syndromes encompass the principal diagnosable phenotypes along the genetic vascular disorder spectrum, a substantial subset of patients cannot be adequately classified under a known diagnosis through clinical or molecular diagnostic methods. Here we describe patients presenting with multiple-aneurysms and/or pseudoaneurysm syndromes (MAPS), and clinically characterize this novel phenotype, present data on natural history and prognosis, and propose management guidelines.Thirty-two patients with MAPS were identified from February 2006 to October 2015 through the University of Colorado Adult Medical Genetics Clinic. A subset of patients underwent clinical genetic testing utilizing the Marfan/TAAD/Related disorders panel, and another subset was enrolled for research-based exome-sequencing.Thirty-two patients (10 men, 22 women) were classified as MAPS patients with an average age of diagnosis at 39.5 (±13.3) and 35.4 (±12.8) years, respectively. Symptom presentation and progression are presented based on vascular territory, notably of the heart, head, and neck, which could manifest with fatal complications. Secondary arterial events occurred at an average of 6.7±6.0 years after the initial MAPS episode. Genetic analysis revealed 9 gene variants that are likely pathogenic and implicated in MAPS.These data more broadly illuminate a phenotype of aneurysms, dissections, and/or pseudoaneurysms that do not classify under a recognizable genetic vascular diagnosis. Our data should provide useful clinical information for providers managing patients with MAPS."

OBJECTIVES:The study aimed to characterize factors and markers influencing cognitive and functional progression among individuals at-risk for developing MCI-AD, and examine data for more precise predictors of cognitive change, particularly in relation to APOE ε4 subgroup. DESIGN:This single-site study was conducted at the Imperial College London (ICL) in the United Kingdom. Participants 60 to 85 years of age were classified as high, medium (amnestic or non-amnestic) or low risk for developing MCI-AD based on RBANS z-scores. A series of clinical outcome assessments (COAs) on factors influencing baseline cognitive changes were collected in each of the instrument categories of cognition, lifestyle exposure, mood, and sleep. Data collection was planned to occur every 6 months for 48 months, however the median follow-up time was 18.1 months due to early termination of study by the sponsor. RESULTS:987 participants were screened, among them 690 participants were actively followed-up post baseline, of whom 165 (23.9%) were APOE ε4 carriers; with at least one copy of the allele. The mean age was 68.73 years, 94.6% were white, 57.4% were female, and 34.8% had a Family History of Dementia with a somewhat larger percentage in the APOE ε4 carrier group (42.4%) compared to the non-carrier group (32.4%). Over half of the participants were married and 53% had a Bachelor's or higher degree. Most frequently, safety events typical for this population consisted of upper respiratory tract infection (10.4%), falls (5.2%), hypertension (3.5%) and back pain (3.0%). Conclusion (clinical relevance): AD-related measures collected during the CHARIOT PRO Main study will allow identification and evaluation of AD risk factors and markers associated with cognitive performance from the pre-clinical stage. Evaluating the psycho-biological characteristics of these pre-symptomatic individuals in relation to their natural neurocognitive trajectories will enhance current understanding on determinants of the initial signs of cognitive changes linked to AD."

The aim of our retrospective multicenter study was to find predictors of recurrence in patients with pheochromocytomas and sympathetic paragangliomas submitted to radical surgery in Piedmont (a region in northwest Italy). We collected data from 242 patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2016. Forty-two patients (17.4%) had disease recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed that genetic mutation (HR = 3.62; 95% CI 1.44-9.13; p = 0.006), younger age (HR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.95-0.99; p = 0.031) and larger tumor size (HR = 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.02; p = 0.015) were independently associated with a higher recurrence risk of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma; in pheochromocytomas, genetic mutation (HR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.00-11.48; p = 0.049), younger age (HR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.94-0.99; p = 0.02), higher tumor size (HR = 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.03; p = 0.043) and PASS value (HR = 1.16; 95% CI 1.03-1.3; p = 0.011) were associated with recurrence.

Disease severity assessment by various prognostic factors play important role in management of these patients. The aim of our study was to assess various factors and their natural history and course of disease in Indian population. Material and Methods:We followed 27 patients of IPAH after complete work up of exclusion of other causes of pulmonary hypertension and analysed various demographic, echocardiographic and haemodynamic parameters and their correlation with mortality. Results:A total of 27 patients (14 new and 13 previously diagnosed) were followed for mean duration of 18 months. At time of data analysis, 11 patients were alive and 16 patients died with overall mortality rate of 59.25%. Among various factors, presence of pericardial effusion (p=0.005), pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) (p = 0.005), tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) (p = 0.0004), heart rate (p=0.031), mean blood pressure (p =0.017), right atrial pressure (p=0.045), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) (p=0.039) and six minute walk distance (p= 0.0002) were significantly associated with mortality. On multivariate cox proportional hazard analysis, PAAT (p =0.034), TAPSE (p=0.003) and six minute walk distance (p=0.002) remained significant predictors of mortality. Conclusion:Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with poor prognosis and survival despite advancements of disease specific therapies. Higher mortality in our study is due to delayed presentation and diagnosis. Also lack of availability of prostacyclins and lung transplantation in advanced stages of disease contribute to higher mortality in Indian setup. Non-invasive echocardiographic factors and six minute walk distance are important prognostic factors that help in disease severity stratification to identify patients in need of intensive medical management."

In order to determine the natural history of this disorder, the outcome of 12 infants with neonatal hepatitis secondary to hypopituitarism is reviewed. The clinical diagnosis of hypopituitarism was established on a combination of features, which include dysmorphism (4 infants), optic nerve hypoplasia (8 infants), micropenis (5 male infants) and recurrent hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 2.4 mmol/l (8 infants)). Endocrine investigation revealed low free thyroxine (T4) levels (< 10 pmol/l), with normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (0.4-4.5 mU/l) (11 infants), and serum cortisol levels which were inappropriately low (< 200 nmol/l). In 9 of 12 infants, liver disease resolved within 6 wk following treatment with thyroxine, hydrocortisone and, where appropriate, growth hormone, including Cases 9 and 1 in whom diagnosis and treatment were delayed until 3 mo and 3 y of age, respectively. Liver disease resolved spontaneously in two infants prior to starting hormone replacement therapy (Cases 11, 12), and one male infant (Case 10), in whom the diagnosis and hormone replacement therapy were delayed until 5 y of age, developed cirrhosis and portal hypertension and later underwent liver transplantation. CONCLUSION:The diagnosis of hypopituitarism should always be considered in infants with unexplained neonatal hepatitis. Delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment was associated with persistently abnormal liver function tests and may lead to irreversible liver disease."

METHODS AND RESULTS:FD screening was performed in 150 adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and found 25 Fabry patients (16.6%). The p.F113L mutation was found in 21 of them, leading to a genealogy study and haplotype analysis of the p.F113L patients. Genealogy research revealed a 12-generation family tree with a common ancestor to p.F113L patients, suggesting a founder effect that was supported by haplotype findings. Pedigree analysis was performed and 120 consecutive p.F113L patients underwent a predefined diagnostic evaluation of FD multiorgan involvement. This late-onset phenotype was characterized by common and/or potentially severe cardiac manifestations (left ventricular hypertrophy 40.8%, atrial fibrillation 5%, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia 12.5%, atrioventricular block 18.3%, bifascicular block 13.4%).

We established the International Calmodulinopathy Registry (ICalmR) to understand the natural history, clinical features, and response to therapy of patients with a CALM-mediated arrhythmia syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS:A dedicated Case Report File was created to collect demographic, clinical, and genetic information. ICalmR has enrolled 74 subjects, with a variant in the CALM1 (n = 36), CALM2 (n = 23), or CALM3 (n = 15) genes. Sixty-four (86.5%) were symptomatic and the 10-year cumulative mortality was 27%. The two prevalent phenotypes are long QT syndrome (LQTS; CALM-LQTS, n = 36, 49%) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT; CALM-CPVT, n = 21, 28%). CALM-LQTS patients have extremely prolonged QTc intervals (594 ± 73 ms), high prevalence (78%) of life-threatening arrhythmias with median age at onset of 1.5 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.1-5.5 years] and poor response to therapies. Most electrocardiograms (ECGs) show late onset peaked T waves. All CALM-CPVT patients were symptomatic with median age of onset of 6.0 years (IQR 3.0-8.5 years). Basal ECG frequently shows prominent U waves. Other CALM-related phenotypes are idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF, n = 7), sudden unexplained death (SUD, n = 4), overlapping features of CPVT/LQTS (n = 3), and predominant neurological phenotype (n = 1). Cardiac structural abnormalities and neurological features were present in 18 and 13 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION:Calmodulinopathies are largely characterized by adrenergically-induced life-threatening arrhythmias. Available therapies are disquietingly insufficient, especially in CALM-LQTS.

Results: Incidence of family history of sudden death (7/12 vs. 22.9% (11/48)) and percentage of type 1 ST elevation in the peripheral ECG leads (6/12 vs. 16.67% (8/48)) were significantly higher in VA group than in non-VA group (both P<0.05). Max Tpeak-Tend (Max-Tpe) interval ((144±53)ms vs. (110±16)ms) and dispersion of Tpe ((74±50)ms vs. (43±17)ms) were significantly higher in VA group than in non-VA group (both P<0.05). The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the Max-Tpe interval was 0.693 and Max-Tpe interval ≥140 ms was determined as an optimized cutoff point with increased risk of VA event, which had a sensitivity of 50.0%, a specificity of 98.0%, a positive predictive value of 85.7%, and a negative predictive value of 88.7% for predicting VA event. The ROC curves for the dispersion of Tpe was 0.775 and dispersion of Tpe ≥45 ms was determined as an optimized cutoff point for predicting VA event, which had a sensitivity of 91.7%, a specificity of 64.6%, a positive predictive value of 39.3%, and a negative predictive value of 96.9% for predicting VA event. In multivariate analysis, Max-Tpe interval ≥140 ms (OR=27.53, 95%CI 1.07-706.77, P=0.045) and family history of sudden death (OR=24.63, 95%CI 2.05-295.38, P=0.011) were found to be the independent risk factors of arrhythmic events. Conclusions: Max-Tpe interval ≥140 ms and family history of sudden death are risk factors of VA event in included patients with Brugada syndrome."

Due to its rarity and non-specific presentation, the entity is often not promptly recognized resulting in delayed diagnosis. Two major milestones in cystinosis management, cystine-depleting therapy with cysteamine and renal allograft transplantation, have had a considerable impact on the natural history and prognosis of cystinosis patients. However, due to its significant side effects and a strict 6-hourly dosing regimen, non-adherence to the immediate release of cysteamine bitartrate formulation (Cystagon®) is a major issue that might affect long-term outcome. Recently, a new twice-daily administered delayed-release enteric-coated formula of cysteamine bitartrate (Procysbi(TM)) has been approved by the European Medical Agency for the treatment of cystinosis, and has been shown to be safe and effective. This delayed-release cysteamine has the potential to improve compliance and hence prognosis, through its better dosing regimen, positive impact on quality of life and possibly less side-effects, and is now tested in an ongoing long-term clinical trial. Longer survival of patients with cystinosis makes transition from pediatric to adult-oriented care another challenge in cystinosis management and requires an extended multidisciplinary approach."

The aim of this study is to describe the clinical, biochemical, and histopathological findings in a group of Mexican HT1 patients and their outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Medical records of HT1 patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2011 were analyzed. The diagnosis of HT1 was confirmed by detection of succinylacetone in urine or blood. RESULTS:Sixteen nonrelated HT1 cases were analyzed. Mean age at clinical onset was 9 months, and the mean age at diagnosis was 16.3 months. Main clinical findings were hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, cirrhosis, liver failure, tubulopathy, nephromegaly, Fanconi syndrome, seizures and failure to thrive. Histopathological findings were cirrhosis, fibrosis and steatosis. The HT1 group had a mortality rate of 78%. Patients who received supportive care or nutritional treatment had a 3-year survival rate of 10%. For those who underwent liver transplantation, the 6-year survival rate was 60%. In most cases pharmacological treatment with nitisinone and special dietary products were not available. The leading causes of death were fulminant liver failure, metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, and porphyria-like neurologic crisis. Newborn screening programs in combination with the availability of orphan drugs, proper monitoring, genetic counseling, and clinical practice guidelines are needed to enable physicians to identify the disease, delay its progression, and improve patients' quality of life.

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions."

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]"

This can put them at risk of problems with bleeding, particularly into the brain. One baby per week in the UK may be seriously affected and milder forms can affect one in every 1000 births. HOW IS IT CAUSED?: Platelets are blood cells that are very important in helping blood to clot. All platelets have natural proteins on their surface called human platelet antigens (HPAs). In babies, half of these antigens are inherited from the mother and half from the father. During pregnancy, some of the baby's platelets can cross into the mother's bloodstream. In most cases, this does not cause a problem. But in cases of FNAIT, the mother's immune system does not recognise the baby's HPAs that were inherited from the father and develops antibodies, which can cross the placenta and attack the baby's platelets. These antibodies are called anti-HPAs, and the commonest antibody implicated is anti-HPA-1a, but there are other rarer antibody types. If this happens, the baby's platelets may be destroyed causing their platelet count to fall dangerously low. If the platelet count is very low there is a risk to the baby of bleeding into their brain before they are born. This is very rare but if it happens it can have serious effects on the baby's health. HOW IS IT INHERITED?: A baby inherits half of their HPAs from its mother and half from its father. Consequently, a baby may have different HPAs from its mother. As the condition is very rare, and even if the baby is at risk of the condition we have no way of knowing how severely they will be affected, routine screening is not currently recommended. WHAT CAN BE DONE?: FNAIT is usually diagnosed if a previous baby has had a low platelet count. The parents are offered blood tests and the condition can be confirmed or ruled out. There are many other causes of low platelets in babies, which may also need to be tested for. As the condition is so rare, expertise is limited to specialist centres and normally a haematologist and fetal medicine doctor will perform and interpret the tests together. Fortunately, there is an effective treatment for the vast majority of cases called immunoglobulin, or IVIg. This 'blood product' is given intravenously through a drip every week to women at risk of the condition. It may be started from as early as 16 weeks in the next pregnancy, until birth, which would be offered at around 36-37 weeks. Less common treatments that may be considered depending on individual circumstances include steroid tablets or injections, or giving platelet transfusions to the baby. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER TELL YOU?: This paper considers the latest evidence in relation to treatment options in the management of pregnancies at risk of FNAIT. Specifically, we discuss the role of screening, when IVIg should be started, what dose should be used, and what evidence there is for maternal steroids. We also consider in very rare selected cases, the use of fetal blood sampling and giving platelet transfusions to the baby before birth. Finally, we consider the approaches to blood testing mothers to tell if babies are at risk, which is offered in some countries, and development of new treatments to reduce the risk of FNAIT."

A Chinese male foetus, whose mother had a history of multiple intrauterine foetal demise and/or hydrops, was diagnosed with severe FNAIT at 27 weeks of gestational age. Immunological analysis revealed total absence of CD36 on platelets and monocytes from mother, caused by a 329-330delAC mutation of the CD36 gene. Anti-CD36 and anti-HLA class I antibodies were detected in the maternal serum, whereas only anti-CD36 isoantibodies were detectable in the foetal blood sample. Serial intrauterine transfusions with red blood cells (RBC) and platelets from a CD36null donor were performed to improve the severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia. The baby (2250 g; Apgar scores 10) was delivered vaginally at 32 weeks of gestation with normal haemoglobin (186 g/L) but low platelet count (48 × 109/L).

Main outcome data were prevalence of HPA-1a negativity, HPA-1a immunisation, platelet count at birth and perinatal ICH. We aimed to compare outcome with and without intervention. MAIN RESULTS:   HPA-1a alloimmunisation occurred in 294/3028 (9.7%) pregnancies at risk. Severe FNAIT occurred in 71/227 (31%) immunised pregnancies, with perinatal ICH in 7/71 (10%). True natural history data were not found because interventions were performed in most screen-positive women. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:   Screening for HPA-1a alloimmunisation detects about two cases in 1000 pregnancies. The calculated risk for perinatal ICH of 10% in pregnancies with severe FNAIT is an underestimation because studies without interventions were lacking. Screening of all pregnancies together with effective antenatal treatment such as intravenous immunoglobulin may reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with FNAIT."

It results from the replacement of glutamate for valine at the sixth amino acid of the beta-globin chain. The mutation results in hemoglobin S (HbS) tetramers that accumulate during tissue hypoxia, oxidative stress or dehydration. The accumulation leads to red blood cell sickling, early destruction of erythrocytes, and widespread vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC), subsequently resulting in multiorgan damage. Some of the renal complications, collectively known as sickle cell nephropathy (SCN), include hematuria, hyposthenuria, renal papillary necrosis, proteinuria, renal tubular disorders, acute and chronic kidney injury, sickle cell glomerulopathy, and renal medullary carcinoma. Clinically significant renal involvement occurs more frequently in sickle cell disease than in sickle cell trait or in combined hemoglobinopathies, except renal medullary carcinoma, which appears to be more common among sickle cell trait patients. [1] Natural history of SCD is highly variable with reduced life expectancy with multiorgan damage in symptomatic patients. In general, all patients have a reduced lifespan. Median survival in the United States and Jamaica is 45 to 55 years. [2] Natural history by age in SCD is as follows: Newborn babies are asymptomatic for an initial couple of months, given fetal Hb (HbF) predominance. Early childhood is characterized by episodes of dactylitis, acute chest syndrome (ACS), sepsis, splenic sequestration, and stroke. Human parvovirus B19 infection can lead to severe and sudden anemia in children and adolescents with SCD as the virus destroys precursors of the red blood cells. After age 5: Classic painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), which increases in frequency with age. Adolescence is associated with nocturnal enuresis, avascular necrosis of the hip, leg ulcerations, delayed puberty, and priapism.[2]. After age 25 to 30, the frequency of VOC tends to reduce and is replaced with signs and symptoms of chronic organ damage, including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, sickle hepatopathy, and sickle cell nephropathy (SCN).[2]. The primary cause of death in younger patients is usually infection; whereas, in older patients, the primary cause of death is mostly irreversible organ damage.[3]"

Currently, the only HbF modulator with a clear place in the management of childhood SCD is hydroxycarbamide for which the main indications are frequent painful crises and recurrent acute chest syndrome. In the majority of SCD children treated with hydroxycarbamide there is clear evidence of clinical benefit and the drug is well tolerated. The main disadvantages are the need for frequent monitoring and uncertainity about long-term risks of carcinogenicity and impaired fertility, although these risks appear to be very low. The role of hydroxycarbamide in sickle-associated central nervous system disease remains to be established.

Major malformations are rare, and include pyloric stenosis, anal agenesis, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and congenital heart defects. Abnormal EEGs and seizures have been reported in almost 70% of patients. Brain MRI shows corpus callosum abnormalities associated with dilatation of lateral ventricles and, less frequently, periventricular nodular heterotopias, mild cerebellar defects, and reduced periventricular white matter. Chiari 1 malformation seems to be frequent.

Molecular abnormalities, which are frequently heterozygous missense mutations localized in exon 2 of FGA and exon 8 of FGG, lead to defects in one or more phases of fibrinogen to fibrin conversion, fibrin network formation, and other important functions of fibrinogen. The clinical phenotype is highly heterogeneous, from no manifestations to bleeding and/or thrombotic events. Asymptomatic propositi and relatives with the predisposing genotype are at risk of developing adverse outcomes during the natural course of the disease. Correlations between genotype and phenotype have not yet been clearly established, with the exception of some abnormal fibrinogens that severely increase the risk of thrombosis. Functional analysis of polymerization and fibrinolysis, structural studies of the fibrin network and the viscoelastic properties of fibrin clot could help to predict the phenotype of congenital dysfibrinogenemia, but have not yet been evaluated in detail.

Deficiency or functional abnormality of the factors involved in these reactions causes bleeding disorders. Natural inhibitors of clotting factors include antithrombin III, protein S, and protein C. When activated, these proteins inactivate specific clotting factors, providing a regulatory mechanism that serves to control the coagulation response and limit the extension of the clot. Physiologic or natural inhibitors should not be confused with acquired inhibitors of coagulation factors, which are discussed in this review. Inhibitors to coagulation factors, also known as circulating anticoagulants, are antibodies that neutralize specific clotting proteins, thereby interfering with their normal function. Antibodies may be directed against isolated clotting factors, as is the case with factor VIII or IX inhibitors. On the other hand, the antiphospholipid antibodies are known to develop against multiple coagulation proteins. In contrast to patients with antibodies against isolated clotting factors, who commonly present with spontaneous bleeding, individuals with antiphospholipid antibodies may be asymptomatic or present with venous or arterial thrombosis. In this article I refer to inhibitors developing in patients with hemophilia A or other congenital factor deficiency as alloantibodies, and to spontaneous formation of antibodies in patients without prior history of hemorrhagic diathesis as autoantibodies.

These criteria apply to the most common variants of HCC but they do not suffice in all cases. That makes additional criteria and certain refinements necessary. A promising approach to the diagnosis of HCC is that based upon consideration by the pathologist of some relevant aspects of the natural history of this tumor. A panel of tests exploring the various functions and properties of liver cells should be set up. Tests for bile and fibrinogen synthesis are most important because they reflect specific and exclusive properties of the original cell line. Bile synthesis in tumor tissue is reflected by the finding of cholecholatestasis, namely bilirubinostasis and retention of copper and copper-binding proteins. The positive immunostaining for fibrinogen may appear in the form of cytoplasmic granules occurring in 50% of HCC, or in the form of fibrinogen-ground-glass (G-G) inclusions, representing a specific feature of HCC. During neoplastic transformation oncofetal proteins may reappear, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) being very common. Despite sensitivity of AFP, this test, similar to alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), has very low specificity, because of the widespread occurrence of these proteins in a variety of tumors. The selection of special 'clones' such as Mallory bodies and fibrinogen-G-G is of particular value, because of the specificity of these peculiar cytoplasmic changes. Although rare, the presence of HBV antigens in tumor tissue is virtually pathognomonic for HCC. The availability of nonneoplastic liver tissue for morphological examination is of great help, because it may carry key information or markers of the development stages of HCC: cirrhosis, liver cell dysplasia, HBV antigens, congenital metabolic disorders, such as hemochromatosis and AAT deficiency. The two latter conditions represent the link with the last working hypothesis of the present study, i.e. that during neoplastic transformation hepatocytes may 'switch' their 'phenotype' thus escaping the storage phenomena, which continue to occur in nonneoplastic hepatocytes. This study provides a guideline to a dynamic approach to the diagnosis of HCC. The rationale is listed in 5 points; among them, bile production, fibrinogen synthesis, Mallory body and fibrinogen-G-G selection, HBV antigen expression can be considered at present as confident markers for the morphological diagnosis of HCC."

A greater knowledge of the genetics of inherited RCC has the potential to translate into novel therapeutic targets for sporadic RCC. METHODS:A literature review was performed summarising the current knowledge on hereditary RCC diagnosis, surveillance and management. RESULTS:Familial RCC is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although inherited RCC may present without a relevant family history. A number of familial RCC syndromes have been identified. Familial non-syndromic RCC is suspected when ≥ 2 relatives are affected in the absence of syndromic features, although clear diagnostic criteria are lacking. Young age at onset and bilateral/multicentric tumours are recognised characteristics which should prompt molecular genetic analysis. Surveillance in individuals at risk of inherited RCC aims to prevent morbidity and mortality via early detection of tumours. Though screening and management guidelines for some inherited RCC syndromes (e.g. von Hippel-Lindau disease, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis) are well defined for rare cause of inherited RCC (e.g. germline BAP1 mutations), there is limited information regarding the lifetime RCC risks and the most appropriate screening modalities.

We recommend abdominal imaging every 36 months in individuals without renal lesions at initial screening. Once renal tumors are identified, they should be followed with interval imaging studies until the largest tumor reaches 3 cm in maximal diameter, at which point nephron-sparing surgery should be ideally pursued. While the histology of renal tumors can vary in the BHD syndrome, most tumors possess a relatively indolent natural history and do not require adjuvant therapy if resected when localized to the kidney. With this approach, the vast majority of patients will achieve a curative oncologic outcome and avoid the medical sequelae of chronic renal insufficiency that could otherwise result from total nephrectomy."

METHODS:Patients with nonatherosclerotic SCAD followed prospectively at Vancouver General Hospital who underwent repeat angiography were included in this study. Those who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for SCAD were excluded. Baseline patient demographics and in-hospital and long-term cardiovascular events were recorded.

Angiographic healing occurred in 157 of 182 lesions (86.3%). Of repeat angiography performed ≥30 days post-SCAD, 152 of 160 (95%) showed spontaneous angiographic healing. CONCLUSIONS:The majority of coronary arteries affected by SCAD heal spontaneously on repeat angiography, with apparent time dependency, with the vast majority having complete healing after 30 days from the SCAD event."

It is increasingly recognized as an important cause of myocardial infarction (MI) in women. We aimed to assess the natural history of SCAD, which has not been adequately explored. METHODS AND RESULTS:We performed a multicentre, prospective, observational study of patients with non-atherosclerotic SCAD presenting acutely from 22 centres in North America. Institutional ethics approval and patient consents were obtained. We recorded baseline demographics, in-hospital characteristics, precipitating/predisposing conditions, angiographic features (assessed by core laboratory), in-hospital major adverse events (MAE), and 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We prospectively enrolled 750 SCAD patients from June 2014 to June 2018. Mean age was 51.8 ± 10.2 years, 88.5% were women (55.0% postmenopausal), 87.7% were Caucasian, and 33.9% had no cardiac risk factors. Emotional stress was reported in 50.3%, and physical stress in 28.9% (9.8% lifting >50 pounds). Predisposing conditions included fibromuscular dysplasia 31.1% (45.2% had no/incomplete screening), systemic inflammatory diseases 4.7%, peripartum 4.5%, and connective tissue disorders 3.6%. Most were treated conservatively (84.3%), but 14.1% underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and 0.7% coronary artery bypass surgery. In-hospital composite MAE was 8.8%; peripartum SCAD patients had higher in-hospital MAE (20.6% vs. 8.2%, P = 0.023). Overall 30-day MACE was 8.8%. Peripartum SCAD and connective tissue disease were independent predictors of 30-day MACE. CONCLUSION:Spontaneous coronary artery dissection predominantly affects women and presents with MI. Despite majority of patients being treated conservatively, survival was good. However, significant cardiovascular complications occurred within 30 days. Long-term follow-up and further investigations on management are warranted."

It is theorized that CW leads to ischemic stroke secondary to blood flow stasis and subsequent embolization. The natural history and optimal management of CW are unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of CW. Methods- Our librarians performed a SLR for CW and related terminology. Patient-level demographics, stroke risk factors, neuroimaging findings, stroke recurrence or stroke free-duration, and treatment modality were extracted. We used descriptive statistics to characterize our results. When specific patient-level metrics were not reported, the denominators for reporting percentage calculations were adjusted accordingly. Results- Our literature search produced 1150 articles. Thirty-seven articles including 158 patients (median age 46 years [range 16-85], 68% women, 76% symptomatic) met entry criteria and were included in our SLR. Of the symptomatic CW patients: 57% did not have stroke risk factors, 56% who received medical therapy had recurrent stroke (median 12 months, range 0-97), and 72% were ultimately treated with carotid revascularization (50% carotid stenting, 50% carotid endarterectomy). There were no periprocedural complications or recurrent strokes in carotid revascularization patients. Conclusions- CW leads to ischemic stroke in younger patients without conventional stroke risk factors. We found a high stroke recurrence rate in medically managed symptomatic CW patients, whereas carotid revascularization effectively prevented recurrent stroke. Our findings should be interpreted with caution because of risk of publication and reporting bias."

Imaging and pathologic analysis have defined CaW as an intimal variant of fibromuscular dysplasia, which appears as a shelflike lesion on the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb, more specifically at the origin of internal carotid artery. Reported findings of carotid webs in young patients with recurrent ischemic strokes without an otherwise determined cause have raised questions about the mechanism, natural history, and need for intervention. This review addresses the current understanding of CaW and highlights findings that prompt further investigation into this unique vascular entity as a modifiable stroke risk factor. Observations:Imaging analysis demonstrates hemodynamic disturbance in the presence of CaWs. The protuberant shelflike structure creates a pocket therein that may subsequently lead to local thrombosis and cerebral embolism. Computed tomographic angiography is an accurate and often used noninvasive diagnostic modality. Although treatment paradigms have not been systematically evaluated, antiplatelet monotherapy may not be sufficient to reduce recurrent ischemic events in the small series of patients with stroke and symptomatic CaWs. Conclusions and Relevance:The limited clinical data on CaWs, although complicated by selection bias, suggest an increased prevalence of these vascular entities in cerebral ischemic events among patients younger than 60 years. Imaging suggests CaW to be a possible nidus for cerebral thromboembolism. Physicians should consider CaW as a cause of stroke in younger patients with anterior circulation ischemic strokes of an otherwise undetermined cause. Treatment options in CaWs with ischemic strokes have not been extensively investigated. Multicenter observational studies evaluating the natural history of CaW are warranted."

In the United States Registry for FMD, 41.7% of patients experienced an aneurysm and/or dissection by the time of entry into the Registry. We sought to determine the occurrence of neurovascular events after FMD diagnosis and any changes on cervical artery imaging that may be attributable to FMD. METHODS:Patients followed at the Mount Sinai Medical Center (US Registry for FMD enrollment center) with confirmed FMD and > 1 cervical artery imaging study (at least ± 6 months from the baseline carotid duplex ultrasound [CDU]) between the years 2003 and 2015 were included. Medical records and cervical artery imaging ([CDU], magnetic resonance angiogram [MRA], and computed tomography angiogram [CTA]) were reviewed. New arterial dissection, aneurysm, transient ischemic attack, stroke, or new FMD findings were recorded. RESULTS:Among 146 FMD patients with complete information, 52 (35.6%) had an aneurysm and 52 (35.6%) had a dissection. Mean clinical follow-up was 35.3 ± 25.3 months (range 5-153 months); patients underwent 4 ± 2.7 CDU (range 1-17); 86.3% had ≥1 neck MRA or CTA. After FMD diagnosis, 3 patients (2%) experienced a new carotid artery dissection; 1 patient experienced a stroke due to concomitant atherosclerosis. No new aneurysms occurred. In patients with cervical artery FMD, imaging findings remained stable throughout follow-up. No patient developed new cervical artery FMD findings on follow-up imaging. CONCLUSIONS:No new cervical artery FMD or aneurysm was observed on subsequent imaging. New carotid dissection was uncommon over a mean follow-up period of 35.3 ± 25.3 months and was the only non-atherosclerotic vascular event observed after FMD diagnosis."

Lesions involved the foot (18 with 6 in the toes and 2 on the plantar foot), distal ankle (4), hand (4 with 2 in the thumbs), and wrist (1). All cases showed predominantly classic DFSP morphology and were diffusely CD34 positive. Myxoid change, melanin pigmented, and giant cell fibroblastoma foci were each present in 1 case, respectively.

After a 2-year course, the patient has no evidence of residual disease (40 mo). No metastases were documented in any of the cases studied. The natural history of DFSP of distal extremities and acral sites is similar to that of its counterparts elsewhere. A high index of suspicion, careful morphologic examination for key histologic features of DFSP, and in selected cases, molecular studies to identify the pathognomonic COL1A1-PDGFB gene fusion should facilitate the distinction of these rare, locally aggressive neoplasms from morphologic mimics that may arise in distal extremities and acral sites."

However, its diagnosis is challenging on biopsies showing negative staining for these 2 markers. The differential diagnoses include fibrosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and other benign and malignant lesions. A complete resection, with or without radiotherapy, is required because this lesion appears to be locally aggressive. However, the clinical outcome seems to be good.

Correlating the case history, imaging and histopathology, this case can best be summarised as a natural history of conversion from a low to high-grade myxoid malignancy. We emphasise that the overlapping features of myxoid malignancy (fibromyxosarcoma vs myxofibrosarcoma) and regional variation in tumour morphology in biopsy specimen may mislead the clinician. Therefore, knowledge about the key differentiating features as well as incisional biopsy of each radiologically different area can increase the possibility of correct diagnosis and management of each case."

This study was performed to describe the clinical characteristics and natural history of Chinese patients to improve clinical awareness of this condition. METHODS:In this study, we retrospectively investigated 23 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of hereditary ATTR-CM in Peking Union Medical College hospital from From January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2018. RESULTS:In all, 16 patients (69.6%) were males, the median age at disease onset was 45 (33,55) years old. The median duration from symptom onset to diagnosis was 30 (18,46) months. Phenotypes were classified as exclusively cardiac (n = 1, 4.3%) and mixed type (n = 22, 95.6%). The common mutations were Gly47Arg (7 patients [30.4%]) and Val30Ala (3 patients [13%]). Ventricular hypertrophy was observed in 23 (100%) patients, the mean thickness of the ventricular septum was 16.1 ± 3.9 mm, the mean thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall was 15.1 ± 2.8 mm. The mean left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) was 57.3 ± 11.9% and only 5 patients (21.7%) had LVEF < 50%. 18 (78.3%) patients had abnormal electrocardiography and the most common feature was pseudoinfarct pattern (56.5%).

CONCLUSIONS:The clinical characteristics of ATTR are heterogeneous: men are more likely to be affected and onset symptoms are not obvious in the heart and mainly include peripheral neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy; however, LV hypertrophy, especially a thick ventricular septum and posterior wall with preserved LVEF, are often detected on echocardiography. Abnormal ECG manifestations are common. The prognosis is poor, and patients with EF > 50% have better survival.

This patient eventually underwent a heart transplant because of progressive cardiac amyloidosis (CA) resulting in end-stage heart failure. However, symptoms in carpal tunnel and lumbar spine manifested years before the symptoms of heart failure. ATTRwt amyloidosis may present as a clinical triad of lumbar stenosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and heart failure. Recently developed medications have shown efficacy in slowing the progress of systemic and cardiac amyloidosis. CONCLUSIONS:Knowing that extracardiac symptoms may occur first, we propose that sending ligamentum flavum and flexor tenosynovium for pathologic evaluation may be a unique opportunity to screen and treat a population of patients at risk for developing CA and heart failure."

We expected FF would increase with infants' age (as time in contact with mothers decreased) and would more likely occur in the absence of physical contact between the dyad. There was no effect of age in the proportion of interaction time spent in FF, nor in types of FF. A quarter of FF episodes occurred in the absence of physical contact between the dyad, and in most of them physical contact was resumed following the FF. Contrary to predictions, the stability in the first year, mainly when mothers-female infants were in contact, indicates that FF act primarily promoting opportunities for affective communication and intuitive care. However, we found some supportive evidence for the hypothesis that FF regulate proximity between mother and infant, mainly in resume physical contact."

These interventions acknowledge the importance of group processes yet in practice primarily focus on the idiosyncratic personal vulnerabilities that lead people to engage in violence. This conceptualization is problematic because it disconnects the individual from the group and fails to adequately address the role of group processes in radicalization. To address this shortcoming, we propose a genuinely social psychological account of radicalization as an alternative. We draw on recent developments in theory and research in psychological science to suggest that radicalization is fundamentally a group socialization process through which people develop identification with a set of norms-that may be violent or nonviolent-through situated social interactions that leverage their shared perceptions and experiences. Our alternative provides a way of understanding shifts toward violent extremism that are caused by both the content (focal topics) and process of social interactions. This means that people's radicalization to violence is inseparable from the social context in which their social interactions take place."

Herein, the effects of the protein aggregate magnesium-ammonium phospholinoleate-palmitoleate anhydride, known as P-MAPA, and the human recombinant interleukin-12 (hrIL-12) were tested alone or in combination in human SKOV-3 cells. The doses and period were defined based on a previous study, which showed that 25 μg/mL P-MAPA and 1 ng/mL IL-12 are sufficient to reduce cell metabolism after 48 h. Indeed, among 2,881 proteins modulated by the treatments, 532 of them were strictly concordant and common. P-MAPA therapy upregulated proteins involved in tight junction, focal adhesion, ribosome constitution, GTP hydrolysis, semaphorin interactions, and expression of SLIT and ROBO, whereas it downregulated ERBB4 signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, regulation of NOTCH 4, and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In addition, IL-12 therapy led to upregulation of leukocyte migration, tight junction, and cell signaling, while cell communication, cell metabolism, and Wnt signaling were significantly downregulated in OC cells. A clear majority of proteins that were overexpressed by the combination of P-MAPA with IL-12 are involved in tight junction, focal adhesion, DNA methylation, metabolism of RNA, and ribosomal function; only a small number of downregulated proteins were involved in cell signaling, energy and mitochondrial processes, cell oxidation and senescence, and Wnt signaling. These findings suggest that P-MAPA and IL-12 efficiently regulated important proteins associated with OC progression; these altered proteins may represent potential targets for OC treatment in addition to its immunoadjuvant effects."

A 19-year-old female patient with past medical history of hypogammaglobulinemia and natural killer cell deficiency and stage III follicular lymphoma, in remission, presented with a right-sided pneumonia, noted to have acute kidney injury and proteinuria. Complement C3 and C4 levels were normal. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. A renal biopsy showed numerous fractured tubular casts that were periodic acid-Schiff and silver-stain negative and fuchsinophilic on trichrome stain, with associated giant cells, tubulitis, acute tubular injury, and tubular rupture. The tubular casts had 3+ staining for lambda light chains and 0-1+ staining for kappa light chains. These findings were consistent with light chain cast nephropathy (LCCN). Serum free light chains, serum immunofixation, urine protein electrophoresis, and urine immunofixation studies supported the renal biopsy diagnosis of LCCN. A bone marrow biopsy showed normal trilineage hematopoiesis and also revealed an atypical B cell population detected by flow cytometry. Pathology specimens from lesions in the distal small bowel were characteristic of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Chemoreduction therapy followed by chemotherapy was initiated for the DLBCL. Three months after initiation of chemotherapy, the patient's creatinine has improved by > 50%. The likely cause of her LCCN was the new diagnosis of a DLBCL. Other risk factors include her history of hypogammaglobulinemia, natural killer (NK) cell deficiency, community-acquired pneumonia, and prior follicular lymphoma. Our patient may be the youngest reported case of LCCN. Treatment of LCCN is based on treating the underlying clonal plasma cell or B cell proliferation, typically with chemotherapy."

The natural history of FL appears to have been favorably impacted by the introduction of rituximab after randomized clinical trials demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to standard chemotherapy induction has improved the overall survival. Yet, the disease is biologically and clinically heterogeneous with wide variations in outcomes for individual patients. The ability to accurately risk-stratify patients and then tailor therapy to the individual is an area of ongoing research. Historically, tumor grade, tumor burden, and the FL international prognostic index (version 1 and version 2) have been used to distinguish low-risk from high-risk patients. Biologic factors such as mutations in key genes can identify patients at high risk for poor outcomes to first-line therapy (mutational status of 7 genes [EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOX01, CREBBP, and CARD11] with Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index). More recently, the quality of the response to initial therapy, as measured by either PET imaging or by remission duration, has been show to identify individuals at high risk.

Single agent rituximab is also suggested as a good alternative. The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy has improved overall survival in advanced-stage FL patients with high tumor burden. The optimal chemotherapy to partner with rituximab might be CHOP or bendamustine. Rituximab maintenance after successful induction rituximab-based chemotherapy prolongs PFS. Recently, progression within 24 months of first-line chemotherapy has been established as a predictor of inferior outcome, with a 50% risk of death in 5 years.

UAB broadly defines a symptom complex of bladder emptying problems and does not indicate a specific pathology. Detrusor underactivity (DU) is a urodynamic diagnosis from pressure-flow studies. The correlation of UAB with DU remains to be precisely determined. METHODS:The presentations and subsequent discussion, leading to research recommendations during the Think Tank of the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society in Bristol, 2017, are summarized. RESULTS:To develop more specific individualized management strategies, the Think Tank panel proposed (i) that, since defining a single type of index patient to represent all UAB will not fulfill all clinical research needs, several index patients should be defined by phenotyping of patients with UAB, including, children, young men and women, elderly male and female patients with co-existing DU and detrusor overactivity, and neurological patients with UAB; (ii) prospective longitudinal studies to assess the natural history of UAB, in the different target populations, based on different UAB phenotypes, should be initiated; (iii) DU should be precisely defined by urodynamic parameters; and (iv) work to develop validated specific questionnaires combined with non-invasive tests for screening, diagnosis and follow up, needs to be continued. CONCLUSIONS:The precise relationship of UAB to DU remains to be defined. Phenotyping patients with UAB/DU, performing prospective trials of natural history, and developing symptom questionnaires and diagnostic investigations will improve our ability to identify and treat UAB/DU."

This deficiency has produced fragmentary knowledge regarding the natural history of this condition, healthcare needs, and the effects of the disease on caregivers. To remedy this deficiency, the Fragile X Clinic and Research Consortium was established to facilitate research. Through a collective effort, the Fragile X Clinic and Research Consortium developed the Fragile X Online Registry With Accessible Research Database (FORWARD) to facilitate multisite data collection. This report describes FORWARD and the way it can be used to improve health and quality of life of FXS patients and their relatives and caregivers. METHODS:FORWARD collects demographic information on individuals with FXS and their family members (affected and unaffected) through a 1-time registry form. The longitudinal database collects clinician- and parent-reported data on individuals diagnosed with FXS, focused on those who are 0 to 24 years of age, although individuals of any age can participate. RESULTS:The registry includes >2300 registrants (data collected September 7, 2009 to August 31, 2014). The longitudinal database includes data on 713 individuals diagnosed with FXS (data collected September 7, 2012 to August 31, 2014). Longitudinal data continue to be collected on enrolled patients along with baseline data on new patients. CONCLUSIONS:FORWARD represents the largest resource of clinical and demographic data for the FXS population in the United States.

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the natural course of small NF-PNETs. METHODS:We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with incidentally found small NF-PNETs (<20 mm) from 1999 to 2015. The patients who were recommended surveillance were included. RESULTS:There were 69 patients with small NF-PNETs with a mean size of 10.9 (standard deviation [SD], 3.1) mm. The average follow-up period was 52.2 (SD, 38.7) months. The changes in tumor size were as follows: increased (13.0%), sustained (84.1%), and decreased (2.9%). Eighteen were evaluated with grade 1 NF-PNETs and 1 with grade 2 among the obtained tissues. Thirteen patients underwent surgery after an average 32.9 (SD, 42.6) months later. There were 7 patients of Ia, 1 of Ib, 2 of IIa, and 1 of IIb according to the pathologic stages. Two patients received reoperation for recurrent tumors, and 2 patients showed distant metastasis after surgery, but no disease-related death occurred. CONCLUSIONS:Most of the small NF-PNETs did not increase in size and seldom showed metastasis. The wait-and-see strategy can be used for NF-PNETs less than 2 cm."

Within the subgroup of growing tumors, germline missense mutations were significantly associated with accelerated growth compared with nonsense and frameshift mutations.The majority of small NF-pNETs are stable at long-term follow-up, irrespective of the underlying MEN1 genotype. A subgroup of tumors is slowly growing but cannot be identified on clinical grounds. In this subgroup, tumors with missense mutations exhibited faster growth. Additional events appear necessary for pNETs to progress. Future studies should be aimed at identifying these molecular driving events, which could be used as potential biomarkers."

Our purpose is to analyze the role of GEP-NET in MEN1-related death, as well as the behavior of these lesions during follow-up.The study population consists of 77 patients diagnosed with MEN1 GEP-NET, regularly followed up since 1990. Extensive clinical data were prospectively recorded. Statistical analysis was performed both on the whole population of 77 patients and on two subgroups including patients who, during the long lasting study period, underwent GEP-NET surgery (50 pts) and who did not (27 pts), respectively.Twenty-five males (32.5%) and 52 females (67.5%) were enrolled. Sixty-four patients had MEN1 family history (83.1%), and genetic mutation was detected in 67 cases (87%). The mean age at GEP-NET diagnosis was 41.4 years (SD = 13.6); 16 patients (20.8%) had GEP-NET diagnosed before age 30 and 12 cases (15.6%) before 1996.

BACKGROUND:Pancreaticoduodenal tumors occur in almost all patients with MEN1 and are a major cause of death. The natural history and clinical outcome are poorly defined, and management is still controversial for small NF-PET. METHODS:Clinical outcome and tumor progression were analyzed in 46 patients with MEN1 with 2 cm or smaller NF-PET who did not have surgery at the time of initial diagnosis. Survival data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS:Forty-six patients with MEN1 were followed prospectively for 10.7 ± 4.2 (mean ± standard deviation) years. One patient was lost to follow-up and 1 died from a cause unrelated to MEN1. Twenty-eight patients had stable disease and 16 showed significant progression of pancreaticoduodenal involvement, indicated by increase in size or number of tumors, development of a hypersecretion syndrome, need for surgery (7 patients), and death from metastatic NF-PET (1 patient). The mean event-free survival was 13.9 ± 1.1 years after NF-PET diagnosis. At last follow-up, none of the living patients who had undergone surgery or follow-up had evidence of metastases on imaging studies. CONCLUSIONS:Our study shows that conservative management for patients with MEN1 with NF-PET of 2 cm or smaller is associated with a low risk of disease-specific mortality. The decision to recommend surgery to prevent tumor spread should be balanced with operative mortality and morbidity, and patients should be informed about the risk-benefit ratio of conservative versus aggressive management when the NF-PET represents an intermediate risk."

The morphological analysis of three previously undescribed specimens from the Pesciara deposit of Bolca revealed the existence of a new stingray taxon, †Lessiniabatis aenigmatica gen. et sp. nov., which is unique among the myliobatiform batoids in having the following unique combination of characters: low number of vertebrae posterior to the pelvic girdle (65-68); thoracolumbar synarcual extending backward beyond the pelvic girdle; tail extremely short not protruding from the posterior edge of the pectoral disc; radials proximally fused to each other; pelvic girdle extremely small and strongly arched; dorsal and caudal fins absent; tail stings and cartilaginous tail rod absent; and teeth of dasyatoid morphology with smooth enameloid surface. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that †Lessiniabatis gen. nov. is deeply nested within the benthic stingrays (Dasyatoidea) representing the sister to all dasyatids and potamotrygonids.

Previous work has suggested that the ridges and grooves on the occlusal surface are either the vestiges of teeth and their alveoli or were adaptations to increase shearing action during mastication. In addition, the distinctiveness of the dentaries has led to their use for species-level taxonomy, without a complete understanding of their variation through ontogeny. Here, we describe additional caenagnathid mandibles from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, Canada, and perform histological analyses to assess relative ontogenetic stage and the nature of the occlusal elaborations. The results show that the mandibular symphysis is synostosed early in ontogeny and does not accurately reflect ontogenetic stage in caenagnathids. In contrast, the presence of cyclical growth marks in a large specimen shows that mandibles can be used for relative histological maturity estimation. Histological features of the ridges of bone surrounding the lingual groove indicate that they are not the vestiges of tooth-bearing tissues and that caenagnathids did not lose their teeth through ontogeny as suggested in previous work. Instead, increased secondary remodeling in these structures is consistent with their use for food processing. Unexpectedly advanced maturity in a small specimen suggests that at least three caenagnathid species of varying body sizes coexisted in the Dinosaur Park Formation. These results stress the necessity of histological analysis when assessing maturity or ontogenetic trends in fossil material. Anat Rec, 303:918-934, 2020. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Chief among these features are two characters: the dentary-only mandible, and the tribosphenic molar with its triangulated upper cusps and lower talonid basin3-5. The flexible mandibular joint and the unfused symphysis of ancestral mammals-in combination with transformations of the adductor musculature and palate-are thought to have permitted greater mobility of each lower jaw, or hemimandible6,7. Following the appearance of precise dental occlusion near the origin of the mammalian crown8,9, therians evolved a tribosphenic molar with a craggy topography that is presumed to have been used to catch, cut and crush food. Here we describe the ancestral tribosphenic therian chewing stroke, as conserved in the short-tailed opossum Monodelphis domestica: it is a simple symmetrical sequence of lower tooth-row eversion and inversion during jaw opening and closing, respectively, enacted by hemimandibular long-axis rotation. This sequence is coupled with an eversion-inversion rotational grinding stroke. We infer that the ancestral therian chewing stroke relied heavily on long-axis rotation, including symmetrical eversion and inversion (inherited from the first mammaliaforms) as well as a mortar-and-pestle rotational grinding stroke that was inherited from stem therians along with the tribosphenic molar. The yaw-dominated masticatory cycle of primates, ungulates and other bunodont therians is derived; it is necessitated by a secondarily fused jaw symphysis, and permitted by the reduction of high, interlocking cusps10-12. The development of an efficient masticatory system-culminating in the tribosphenic apparatus-allowed early mammals to begin the process of digestion by shearing and crushing food into small boli instead of swallowing larger pieces in the reptilian manner, which necessitates a long, slow and wholly chemical breakdown. The vast diversity of mammalian teeth has emerged from the basic tribosphenic groundplan13."

(two species, one newly described), Lucascinus n. gen. (three species), Nasutoplax n. gen. (one species) and Stimpsoplax n. gen. (three species). The genera are distinguished primarily on features of the gonopod 1, interaction of the pleon with the thoracic sternal pleonal cavity, maxilliped 3, male cheliped, propodus-dactylus articulation of the ambulatory pereopods, and degree of fusion of the pleomeres. Species of Halicarcinus s.s. share a short trilobed rostrum, strongly curved gonopod 1 and free pleomeres. Some members of other genera may have a similar rostrum but typically have a long median projection with or without lateral angles or spines variously developed at the anterior margin of a supraocular eave. A lectotype of Hymenicus cookii Filhol, 1885 (now Halicarcinus cookii) is designated. A lectotype of Hymenosoma leachii Guérin, 1832, in Guérin-Méneville 1829-1837 (synonym of Halicarcinus planatus Fabricius, 1775) is selected in the interests of nomenclatural stability. Halicarcinus quoyi (H. Milne Edwards, 1853) is recognised as a senior synonym of the more widely used H. innominatus Richardson, 1949, which is itself a nomen nudum because it was erected without type designation. We also recognise Hymenicus marmoratus Chilton, 1882, as a junior synonym of Halicarcinus varius (Dana, 1851). Species of Rhynchoplax share a curved gonopod 1, falcate dactyli on pereopods 2-5 and fused pleomeres 3-4 in males and 3-5 in females. Species of Micas have a twisted gonopod 1 with the apex bent and only one or two subapical teeth on the dactylus of ambulatory legs. Culexisoma n. gen. is established for Halicarcinus ginowan Naruse & Komai, 2009, and a second species, Culexisoma niugini n. sp., from Papua New Guinea as type species. The genus is unique among these genera in having the male pleon not tightly engaging with the thoracic sternum, maxillipeds 3 not fully covering the buccal cavern and in having a strongly sexually dimorphic rostrum. Species of Lucascinus n. gen. share a male cheliped with 'nut-cracker'-like fingers and free pleomeres in both male and female. Nasutoplax n. gen. differs from others in the erect lateral profile of the rostrum and in gonopod 1 with an unusual subterminal spinulose projection on its posterior face. Stimpsoplax n. gen. has a gonopod 1 with a swollen base and a narrow strongly twisted distal part, tapering distally to a curved apex.

Screening for congenital hypothyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, biotinidase deficiency, and a few additional disorders was added by others over the years. However, a very large expansion of covered metabolic disorders eluded Guthrie despite his best efforts. This required a new screening technology, tandem mass spectrometry, which was not available until recently. Now, almost all developed newborn screening program use tandem mass spectrometry to cover the 29 metabolic disorders recommended for coverage by the American College of Medical Genetics and additional secondary disorders. The results have in some cases been spectacular in preventing or greatly reducing the burden of disease imposed by many of the screened disorders. However, expanded newborn screening has also brought problems that need to be addressed. These include lack of knowledge about the natural history of some of the disorders, absence of effective preventive therapy for others, identification of seemingly benign disorders or benign variants of severe disorders, and the resulting parental anxiety. To address these and other issues brought by expanded newborn screening, a national effort led by the American College of Medical Genetics has been developed. This effort known as the Newborn Screening Translational Research Network seeks to stimulate research, advocate pilot screening programs for proposed new additions to screening, and develop a protocol-based systematic long-term follow-up of infants identified in expanded screening programs.

The correlation and the prognostic impact of respiratory and heart impairment are poorly described. We aimed to describe the long-term cardiac and respiratory follow-up of these patients and to determine predictive factors of cardio-respiratory events and mortality in LGMD 2C and 2D. METHODS:We reviewed the charts of 34 LGMD patients, followed from 2005 to 2015, to obtain echocardiographic, respiratory function and sleep recording data. We considered respiratory events (acute respiratory failure, pulmonary sepsis, atelectasis or pneumothorax), cardiac events (acute heart failure, significant cardiac arrhythmia or conduction block, ischemic stroke) and mortality as outcomes of interest for the present analysis. RESULTS:A total of 21 patients had type 2C LGMD and 13 patients had type 2D. Median age was 30 years [IQR 24-38]. At baseline, median pulmonary vital capacity (VC) was 31% of predicted value [20-40]. Median maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) was 31 cmH2O [IQR 20.25-39.75]. Median maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) was 30 cm H2O [20-36]. Median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 55% [45-64] with 38% of patients with LVEF <50%. Over a median follow-up of 6 years, we observed 38% respiratory events, 14% cardiac events and 20% mortality. Among baseline characteristics, LVEF and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) were associated with mortality, whilst respiratory parameters (VC, MIP, MEP) and the need for home mechanical ventilation (HMV) were associated with respiratory events. CONCLUSION:In our cohort of severely respiratory impaired type 2C and 2D LGMD, respiratory morbidity was high. Cardiac dysfunction was frequent in particular in LGMD 2C and had an impact on long-term mortality. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02501083."

Upper abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite, loss of weight, and anemia were the principal symptoms. Preoperative hypoproteinemia was documented in two patients. Gross findings consisted of a circumscribed area of giant folds, well demarcated from the surrounding normal-appearing mucosa, located predominantly in the corpus in six patients and predominantly in the antrum in four patients. Histologically they corresponded to an increase in the epithelial cell mass principally of mucous cells with elongated and sometimes cystically dilated foveolae, accompanied by a mild inflammatory infiltrate. This so-called localized form of hyperplastic gastropathy has been known since the first description of the disease but has gained relatively little attention in the literature. However, its recognition seems diagnostically important and pathogenetically interesting. Etiology, pathogenesis, and the natural history are mostly unknown. Five of the 11 patients had concomitant adenocarcinoma of the stomach. In four of them the carcinoma was not located within but outside the area of hyperplasia. Because of that and because of a rather unusual accumulation of other tumors of the gastrointestinal tract in these patients, it is suggested that localized hyperplastic gastropathy could be an indicator of an increased risk for gastrointestinal tumors in general more than a possibly premalignant lesion by itself."

Insulinomas are mostly benign, responsible for incapacitating symptoms despite medical treatment, and should ideally be treated by parenchyma sparing resection, mainly enucleation. Conversely, symptoms of gastrinomas are efficiently treated medically but their resection needs an oncological approach. Nonfunctioning PNETs are more and more frequently and incidentally discovered.

They have a better overall prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, all commonly used classification systems reflect a separation between more indolent, well-differentiated tumors and far more aggressive poorly differentiated types that behave clinically more like small-cell carcinoma of the lung. Objective.To present the case of a 62-year-old man with an aggressive pancreatic NET, with liver, splenic and bone metastases who underwent multidisciplinary treatment including several lines of chemotherapy, somatostatin analogs and radiotherapy. Methods and Results.The patient is a smoker and an occasional drinker, known with type two diabetes mellitus (DM), receiving insulin therapy. He was diagnosed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in January 2015 with a locally invasive pancreatic body mass, intraabdominal adenopathies and liver nodules, suggestive of metastases. Histopathological diagnosis was obtained through liver biopsy: neuroendocrine tumor with a 10-15% Ki67 proliferation index. Palliative chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and capecitabine was started in March 2015. In June 2015, Sandostatin LAR was added. In March 2016, he had progressive disease. Subsequently, in September 2016, bone metastasis was found within the T10 vertebra. He underwent radiotherapy for multiple bone metastases in February 2017. Progressive disease was again found during a CT examination in May 2017. His performance status has gradually worsened since then and he died in July 2017.

Leucocyte acid b-glucosidase activity is mandatory for establishing the diagnosis of Gaucher disease; molecular testing can help identify patients at risk of neuronopathic disease. Enzyme replacement therapy for type 1 and type 3 Gaucher disease is the standard of care. Best outcomes are achieved by early initiation of therapy before onset of irreversible complications. However, in setting of progressive neurological symptoms such as seizures and or/ neuroregression, ERT is not recommended, as it cannot cross the blood brain barrier. The recommendations herein are for diagnosis, for initiation of therapy, therapeutic goals, monitoring and follow up of patients. We highlight that prevention of recurrence of the disease through genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis is essential in India, due to uniformly severe phenotypes encountered in our population."

Appropriate investigations include a screening magnetic resonance imaging scan, neurologic evaluation, and serial clinical observations for the development of cutaneous melanoma. A variety of nonsurgical and surgical options are possible for the treatment of giant congenital melanocytic nevi. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed to gather all pertinent articles from 1955 to 2005. RESULTS: Giant congenital melanocytic nevi are a difficult diagnostic and reconstructive challenge, requiring careful preoperative evaluation, staged surgical excision, and lifelong patient monitoring and follow-up. With proper treatment, patients can expect a decreased risk of melanoma, with the possibility for early detection and cure of melanoma, amelioration of symptoms, improved aesthetics and psychosocial sequelae, and maintenance of function. CONCLUSION: The plastic surgeon treating these challenging lesions must have a solid working knowledge of the disease's histology, its natural history and complications, and the options for treatment."

A thirteen-year review],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15503950,"Tumors diagnosed during the first month of life are infrequent: 0.5 to 2% of all childhood neoplasms. This is an interesting group of tumors because their type, relative incidence, natural history and response to treatment differ from those seen in older children. AIM: To contribute the experience of our institution in congenital tumors the last 13 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The records of all neonates (< 31 days old) diagnosed with solid tumors since January 1990 to December 2002 have been retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven neonates have been diagnosed with tumors in the last 13 years. Thirteen patients (48%) were prenatally diagnosed. Nine babies were diagnosed at the initial neonatal exam (40% of those diagnosedd after birth). Neuroblastoma was the commonest tumor (10 cases, 37%), of which 4 were stage I, 4 stage IV-S and 2 stage III. There were 8 teratomas (3 sacrocoxigeal, 1 retroperitoneal, 1 in the CNS, 1 orbitary and two oronasal), two hepatic tumors (1 hepatoblastoma, 1 hemangioendothelioma, two CNS tumors, two giant nevus (one on a hamartoma), and one each Wilms tumor, infantile fibrosarcoma and myofibroblastic tumor. Treatment was surgical resection alone in 17 cases (68%) and surgery + chemotherapy in 8 (32%) (5 neuroblastomas, one CNS tumor, one Wilms tumor and one presacral teratoma who developed a yolk sac tumor); 3 patients died (11%): one at surgery, one of tumoural airway obstruction at birth and one with craniopharyngioma. Among the 14 tumors that were initially not malignant, two can be locally agressive, one was an immature teratoma, the giant nevus with hamartoma developed in situ melanoma, the other nevus had meningeal melanosis with hydrocephalus, and one mature presacral teratoma developed a yolk sac tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of congenital tumors is performed earlier in recent years due to the wide use of prenatal ultrasound. Their natural history is more benign than in other age groups, except for CNS tumors and very large or obstructing tumors. The histological patern is not determinant of the outcome. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice, most cases not need adjuvant chemotherapy. We ought to pass this message on to our colleagues in prenatal diagnosis, so parents get reliable information."

The thrombosis could affect the microvessels, and also the large vessels, including even less usual territories (suprahepatic veins, porta vein, pulmonary vein). There are many factors contributing to thrombosis in myeloproliferative chronic disorders--the associated comorbidities, the numeric alterations of blood elements and also the disorders of the platelet's function. Thus, there were described quantitative and qualitative anomalies of platelet's receptors: GP Ib, GP IIb/IIIa, GP IV, GP VI, thrombopoietin receptor of the platelet cMPL, the increase of platelet activation; the increase of P selectin and thrombospondin and the increase on GP IIb/IIIa expression--they were all correlated with thrombosis. An important role has been attributed to JAK2 mutation, which affects the platelet receptor for thrombopoietin cMPL. Regarding the hemorrhage in chronic myeloproliferative syndrome, it is favored by many disorders in platelet's function, such as: the decrease of von Willebrand factor's receptor of the platelet, which leads to acquired Bernard Soulier syndrome; quantitative and qualitative disorders of dense granules of the platelet, decrease of the secretion and platelet aggregation after epinephrine, ADP and collagen stimulation.

Ideally, testing is done in animals with the analogous human disease to provide essential safety information, estimates of the correct starting dose and dose response (pharmacokinetics) and measures of efficacy (pharmacodynamics) that guide the design of human trials. For nearly seven decades, canine models of hemophilia, von Willebrand disease and other inherited bleeding disorders have not only informed our understanding of the natural history and pathophysiology of these disorders but also guided the development of novel therapeutics for use in humans and dogs.

Such antibodies are produced after transfusion or pregnancy when the patient's immune system comes into contact with normal platelets. Despite many reports of anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies in GT patients, there is no consensus pertaining to their frequency, their long-term evolution in the circulation, or their formation in relation to either (i) the extent of the αIIbβ3 deficiency in the patient's platelets or (ii) the nature of the genetic defect (ITGA2B or ITGB3 genes). Antibody screening was performed on a large series of 24 GT patients in South-West France dividing the patients into two cohorts: (i) 16 patients with the French gypsy mutation (c.1544 + 1G>A) within ITGA2B that gives platelets totally lacking αIIbβ3 and (ii) 8 patients carrying other defects of ITGA2B or ITGB3 with different expression levels of αIIbβ3. Our results confirm that patients with premature termination mutations resulting in platelets lacking αIIbβ3 are the most susceptible to form isoantibodies, a finding that may be useful in deciding the choice of therapy between platelet transfusion and the use of recombinant factor VIIa (FVIIa)."

STUDY DESIGN:An online patient questionnaire was completed by 628 patients with clinically diagnosed SWS and/or a port-wine birthmark over a 19-year period. Statistical analysis focused on seizures as a primary outcome measure, as well as associated neurologic, ophthalmologic, and dermatologic attributes to understand some of the natural history of the disorder. RESULTS:The majority (92%) of patients had a port-wine birthmark, and 60% of the patients had neurologic symptoms, including seizures and stroke-like episodes. Glaucoma was present in 48% of the patients. Other common symptoms included behavioral (46%) and hearing (or vestibular) disorders (24%). Delayed diagnosis of SWS beyond 1 year after presentation of initial symptoms occurred in 16% of the patients, with 68% having clear preexisting comorbidities, especially headaches. Birthmarks on the forehead and scalp were associated with seizures (P < .001), whereas bilaterality of birthmarks was not. Only 49% of patients being treated for epilepsy were free of seizures. CONCLUSIONS:Seizures and glaucoma were the primary drivers for a diagnosis of SWS in patients with delayed diagnosis, and hearing (or vestibular) and behavioral problems were also prevalent. The diagnosis of SWS was delayed when the predominant symptom was headache. Seizure control was quite poor in many patients with SWS. Our findings highlight an important need for detailed, longitudinal data to improve our understanding of SWS and develop better treatment strategies for patients with this disorder."

METHODS:Patients with POAG in the West Indies Glaucoma Laser Study (WIGLS) had 360-degree SLT after medication washout. No antiinflammatory therapy was used after SLT. Nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular lens opacities were graded through dilated pupils using the Lens Opacification Classification System III (LOCS III) at baseline and 12, 24, and 36 months after SLT, with the grader masked to all previous values after baseline assessment.

One and a half years ago she was diagnosed with right eye dry eye and glaucoma and had received treatment according to this diagnosis. However, none of the treatments led to any improvement in redness and headache. Physical examination revealed dry eye and severe corkscrew hyperaemia with dilated vessels in the right eye. The results of fundoscopic examination of both eyes were normal. After we considered that the symptoms may be related to abnormal intracranial vessels, computed tomography angiography and venography (CTA + CTV) were performed, and the results showed an arteriovenous malformation in the right parietal-occipital area in the brain. The AVM was definitively located by further examination with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). After AVM endovascular embolism treatment, the conjunctival congestion of the right eye was significantly relieved, and the intraocular pressure decreased to normal. CONCLUSION:In clinical practice, when corkscrew hyperaemia accompanied by neurological symptoms is found, cerebral vascular diseases might be considered. In this case, the ophthalmologist's diagnosis should combine disease history and imaging examination."

Screening of inborn errors, karyotyping, chromosomal breakage rates and DNA mutational studies with direct sequencing of LMNA, ERCC8 and ZMPSTE24 genes were also performed.Generalized lipodystrophy was noted in all patients except for regions such as the cheeks, hands and feet. All cases had failure to thrive, microcephaly, ear dysplasia, laryngomalacia, hearing impairment, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, constipation, abnormal dentition, dermatitis/acrodermatitis enteropathica, hyperpigmentation of the skin, very low insulin-like growth factor I levels with delayed bone age, relative hypolipidemia, initial camptodactyly/joint contracture, progressive kyphoscoliosis, osteoporosis with loose joints, ventriculomegaly, and generalized organic aciduria. Other findings included inguinal hernia, hypothyroidism or persistent hyperthyrotropinemia, cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, growth hormone deficiency, cloudy cornea with congenital glaucoma, neonatal teeth, cardiac defects, basal ganglia calcification and seizure disorder. These patients with NPS did not show hyperinsulinemia or dyslipidemia. Their karyotypes were all normal, while the chromosomal breakage test showed markedly increased breakage rates in four patients.

The data were entered to the database in order to create a national AGel amyloidosis patient registry (FIN-GAR).A total of 227 patients, 156 women and 71 men, participated in the study. The women in our registry noticed their first symptoms at the median age of 39 years versus 43 years for men (p = 0.01). At the age in which the diagnosis was made there was a trend to be observed between men and women (women: 39 years versus men: 43 years, p = 0.053). Corneal lattice dystrophy was diagnosed in significantly younger women than men (median ages 41 versus 49 years, respectively, p = 0.01). Of other ophthalmological manifestations, corneal ulcer, impaired vision and glaucoma were all diagnosed at least 5 years earlier in women, although differences were not statistically significant. Ophthalmological manifestations, such as dry eyes and corneal ulcer; dermatological signs, such as blepharochalasis, and also neurological symptoms, such as myokymia and carpal tunnel syndrome, were more prevalent among women.In the largest so far available study on AGel amyloidosis we show that women developed symptoms and signs of AGel amyloidosis at younger age. Especially eye-related problems occurred earlier and together with nerve and skin manifestations, the characteristic clinical triad in AGel amyloidosis, were more common in women. However, a clear limitation of our study was a selection bias caused by a significant underrepresentation of men in the study population."

Spontaneous dislocation of a transparent natural lens is extremely rare, especially dislocation of the anterior eye chamber. We report a case of spontaneous dislocation of the transparent natural lens to the anterior eye chamber in a patient who had no history of eye injuries. CASE OUTLINE:The patient was a 17-year-old boy. Lens dislocation was spontaneous, and the patient presented for ophthalmological consultation due to a sudden vision impairment of the left eye. Biomicroscopic examination verified that the transparent lens was in the anterior chamber, and it was spherophakia of lesser diameter; there were no signs of increased intraocular pressure, as typically expected in lens dislocation to the anterior chamber. The patient was operated on in general anaesthesia. Surgery involved intracapsular extraction of the dislocated lens through a corneoscleral incision. CONCLUSION:This case report shows that a spontaneous dislocation of the natural lens may occur in younger people. The dislocated spherophakic lens to the anterior eye chamber did not contribute to the rise of the intraocular pressure and development of acute glaucoma. The acute glaucoma resulted from the pilocarpine narrowing of the pupil due to pupillary block. The intracapsular instrumental extraction of the dislocated transparent lens from the anterior chamber was successfully completed through a corneoscleral incision."

Her facies was flat with a very low nasal bridge and a vascular nevus covering the glabellar area, micrognathia and high arched palate. The limbs appeared shorter proximally and a radiologic skeletal survey revealed dumbbell shaped long bones, flattened acetabular roofs, posterior defects in the vertebral bodies in the thoracic region, platyspondyly. Seen in follow-up at nine weeks, 14 months and 24 months, after several goniotomies which successfully controlled her intraocular pressure, she presented with high myopia, moderate hypotonia and hyperextensible joints. The midfacial hypoplasia persisted, but the skeletal X-rays showed that the long bones seem to acquire a more elongated appearance. Her mental and motor development, although five to nine months delayed, reflected regular progress. The clinical findings in this patient suggest that she belongs in the heterogeneous category of ophthalmo-arthropathies described by Weissenbacher and Zweymüller and which is thought to be the neonatal expression of the Stickler syndrome. The need for early recognition of this syndrome and a better grasp of the natural history of these disorders are emphasized in order to support the hypothesis of a continuum of manifestations of the hereditary arthro-ophthalmopathies."

Case Description:Two patients, respectively, 28 years old at the 14th week of gestation with a thalamic GBM and 38 years old at the 28th week of gestation with fronto-mesial GBM. Patients and their relatives were deeply informed about the natural history of GBM and potential risks and benefits of surgery, radiotherapy (XRT), and chemotherapy (CTX) for both, mother and fetus. The first patient's will was to preserve her fetus from any related, even minimal, risk of XRT, and CTX until safe delivery despite progression of GBM, accepting only surgery (tumor debulking and shunting of hydrocephalus). The second one asked to deliver the baby as soon as possible (despite the risks of prematurity) to receive the standard treatments of GBM. The two patients survived, respectively, 16 and 46 months after delivery. The first patient's son is in good clinical conditions; the second one suffered problems linked to prematurity. Conclusions:Standard treatment of GBM in a pregnant woman could improve the mother's survival but can expose the fetus to several potential risks. Ethically, relatives should understand that mother has anyway a poor prognosis and, at the same time, fetus prognosis depends on mother's condition and therapy. It is not possible to warrant absence of risk for both. Considering the absence of guidelines and the relatively poor current data available about management of GBM in a pregnant woman, after a deep explanation of the situation, we think that the will of the mother and her relatives should prevail."

This is partly due to considerable inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity. Changes in the cellular energy-producing mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (MRC) activities are a hallmark of glioblastoma relative to the normal brain, and associate with differential survival outcomes. Targeting MRC complexes with drugs can also facilitate anti-glioblastoma activity. Whether mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encode several components of the MRC contribute to these phenomena remains underexplored. We identified a germ-line mtDNA mutation (m. 14798T > C), enriched in glioblastoma relative to healthy controls, that causes an amino acid substitution F18L within the core mtDNA-encoded cytochrome b subunit of MRC complex III. F18L is predicted to alter corresponding complex III activity, and sensitivity to complex III-targeting drugs. This could in turn alter reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell behaviour and, consequently, patient outcomes. Here we show that, despite a heterogeneous mitochondrial background in adult glioblastoma patient biopsy-derived cell cultures, the F18L substitution associates with alterations in individual MRC complex activities, in particular a 75% increase in MRC complex II_III activity, and a 34% reduction in CoQ10, the natural substrate for MRC complex III, levels. Downstream characterisation of an F18L-carrier revealed an 87% increase in intra-cellular ROS, an altered cellular distribution of mitochondrial-specific ROS, and a 64% increased sensitivity to clomipramine, a repurposed MRC complex III-targeting drug. In patients, F18L-carriers that received the current standard of care treatment had a poorer prognosis than non-carriers (373 days vs. 415 days, respectively). Single germ-line mitochondrial mutations could predispose individuals to differential prognoses, and sensitivity to mitochondrial targeted drugs. Thus, F18L, which is present in blood could serve as a useful non-invasive biomarker for the stratification of patients into prognostically relevant groups, one of which requires a lower dose of clomipramine to achieve clinical effect, thus minimising side-effects."

The brain is very sensitive to oxygen and glucose deprivation and it is the only organ that cannot be either transplanted or entirely removed. Furthermore, many clues and recent indirect experimental evidence indicate that the micro-infiltration of the whole brain parenchyma occurs in very early stages of tumor bulk growth or likely even before. As a consequence, the primary glioblastoma (IDH-wildtype, WHO 2016) is the only tumor where the malignant (i.e. distantly infiltrating the organ of origin) and deadly (i.e. leading cause to patient's death) phases coincide and overlap in one single phase of its natural history. To date, the prognosis of optimally treated glioblastoma patients remains dismal despite recent fundamental progress in neurosurgical techniques which are enabling better maximal safe resection and survival outcome. Intratumor variegated heterogeneity of glioblastoma bulk due to trunk-branch evolution and very early micro-infiltration and settlement of neoplastic cells in the entire brain parenchyma are the reasons for resistance to current therapeutic treatments. With the aim of future innovative and effective therapies, this paper deals with the unique glioblastoma features, the appropriate research methods as well as the strategies to follow to overcome current causes of resistance."

Therefore, the natural history of GBM metastases remains elusive. The identification of clinical factors promoting GBM metastases may help elucidate the mechanisms of tumor cell invasion in the brain. The aims of this study were to perform a meta-analysis evaluating the survival, characteristics, prognostic factors, and predictors of treatment outcome in patients with metastatic GBM and describe a case of metastatic extracranial GBM. METHODS:We report the case of a patient diagnosed with GBM metastatic to the lungs and the results of a meta-analysis of 114 other cases of metastatic GBM identified through a MEDLINE and BIREME search. RESULTS:The mean age of the patients was 38.2±16.1 years and 70.4% were male. The time elapsed between the identification of the metastasis and death was significantly increased in patients undergoing surgery (p=0.019), whereas the time from the diagnosis of the primary tumor to death was significantly increased in patients receiving radiation therapy (p=0.050). The time elapsed from metastasis to death and diagnosis to death was significantly longer in patients receiving chemotherapy (p<0.001 and p=0.027, respectively). The liver was the metastatic site associated with the shortest time elapsed from diagnosis to death (p=0.024). CONCLUSIONS:In GBM, surgical resection is important in reducing the risk of metastasis, and chemotherapy and radiation therapy help to prolong survival in metastatic GBM.

In this study, we examine patient perspectives on functional outcome domains and report the prevalence of impairments rates using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and Neuro-QOL item banks as measures of HRQOL. Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected dataset involving 79 glioma patients reveals that quality of life concerns are the most important consideration behind making decisions about treatment in 80.7% of patients. The prevalence of functional impairment by PROMIS and NEURO-QOL assessment is high, ranging from 28.6% in the physical function domain to 43.9% in the cognitive function domain. Pain and anxiety related to physical decline is higher in LGG patients compared to HGG patients. Aphasia severity also impacts HRQOL.

It is now well established that not only are the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of glucocorticoids and sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone) closely related but that the receptors for these hormones are part of a supergene family of receptors which include (in addition to these hormone receptors) the mineralocorticoid receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptors, and vitamin D receptors. This suggests a complex network of steroid hormones and receptors for the control and integration of a multitude of physiologic functions at a systemic level. The immune system seems to be tightly integrated into this homeostatic neuroendocrine regulatory network. The neurophysiologic and biochemical events that promote successful adaptation during stressful situations are now identified for illnesses that seem to occur as a result of or are associated with dysregulation of the stress response. One difficulty in interpreting the mechanisms of HPA axis dysfunction in autoimmune-inflammatory syndromes arises from the plasticity of the hormonal systems involved. Levels of hormones produced and receptors reset rapidly with changes in the hormonal milieu (deficiency or excess) and have likely changed during the course of the chronic immune disorder. This, in turn, is further confounded by the pleomorphic natural history of most autoimmune-inflammatory diseases such as SS. The levels of sex hormones and their receptors are tightly linked to HPA axis function. It may be that significant changes in the estrogen-to-androgen ratio or the ratio of their receptors alter the activity of steroid-sensitive cells such as the individual immune cells or epithelial cells, thus providing a means for endocrine regulation of the immune response in SS. Studies in the closely related disorder RA support this hypothesis. Taken together, adrenal and gonadal steroid hormone deficiency plus elevated PRL levels probably greatly facilitate cellular immunity in SS patients. This hypothesis in SS is supported by a growing body of data indicating that RA develops as a consequence of a deficiency in adrenal and gonadal steroid hormone production. It is noteworthy that the findings in female SS patients indicated a central deficiency in all three neuroendocrine axes: adrenal, gonadal, and thyroid. At present, it is not clear if any one system plays a primary role in the expression of the disease. Rather, it is likely that the net effect involves the synergistic and antagonistic effects of multiple hormones, making the specific effects of individual hormones difficult to discern."

Despite this, little is known about the mechanisms of GC resistance in patients with HES. OBJECTIVE:To explore the aetiology of GC resistance in HES. METHODS:Clinical data and samples from 26 patients with HES enrolled on a prospective study of GC responsiveness and 23 patients with HES enrolled on a natural history study of eosinophilia for whom response to GC was known were analysed retrospectively. Expression of GC receptor isoforms was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR in purified eosinophils. Serum cytokine levels were quantified by suspension array assay in multiplex. RESULTS:Despite an impaired eosinophil response to GC after 7 days of treatment, the expected rise in absolute neutrophil count was seen in 7/7 GC-resistant patients, suggesting that GC resistance in HES is not a global phenomenon. Eosinophil mRNA expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) isoforms (α, β, and P) was similar between GC-sensitive (n = 20) and GC-resistant (n = 9) patients with HES. Whereas geometric mean serum levels were also comparable between GC-r (n = 11) and GC-s (n = 19) for all cytokines tested, serum IL-5 levels were >100 pg/mL only in GC-r patients. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:These data suggest that the mechanism of GC resistance in HES is not due to a global phenomenon affecting all lineages, but may be due, at least in some patients, to impairment of eosinophil apoptosis by increased levels of IL-5."

The clinical spectrum of the condition is broad, ranging from completely asymptomatic to severe hyperandrogenism and/or mineralocorticoid excess. The molecular basis of glucocorticoid resistance has been ascribed to mutations in the human glucocorticoid receptor-alpha (hGRalpha) gene, which impair one or more of the molecular mechanisms of GR action, thus altering tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids. We identified a new case of generalized glucocorticoid resistance in a young woman who presented with a long-standing history of fatigue, anxiety, hyperandrogenism, and hypertension. The disease was caused by a novel, heterozygous mutation (T-->C) at nucleotide position 2318 (exon 9) of the hGRalpha gene, which resulted in substitution of leucine by proline at amino acid position 773 in the ligand-binding domain of the receptor. We systematically investigated the molecular mechanisms through which the natural hGRalphaL773P mutant impaired glucocorticoid signal transduction. Compared with the wild-type hGRalpha, hGRalphaL773P demonstrated a 2-fold reduction in the ability to transactivate the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, exerted a dominant negative effect on the wild-type receptor, had a 2.6-fold reduction in the affinity for ligand, showed delayed nuclear translocation (30 vs. 12 min), and, although it preserved its ability to bind to DNA, displayed an abnormal interaction with the GR-interacting protein 1 coactivator in vitro. We conclude that the carboxyl terminus of the ligand-binding domain of hGRalpha is extremely important in conferring transactivational activity by altering multiple functions of this composite transcription factor."

The first very important lesson in the ""primer"" is: there is no such thing as a generic monkey. Brand names (ie, species and subspecies) are important. Several taxonomic groups of primates are used in research including: prosimians, such as galagos and lemurs; New World monkeys, particularily marmosets; Old World monkeys, especially macaques and baboons; and the chimpanzee, an African ape. Differences between taxa are exemplified by the glucocorticoid resistance of New World monkeys compared to Old World monkeys, which results in the requirement for Vitamin D3 and their high circulating levels of steroids such as cortisone and progesterone. Differences in ovarian histology between Old and New World monkeys probably relate to steroid receptor biology as well. There are also variations in disease manifestations, even among closely related primate species such as rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (cynos). For example type D retrovirus infection is accompanied by lymphomas in cynos, but not rhesus. The second important lesson in this ""primer"" is: ""not test article related"" does not always mean ""normal.""

Moreover, the ratios of incremental area of response ACTH/cortisol and beta-endorphin/cortisol after 1 microg/kg ovine-corticotrophin-releasing hormone (o-CRH) positively correlated with percent increase of NK cell activity after rIL-2 (P<0.01). Data indicate that patients with mild cognitive impairment and short history of sDAT show abnormal responsiveness of NK cell activity to physiological modifiers while maintaining normal spontaneous activity. Furthermore, data are compatible with partial glucocorticoid resistance at the immune level. Progressing sDAT longitudinal studies are needed to address: i) the clinical applicability of these abnormalities as prognostic factors; ii) the role played by pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides and adrenal androgens in the control of NK cell activity."

However, despite dietary treatment, long-term liver complications emerge. We present a GSD III liver natural history study in children to better understand changes in hepatic parameters with age. METHODS:We reviewed clinical, biochemical, histological, and radiological data in pediatric patients with GSD III, and performed a literature review of GSD III hepatic findings. RESULTS:Twenty-six patients (median age 12.5 years, range 2-22) with GSD IIIa (n = 23) and IIIb (n = 3) were enrolled in the study. Six of seven pediatric patients showed severe fibrosis on liver biopsy (median [range] age: 1.25 [0.75-7] years). Markers of liver injury (aminotransferases), dysfunction (cholesterol, triglycerides), and glycogen storage (glucose tetrasaccharide, Glc4) were elevated at an early age, and decreased significantly thereafter (p < 0.001). Creatine phosphokinase was also elevated with no significant correlation with age (p = 0.4). CONCLUSION:Liver fibrosis can occur at an early age, and may explain the decrease in aminotransferases and Glc4 with age. Our data outlines the need for systematic follow-up and specific biochemical and radiological tools to monitor the silent course of the liver disease process."

The purpose of this study was to delineate the natural history of the condition and identify genotype-phenotype correlations that might be helpful in predicting the course of the disease in individual patients.A cohort of 21 patients with juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis, 15 with the Tay-Sachs variant and 6 with the Sandhoff variant, was studied prospectively in 2 centers. Our experience was compared with previously published reports on 134 patients. Information about clinical features, beta-hexosaminidase enzyme activity, and mutation analysis was collected.In our cohort of patients, the mean (+/-SD) age of onset of symptoms was 5.3 +/- 4.1 years, with a mean follow-up time of 8.4 years. The most common symptoms at onset were gait disturbances (66.7%), incoordination (52.4%), speech problems (28.6%), and developmental delay (28.6%). The age of onset of gait disturbances was 7.1 +/- 5.6 years. The mean time for progression to becoming wheelchair-bound was 6.2 +/- 5.5 years. The mean age of onset of speech problems was 7.0 +/- 5.6 years, with a mean time of progression to anarthria of 5.6 +/- 5.3 years. Muscle wasting (10.6 +/- 7.4 years), proximal weakness (11.1 +/- 7.7 years), and incontinence of sphincters (14.6 +/- 9.7 years) appeared later in the course of the disease. Psychiatric disturbances and neuropathy were more prevalent in patients with the Sandhoff variant than in those with the Tay-Sachs variant. However, dysphagia, sphincter incontinence, and sleep problems occurred earlier in those with the Tay-Sachs variant. Cerebellar atrophy was the most common finding on brain MRI (52.9%). The median survival time among the studied and reviewed patients was 14.5 years. The genotype-phenotype correlation revealed that in patients with the Tay-Sachs variant, the presence of R178H and R499H mutations was predictive of an early onset and rapidly progressive course. The presence of either G269S or W474C mutations was associated with a later onset of symptoms along with a more slowly progressive disease course.Juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis is clinically heterogeneous, not only in terms of age of onset and clinical features but also with regard to the course of the disease. In general, the earlier the onset of symptoms, the more rapidly the disease progresses. The Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff variants differed somewhat in the frequency of specific clinical characteristics. Speech deterioration progressed more rapidly than gait abnormalities in both the Tay-Sachs variant and Sandhoff variant groups. Among patients with the Tay-Sachs variant, the HEXA genotype showed a significant correlation with the clinical course."

Less frequently, liver findings may include vascular changes and, rarely, severe liver disease. Although previous studies on children and adolescents suggest a frequency of LFT abnormalities of up to 60%, less is known about the age at onset and natural history. METHODS:We report a now 19-year-old young woman with Turner syndrome mosaicism with elevated transaminase levels first detected at the age of 2 years. We also present a retrospective analysis of 179 girls and women followed in the MassGeneral Hospital Turner Syndrome Clinic. RESULTS:In the index case, the severity of liver function test abnormalities fluctuated without complete resolution from 2 to 18 years of age. In the full cohort of 179 patients, when lab results were available, elevated ALT levels occurred in 16 (11%) subjects of all ages, and in 5 (10%) patients ≤18 years of age. Significant and persistent ALT elevations occurred in 2 patients <10 years of age. CONCLUSION:The updated Clinical Practice Guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome recommend annual liver function tests throughout the lifespan, starting at the age of 10 years. Based on our data showing persistent elevation of at least one liver enzyme, we recommend a prospective and more comprehensive study of liver function in younger patients with Turner syndrome. An improved estimate of prevalence could better inform age-adjusted guidelines."

Recently introduced pathogens initially induce resistance responses, but natural selection favors the development of tolerance, allowing for a commensal relationship to evolve. Mycosis by Pseudogymnoascus destructans, causing white-nose syndrome (WNS) in Nearctic hibernating bats, has resulted in population declines since 2006. The pathogen, which spread from Europe, has infected species of Palearctic Myotis for a longer period. We compared ecologically relevant responses to the fungal infection in the susceptible Nearctic M. lucifugus and less susceptible Palearctic M. myotis, to uncover factors contributing to survival differences in the two species. Samples were collected from euthermic bats during arousal from hibernation, a naturally occurring phenomenon, during which transcriptional responses are activated. We compared the whole-transcriptome responses in wild bats infected with P. destructans hibernating in their natural habitat. Our results show dramatically different local transcriptional responses to the pathogen between uninfected and infected samples from the two species. Whereas we found 1526 significantly upregulated or downregulated transcripts in infected M. lucifugus, only one transcript was downregulated in M. myotis. The upregulated response pathways in M. lucifugus include immune cell activation and migration, and inflammatory pathways, indicative of an unsuccessful attempt to resist the infection. In contrast, M. myotis appears to tolerate P. destructans infection by not activating a transcriptional response. These host-microbe interactions determine pathology, contributing to WNS susceptibility, or commensalism, promoting tolerance to fungal colonization during hibernation that favors survival."

The control group included 11 healthy girls with no hormonal disorders. A medical history focused on AD and immunity disorders was taken from all participants. The levels of: immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgM, total lymphocytes, lymphocytes subpopulations CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, natural killer cells, Treg cells (CD4+ CD25+ CD127- FOXP3+), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-10, transforming growth factor-β), anti-nuclear antibodies, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 Abs), anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO Ab), and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG Ab) autoantibodies were determined in each participant.The mean age and BMI in the TS group and in controls were comparable (11.9 ± 4.1 vs. 12.5 ± 4.0 years; 19.2 ± 3.4 vs. 19.7 ± 4.6, p > 0.05).

SUMMARY ANSWER: Immediate gonadectomy, long-term hormone therapy and psychological care are suggested to be the optimal management for older phenotypic female patients with Y chromosome or Y-derived sequences. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Phenotypic female patients with Y chromosome or Y-derived sequences are at increasing risk of developing gonadal tumors with age. Early diagnosis and safe guidelines of management for these patients are needed. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: One hundred and two phenotypic women with Y chromosome or Y-derived sequences were included in a straightforward, retrospective-observational study conducted over a period of 26 years from January 1985 to November 2010. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING AND METHODS: Patients aged 16-34 years presenting to our Academic Department of Gynecology with symptoms of disorders of sex development were subjected to history taking, hormonal evaluation, conventional cytogenetic analysis, PCR, histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Features of the gonads were examined and the outcome of prophylactic gonadectomy evaluated. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Among the patients recruited in our study, 48 patients (47.1%) were diagnosed with complete/partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS/PAIS) (46XY), 33 cases (32.4%) with gonadal dysgenesis (46XY) and the remaining subjects (20.1%) with mixed gonadal dysgenesis (with sex chromosome structural abnormalities). The total incidence of malignancy was 17.6%. Seventeen patients (16.7%) had gonadoblastoma, while one patient (1.0%) with gonadal dysgenesis had dysgerminoma. Gonadoblastoma were observed in 2/21 patients with sex chromosome structural abnormalities (9.5%), 3/33 patients with gonadal dysgenesis (9.1%), 9/30 patients with CAIS (30.0%) and 3/18 patients with PAIS (16.7%). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Selection bias in this cohort study may affect data interpretation due to the low incidence of disorders of sex development in the general population. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The risk for malignant transformation may occur in early life and highly increase with age in patients with Y chromosome or Y-derived sequences. Optimal timing of gonadectomy should be decided by multiple factors including the subgroup of disorder, age and degree of patient's maturity. In addition, gonadal biopsy is suggested when the disease is diagnosed and any evidence of premalignancy warranties gonadectomy.

Although ICSI represents one of the most important advances in the treatment of the subfertile male, significant concerns exist regarding the potential for transmission of abnormal genes to the offspring because many of the natural barriers to conception have been bypassed. Because these couples were not able to conceive prior to ICSI, the long-term genetic consequences in these offspring are largely undefined at this time. Genetic abnormalities related to male infertility need to be considered in terms of being (1) causative for male infertility and (2) potentially transmissible to the offspring. Reasons for pursuing a genetic evaluation include (1) establishing a diagnosis, (2) establishing a possible genetic origin, (3) clarifying the pattern of inheritance, and (4) providing information on natural history, variation and expression. The three most common known genetic factors related to male infertility are cystic fibrosis gene mutations leading to congenital absence of the vas deferens, Y-chromosome microdeletions leading to spermatogenic impairment, and karyotype abnormalities. When congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens with azoospermia is encountered, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations are commonly the underlying cause. When testicular failure is manifest by azoospermia or severe oligoszoospermia, Y-chromosome microdeletions may be present in approximately 10-15 per cent of otherwise normal appearing men. Karyotyping can uncover potentially transmissible genetic abnormalities in the infertile male including structural chromosomal disorders such as Klinefelter's (classic 47,XXY), mixed gonadal dysgenesis, chromosomal translocations and XYY syndromes. Finally, potential male infertility genes in animal models are reviewed. Without question, advances in clinical and basic research raise scientific and social issues that must be addressed."

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine frequencies of specific targeted adverse events (AEs) and additional AEs of interest in TS patients. Corresponding safety data in non-TS patients or normal populations were compared for selected AEs. METHODS: Patients may be enrolled at rhGH initiation and followed until discontinuation. Investigators submit AE reports describing any event that is potentially rhGH related or is a targeted event. RESULTS: The Genentech Drug Safety department received 442 AE reports for TS NCGS patients as of June 30, 2006, including 117 serious AEs. Seven deaths occurred; five resulted from aortic dissections/ruptures. The incidence of certain events known to be associated with rhGH (targeted events), including intracranial hypertension, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, scoliosis, and pancreatitis, was increased compared with other non-TS patients in NCGS. There were 10 new-onset malignancies that occurred, including six in patients without known risk factors. Type 1 diabetes also appeared to be increased compared with other NCGS groups. CONCLUSIONS: Children with TS who were treated with rhGH exhibit an increased underlying risk for selected AEs associated with rhGH and for type 1 diabetes, which is likely unrelated to rhGH. The aortic dissection/rupture incidence reflects the higher baseline risk for these events in TS, was consistent with current epidemiological data in smaller TS populations, and is likely unrelated to rhGH. It is not known whether the reported malignancies represent an inherently increased risk in TS patients. Twenty years of experience in 5220 patients indicates no new rhGH-related safety signals in the TS population. The NCGS and similar registries, although focused on the years during rhGH treatment, may also be a window into the natural history of TS in childhood."

However, some patients, particularly those with other findings associated with Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), have a more benign course. METHODS: Thirty-seven of 40 PHS patients and 16 of 16 patients with isolated HH had a lesion confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Records for all patients were reviewed for the following information: presence of seizures, age at seizure onset, seizure type, seizure frequency, number of antiepileptic medications (AEDs) at the time of evaluation, past AEDs, MRI characteristics of the HH, presence of endocrine dysfunction, and presence of developmental and behavioral problems. RESULTS: All isolated HH patients had a history of seizures, compared with 13 of 40 PHS patients (all PHS patients with seizures had hamartomas). In isolated HH, seizures started earlier in life, occurred more frequently, and were harder to control than those in patients with PHS. Isolated HH patients were more likely to have behavioral and developmental problems than were PHS patients. The T2 signal of the hamartoma was isointense to gray matter in the majority of PHS patients, but showed a significant increase in all but one patient with isolated HH. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with isolated HH have a distinct clinical phenotype, showing more severe seizures and neurologic dysfunction, HH showing increased T2 signal, and are more likely to have precocious puberty. In contrast, PHS patients usually have well-controlled seizures and other endocrine disturbances than precocious puberty. Patients with HH with or without seizures should be evaluated carefully for other clinical manifestations of PHS, particularly before surgery is considered."

The fourth infant died early in the course of antifungal therapy, when the eye lesions were progressing. Candida sepsis was particularly prevalent in the very low-birth-weight infant with a prolonged hospital course and treated with multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics.

mechanisms of tissue damage",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21348097,"Cytomegaloviruses (CMV) were initially identified by distinct
histopathological findings that were observed in tissue from a variety of infected
mammals, including humans. Perhaps the most well-recognized finding were inclusion
bearing cells in the salivary glands of infected animals (Jesionek and
Kiolemenoglou, 1904; Ribbert, 1904; Goodpasture and Talbot, 1921; Cole and Kuttner, 1926). Similar histopathologic findings
of intracellular inclusions were noted in tissues from infants dying as a result of
severe congenital (present at birth) cytomegalovirus infection leading to the
designation of this clinical syndrome as cytomegalic inclusion disease (Farber and
Wolbach, 1932). Studies by several
groups of investigators provided compelling evidence from natural history studies
that HCMV was a relatively frequent cause of disease in infants infected in utero
and, that this viral infection could result in neurologic impairment in infected
infants (Hanshaw, 1971; Stagno
et al., 1977; Pass et al., 1980; Williamson et al., 1982; Bale,
1984; Fowler et al., 1992). Importantly, these early studies demonstrated that even infants with
subclinical or silent infections could develop neurological sequelae (Stagno
et al., 1982, 1983; Williamson
et al., 1992). In the late 1960s, HCMV was recognized as a significant cause of
disease in allograft recipients and in the case of hematopoietic allograft
recipients, HCMV infection became recognized as one of the most frequent causes of
death in the post-transplant period (Rifkind, 1965; Myers et al., 1975; Ho, 1977; Rubin et
al., 1979; Winston et al., 1979; Rubin et al., 1981; Rubin and Colvin, 1986; Rubin, 1990). Significant morbidity and
mortality rates were reported in allograft recipients infected with HCMV until
efficacious antiviral chemotherapy was developed for this agent (Emanuel et al., 1988; Schmidt et al., 1991; Goodrich et
al., 1993; Winston
et al., 1993). Similarly, HCMV rapidly emerged as a major opportunistic pathogen
in patients with HIV infection, particularly those in the late stages of the
retroviral infection (Klatt and Shibata, 1988; Gallant et al., 1992; Bowen et
al., 1995; Selik et al., 1996; Spector et al., 1999). The spectrum of diseases
associated with infection with HCMV has been well described in immunocompromised
patients with acute infectious syndromes in which virus replication can be
correlated with end-organ disease. Because immunocompromised patients often present
with multi-organ dysfunction secondary to chronic underlying disease and in some
cases the pharmacologic agents utilized to treat allograft rejection, it has been
difficult to completely define the spectrum of clinical disease associated with HCMV
infection. In contrast to findings in allograft recipients, the disease
manifestations of congenitally (present at birth) infected infants can be related
directly to HCMV infection. Yet even in this group of patients the contribution of
organogenesis particularly that of the developing central nervous system, to the
pathogenesis of disease in HCMV infected infants is not completely understood. As a
result, it is sometimes difficult to directly translate the clinical features of
congenital HCMV infections and end-organ disease to clinical syndromes observed in
other patient populations such as allograft recipients. Lastly, it should be
stressed that, in nearly all cases, symptomatic disease following acute HCMV
infection is limited to patients with deficits in their immune system and clinical
evidence of acute HCMV infection is rarely seen in normal hosts."

It has a frequency varying from 100% to 1% and a generally favorable prognosis with the exception of FSGS, SHU and diabetic glomerulosclerosis. The most frequent glomerular diseases to occur de novo in the kidney graft are membranous glomerulopathy, antiglomerular basement membrane disease in patients with Alport's syndrome, and nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type with antinephrin antibodies in patients with NPHS1 gene mutations. Chronic rejection, including chronic transplant arteriopathy and chronic transplant glomerulopathy, is the cause of renal failure in up to 20% of kidney grafts and may occur as early as a few months after transplant."

The age of presentation ranged from 18 years to 76. Males and females were equally affected. The most common presenting symptoms were anorexia and uremia. Fifty percent of the patients were oliguric at presentation and required dialysis within 24 h, while the mean serum creatinine (Cr) at presentation was 5.1 +/- 6.8 mg/dL. Sixty-two percent of the patients demonstrated evidence of pulmonary involvement. Hematuria was universally present and was macroscopic in 35% of cases. Eight-two percent of the biopsies demonstrated greater than 80% crescents. Eight patients retained independent renal function after immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and plasmapheresis. No patient who presented with a Cr greater than 5 mg/dL retained renal function. Using a logistic regression model the only clinical, biochemical, or pathological factors at presentation that significantly predicted eventual need for dialysis were the serum creatinine and percentage of glomeruli with crescents. Ten patients underwent cadaveric renal transplantation, and 7 have a functioning graft for a mean of 8.2 years. None have shown evidence of recurrence of anti-GBM disease in the graft. We conclude that anti-GBM disease is an important cause of renal failure and that its prognosis is directly related to the degree of renal failure at presentation. Efforts need to be made to diagnose this condition earlier in its natural history if its prognosis is to be improved."

The progression of mesangiocapillary GN can probably be slowed or even reversed with long-term, alternate-day steroid therapy.

In rapidly progressive (extracapillary) GN with crescents, ""traditional"" therapy with oral steroids, immunosuppressive drugs and anticoagulants reduces renal mortality from 85%-90% to about 50%, while pulsed methylprednisolone and plasma exchange improve the outcome further, mortality falling to about 25%.

The aim of this study was to describe the natural history and pathophysiology of these abnormal calcifications in HGPS, and to determine whether medications and/or supplements tested in clinical trials alter their development. METHODS:Children from two successive clinical trials administering 1) lonafarnib (n = 26) and 2) lonafarnib + pravastatin + zoledronic acid (n = 37) were studied at baseline (pre-therapy), one year on therapy, and at end-of-therapy (3.3-4.3 years after the baseline visit). Calcium supplementation (oral calcium carbonate) was administered during the first year of the second trial and was subsequently discontinued. Information on calcifications was obtained from physical examinations, radiographs, and serum and urinary biochemical measures. The mineral content of two skin-derived calcifications was determined by x-ray diffraction. RESULTS:Extraskeletal calcifications were detected radiographically in 12/39 (31%) patients at baseline. The odds of exhibiting calcifications increased with age (p = 0.045). The odds were unaffected by receipt of lonafarnib, pravastatin, and zoledronate therapies. However, administration of calcium carbonate supplementation, in conjunction with all three therapeutic agents, significantly increased the odds of developing calcifications (p = 0.009), with the odds plateauing after the supplement's discontinuation. Composition analysis of calcinosis cutis showed hydroxyapatite similar to bone. Although serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were within normal limits at baseline and on-therapy, PTH increased significantly after lonafarnib initiation (p < 0.001). Both the urinary calcium/creatinine ratio and tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) were elevated at baseline in 22/39 (56%) and 31/37 (84%) evaluable patients, respectively, with no significant changes while on-therapy. The mean calcium × phosphorus product (Ca × Pi) was within normal limits, but plasma magnesium decreased over both clinical trials. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) was lower compared to age-matched controls (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS:Extraskeletal calcifications increased with age in children with HGPS and were composed of hydroxyapatite. The urinary calcium/creatinine ratio and TRP were elevated for age while FGF23 was decreased. Magnesium decreased and PTH increased after lonafarnib therapy which may alter the ability to mobilize calcium. These findings demonstrate that children with HGPS with normal renal function and an unremarkable Ca × Pi develop extraskeletal calcifications by an unidentified mechanism that may involve decreased plasma magnesium and FGF23. Calcium carbonate accelerated their development and is, therefore, not recommended for routine supplementation in these children."

Results:This study included 27 patients (median age, 5.6 years; age range, 2-17 years; 15 [56%] male). Among echocardiographic indicators, LV diastolic dysfunction, defined as a tissue Doppler septal or lateral early velocity z score less than -2, was the most prevalent abnormality, seen in 16 patients (59%). Diastolic dysfunction was seen in all age groups, and its prevalence increased with age, mirroring findings seen during normal aging. Indicators of LV diastolic function were more abnormal in older patients. The z scores for lateral and septal early velocities were lower (r = -0.77, P < .001; and r = -0.66, P < .001, respectively), whereas those for the ratio of early mitral inflow velocity to early diastolic tissue Doppler myocardial velocity were higher (r = 0.80, P < .001; and r = 0.72, P < .001, respectively) in older patients. Other echocardiographic findings, including LV hypertrophy, LV systolic dysfunction, and valve disease, were less prevalent in the first decade and were seen more frequently in the second decade.

Here, we have reviewed accomplishments of the NHS over the past 30 years and sought to describe relevant trends among NHS subjects over this time, with emphasis on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) use and non-AIDS comorbidities. METHODS:Subjects who were prospectively enrolled in the NHS from 1986 through 2015 were included in this analysis. Time periods were classified by decade of study conduct, 1986-1995, 1996-2005, and 2006-2015, which also correlate approximately with pre-, early-, and late-combination ART (cART) eras. Analyses included descriptive statistics and comparisons among decades. We also evaluated mean community log10 HIV viral load (CVL) and CD4 counts for each year. RESULTS:A total of 5,758 subjects were enrolled between 1986 and 2015, of whom 92% were male with a median age of 28 years, and 45% were African-American, 42% Caucasian, and 13% Hispanic/other. The proportion of African-Americans remained stable over the decades (45%, 47%, and 42%, respectively), while the proportion of Hispanic/other increased (10%, 13%, and 24%, respectively). The CD4 count at HIV diagnosis has remained high (median 496 cells/uL), while the occurrence of AIDS-defining conditions (excluding low CD4 count) has decreased by decade (36.7%, 5.4%, and 2.9%, respectively). Following the introduction of effective cART in 1996, CVL declined through 2000 as use increased and then plateaued until guidelines changed. After 2004, cART use again increased and CVL declined further until 2012-15 when the vast majority of subjects achieved viral suppression. Non-AIDS comorbidities have remained common, with approximately half of subjects experiencing one or more new diagnoses overall and nearly half of subjects diagnosed between 2006 and 2015, in spite of their relatively young age, shorter median follow-up, and wide use of cART. CONCLUSIONS:The US Military HIV NHS has been critical to understanding the impact of HIV infection among active-duty service members and military beneficiaries, as well as producing insights that are broadly relevant. In addition, the rich repository of NHS data and specimens serves as a resource to investigators in the DoD, NIH, and academic community, markedly increasing scientific yield and identifying novel associations. Looking forward, the NHS remains relevant to understanding host factor correlates of virologic and immunologic control, biologic pathways of HIV pathogenesis, causes and consequences of residual inflammation in spite of effective cART, identifying predictors of and potential approaches to mitigation of excess non-AIDS comorbidities, and helping to understand the latent reservoir."

SUMMARY ANSWER:LCTs are more frequent than generally believed, are associated with male infertility, cryptorchidism and gynecomastia, and should be treated conservatively (in compliant patients) with active surveillance, which appears to be a safe alternative to surgical enucleation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY:Increasing referrals for testicular imaging have led to an increase in findings of LCTs. The features and natural history of these tumors remain largely unknown, as the available studies are small and heterogeneous.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS:Of the 9949 inpatients and outpatients referred for scrotal ultrasound, a total of 83 men with LCTs were included. Enrolled subjects underwent medical history and clinical examination and were asked to undergo routine blood tests, hormone investigations (FSH, LH, total testosterone, estradiol, inhibin B, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), prolactin), and semen analysis. Patients who consented also underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound, elastography, gadolinium-enhanced scrotal magnetic resonance imaging, and hCG stimulation test (5000 IU i.m.) with serum total testosterone and estradiol measured at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE:In total, 83 patients diagnosed with LCTs were compared against 90 patients diagnosed with seminoma and 2683 patients without testicular lesions (NoL). LCTs were diagnosed by enucleation (48.2%), orchiectomy (13.3%), or clinical surveillance (38.5%). Testicular volume, sperm concentration, and morphology were lower (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively) in patients with LCTs than in the NoL group. FSH, LH, and SHBG were higher and the testosterone/LH ratio was lower in LCTs than in the NoL group (P < 0.001). The LCT group showed higher SHBG (P = 0.018), lower sperm concentration (P = 0.029), and lower motility (P = 0.049) than the seminoma group. Risk factors for LCTs were cryptorchidism (χ2 = 28.27, P < 0.001), gynecomastia (χ2 = 54.22, P < 0.001), and low testicular volume (χ2 = 11.13, P = 0.001). Five cases were recurrences or bilateral lesions; none developed metastases during follow-up (median, 66 months). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION:This study has some limitations. First, hCG and second-line diagnostic investigations were not available for all tumor patients. Second, ours is a referral center for infertility, thus a selection bias may have altered the baseline features of the LCT population. However, given that the comparison cohorts were also from the same center and had been managed with a similar protocol, we do not expect a significant effect. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS:LCTs are strongly associated with male infertility, cryptorchidism, and gynecomastia, supporting the hypothesis that testicular dysgenesis syndrome plays a role in their development. Patients with LCTs are at a greater risk of endocrine and spermatogenesis abnormalities even when the tumor is resected, and thus require long-term follow-up and prompt efforts to preserve fertility after diagnosis.LCTs have a good oncological prognosis when recognized early, as tissue-sparing enucleation is curative and should replace orchiectomy. Conservative surgery and, in compliant patients, active surveillance through clinical and radiological follow-up are safe options, but require monitoring of testicular failure and recurrence.

Current evidence about determining factors is conflicting, suggesting patient neglect, on the one hand, and biologically aggressive behaviour, on the other, with outcomes varying from clearance to death. We aimed to clarify the natural history of GBCC and its response to treatment. METHODS:We extracted information from clinical records of all patients with GBCC treated from 1998 to 2017 in a tertiary oncology hospital in northwest England. Associations between patient and tumour characteristics were investigated, and modes of treatment and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS:In the 20-year study period, 43 patients (median age 76 years; 23 (53%) female), 3 of whom had Gorlin syndrome, were treated for GBCCs. Median diameter was 6.3 cm, and median time to presentation was 5 years. Seven (16%) GBCCs arose from recurrent BCC, while the majority (84%) presented de novo. The size of GBCC was significantly correlated with delay in presentation (p = 0.03) but not with age or sex. Of 41 patients receiving definitive treatment, 19 GBCCs were treated by excision with ≤1 cm margin and none recurred during follow-up, compared with 10 recurrences of 23 treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT), and 1 of 7 recurred after radiotherapy. Two of 43 patients with GBCC (<5%) presented with extensive local invasion, one of whom also had distant metastases, and both died of the disease. CONCLUSION:The majority of GBCCs are not clinically aggressive and respond to conservative surgical treatment with a low risk of recurrence."

The overall incidence of these conditions is difficult to estimate but autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO) has an incidence of 1 in 250,000 births, and autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO) has an incidence of 1 in 20,000 births. Osteopetrotic conditions vary greatly in their presentation and severity, ranging from neonatal onset with life-threatening complications such as bone marrow failure (e.g. classic or ""malignant"" ARO), to the incidental finding of osteopetrosis on radiographs (e.g. osteopoikilosis). Classic ARO is characterised by fractures, short stature, compressive neuropathies, hypocalcaemia with attendant tetanic seizures, and life-threatening pancytopaenia. The presence of primary neurodegeneration, mental retardation, skin and immune system involvement, or renal tubular acidosis may point to rarer osteopetrosis variants, whereas onset of primarily skeletal manifestations such as fractures and osteomyelitis in late childhood or adolescence is typical of ADO. Osteopetrosis is caused by failure of osteoclast development or function and mutations in at least 10 genes have been identified as causative in humans, accounting for 70% of all cases. These conditions can be inherited as autosomal recessive, dominant or X-linked traits with the most severe forms being autosomal recessive. Diagnosis is largely based on clinical and radiographic evaluation, confirmed by gene testing where applicable, and paves the way to understanding natural history, specific treatment where available, counselling regarding recurrence risks, and prenatal diagnosis in severe forms. Treatment of osteopetrotic conditions is largely symptomatic, although haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is employed for the most severe forms associated with bone marrow failure and currently offers the best chance of longer-term survival in this group. The severe infantile forms of osteopetrosis are associated with diminished life expectancy, with most untreated children dying in the first decade as a complication of bone marrow suppression. Life expectancy in the adult onset forms is normal. It is anticipated that further understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these conditions will reveal new targets for pharmacotherapy."

Costello syndrome is typically characterized by failure to thrive in infancy as a result of severe postnatal feeding difficulties; short stature; developmental delay or intellectual disability; coarse facial features (full lips, large mouth, full nasal tip); curly or sparse, fine hair; loose, soft skin with deep palmar and plantar creases; papillomata of the face and perianal region; diffuse hypotonia and joint laxity with ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers; tight Achilles tendons; and cardiac involvement including: cardiac hypertrophy (usually typical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), congenital heart defect (usually valvar pulmonic stenosis), and arrhythmia (usually supraventricular tachycardia, especially chaotic atrial rhythm/multifocal atrial tachycardia or ectopic atrial tachycardia). Relative or absolute macrocephaly is typical, and postnatal cerebellar overgrowth can result in the development of a Chiari I malformation with associated anomalies including hydrocephalus or syringomyelia. Individuals with Costello syndrome have an approximately 15% lifetime risk for malignant tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma in young children and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in adolescents and young adults. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of Costello syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous HRAS pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Failure to thrive is the most common and challenging clinical problem; most infants require nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding; many require Nissen fundoplication. Treatment of cardiac manifestations and malignancy is routine. Ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers often requires early bracing and occupational and/or physical therapy; tight Achilles tendons may require surgical tendon lengthening. Developmental disability requires early-intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Recurrent facial papillomata may require routine removal with dry ice. Hemodynamically significant valvar stenoses require antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis; anesthesia may pose a risk to those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or those predisposed to some types of atrial tachycardia. Surveillance: Monitoring for neonatal hypoglycemia; echocardiography with electrocardiogram at diagnosis with subsequent follow up by a cardiologist who is aware of the spectrum of cardiac disease and its natural history; abdominal and pelvic ultrasound examinations to screen for rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma every three to six months until age eight to ten years may be considered; annual urinalysis for evidence of hematuria to screen for bladder cancer beginning at age ten years. GENETIC COUNSELING:Costello syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands with Costello syndrome have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; although parents of probands are not affected, vertical transmission has been reported in two families with the rare, attenuated phenotype. Because Costello syndrome is typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of a proband is presumed to be small; however, recurrence in sibs has been reported and is suspected to be the result of germline mosaicism in a parent. Individuals with Costello syndrome typically do not reproduce. Once an HRAS pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible."

We gathered information on 103 cytogenetically or molecularly confirmed affected individuals. TRPS I was present in 85 individuals (22 missense mutations, 62 other mutations), TRPS II in 14, and in 5 it remained uncertain whether TRPS1 was partially or completely deleted. Main features defining the facial phenotype include fine and sparse hair, thick and broad eyebrows, especially the medial portion, a broad nasal ridge and tip, underdeveloped nasal alae, and a broad columella. The facial manifestations in patients with TRPS I and TRPS II do not show a significant difference. In the limbs the main findings are short hands and feet, hypermobility, and a tendency for isolated metacarpals and metatarsals to be shortened. Nails of fingers and toes are typically thin and dystrophic. The radiological hallmark are the cone-shaped epiphyses and in TRPS II multiple exostoses. Osteopenia is common in both, as is reduced linear growth, both prenatally and postnatally. Variability for all findings, also within a single family, can be marked. Morbidity mostly concerns joint problems, manifesting in increased or decreased mobility, pain and in a minority an increased fracture rate. The hips can be markedly affected at a (very) young age. Intellectual disability is uncommon in TRPS I and, if present, usually mild. In TRPS II intellectual disability is present in most but not all, and again typically mild to moderate in severity. Missense mutations are located exclusively in exon 6 and 7 of TRPS1. Other mutations are located anywhere in exons 4-7. Whole gene deletions are common but have variable breakpoints. Most of the phenotype in patients with TRPS II is explained by the deletion of TRPS1 and EXT1, but haploinsufficiency of RAD21 is also likely to contribute. Genotype-phenotype studies showed that mutations located in exon 6 may have somewhat more pronounced facial characteristics and more marked shortening of hands and feet compared to mutations located elsewhere in TRPS1, but numbers are too small to allow firm conclusions."

The clinical manifestations of FRDA include ataxia of the limbs and trunk, dysarthria, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac diseases. However, the broad clinical spectrum makes FRDA difficult to identify. The diagnosis of FRDA is based on the presence of suspicious clinical factors, the use of the Harding criteria and, more recently, the use of genetic testing for identifying the expansion of a triplet nucleotide sequence. FRDA is linked to a defect in the mitochondrial protein frataxin; an epigenetic alteration interferes with the folding of this protein, causing a relative deficiency of frataxin in affected patients. Frataxins are small essential proteins whose deficiency causes a range of metabolic disturbances, including oxidative stress, iron-sulfur cluster deficits, and defects in heme synthesis, sulfur amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, stress responses, and mitochondrial function. The cardiac involvement seen in FRDA is a consequence of mitochondrial proliferation as well as the loss of contractile proteins and the subsequent development of myocardial fibrosis. The walls of the left ventricle become thickened, and different phenotypic manifestations are seen, including concentric or asymmetric hypertrophy and (less commonly) dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia are associated with mortality in patients with FRDA, whereas hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not. Systolic function tends to be low-normal in FRDA patients, with an acute decline at the end of life. However, the literature includes only a few long-term prospective studies of cardiac progression in FRDA, and the cause of death is often attributed to heart failure and arrhythmia postmortem. Cardiomyopathy tends to be correlated with the clinical neurologic age of onset and the nucleotide triplet repeat length (i.e., markers of phenotypic disease severity) rather than the duration of disease or the severity of neurologic symptoms. As most patients are wheelchair-bound within 15 years of diagnosis, the clinical determination of cardiac involvement is often complicated by comorbidities. Researchers are currently testing targeted therapies for FRDA, and a centralized database, patient registry, and natural history study have been launched to support these clinical trials. The present review discusses the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and spectrum of cardiac disease in FRDA patients and then introduces gene-targeted and pathology-specific therapies as well as screening guidelines that should be used to monitor cardiac disease in this mitochondrial disorder."

These symptoms-tinnitus, ataxia, and hearing loss--secondary to eighth nerve dysfunction, as well as symptoms arising from damage to adjacent structures such as the facial nerve, trigeminal nerve, or pons, can be caused by tumor growth or treatment. Determination of optimal therapy must also take into account an understanding of the natural history of the disease, because acoustic schwannomas are slow-growing benign tumors that when left untreated, usually enlarge over time and cause problems."

Clinical sites were selected over a wide geographic range within Latin America and the Caribbean, taking into account the dynamic course of the ZIKV epidemic. METHODS:Recruitment to the PW cohort will take place in antenatal care clinics. PW will be enrolled regardless of symptoms and followed over the course of pregnancy, approximately every 4 weeks. PW will be revisited at delivery (or after miscarriage/abortion) to assess birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities according to the evolving definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). After birth, children will be followed for 2 years in the CH cohort. Follow-up visits are scheduled at ages 1-3, 4-6, 12, and 24 months to assess neurocognitive and developmental milestones. In addition, a NH cohort for the characterization of symptomatic rash/fever illness was designed, including follow-up to capture persisting health problems. Blood, urine, and other biological materials will be collected, and tested for ZIKV and other relevant arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever) using RT-PCR or serological methods. A virtual, decentralized biobank will be created. Reciprocal clinical monitoring has been established between partner sites. Substudies of ZIKV seroprevalence, transmission clustering, disabilities and health economics, viral kinetics, the potential role of antibody enhancement, and co-infections will be linked to the cohort studies. DISCUSSION:Results of these large cohort studies will provide better risk estimates for birth defects and other developmental abnormalities associated with ZIKV infection including possible co-factors for the variability of risk estimates between other countries and regions. Additional outcomes include incidence and transmission estimates of ZIKV during and after pregnancy, characterization of short and long-term clinical course following infection and viral kinetics of ZIKV.

Methods:Eight subjects with disease-causing variants in PDE6C were assessed in detail, including clinical phenotype, best-corrected visual acuity, fundus autofluorescence, and optical coherence tomography. Six subjects also had confocal and nonconfocal adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy, axial length, international standard pattern and full-field electroretinography (ERG), short-wavelength flash (S-cone) ERGs, and color vision testing. Results:All subjects presented with early-onset nystagmus, decreased best-corrected visual acuity, light sensitivity, and severe color vision loss, and five of them had high myopia. We identified three novel disease-causing variants and provide phenotype data associated with nine variants for the first time. No subjects had foveal hypoplasia or residual ellipsoid zone (EZ) at the foveal center; one had an absent EZ, three had a hyporeflective zone, and four had outer retinal atrophy. The mean width of the central EZ lesion on optical coherence tomography at baseline was 1923 μm. The mean annual increase in EZ lesion size was 48.3 μm. Fundus autofluorescence revealed a central hypoautofluorescence with a surrounding ring of increased signal (n = 5). The mean hypoautofluorescent area at baseline was 3.33 mm2 and increased in size by a mean of 0.13 mm2/year. Nonconfocal adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy revealed residual foveal cones in only one of two cases. Full-field ERGs were consistent with severe generalized cone system dysfunction but with relative preservation of S-cone sensitivity. Conclusions:PDE6C retinopathy is a severe cone dysfunction syndrome often presenting as typical achromatopsia but without foveal hypoplasia. Myopia and slowly progressive maculopathy are common features. There are few (if any) residual foveal cones for intervention in older adults."

Metabolic abnormalities are not known to be part of the syndrome. We present one of the oldest cases reported in the literature, who developed severe metabolic abnormalities and hepatic disease suggesting that these features may be part of the syndrome. Case presentation:A 27-year-old woman, diagnosed with ROHHAD syndrome at age 15, who previously developed diabetes insipidus, growth hormone deficiency, hyperprolactinemia, and hypothyroidism in her first decade of life. This was followed by insulin resistance, NAFLD, liver fibrosis, and splenomegaly before age 14 years. Her regimen included a short course of growth hormone, and cyclic estrogen and progesterone. Her metabolic deterioration continued despite treatment with metformin. Interestingly, she had a favorable response to liraglutide therapy despite having a centrally mediated cause for her obesity. At age 26, a 1.6 cm lesion was found incidentally in her liver. Liver biopsy showed hepatocellular carcinoma which was successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation. Conclusion:Metabolic abnormalities, Insulin resistance and fatty liver disease are potentially part of the ROHHAD syndrome that may develop over time. GLP1 agonists were reasonably effective to treat insulin resistance and hyperphagia. Patients with ROHHAD may benefit from close follow up in regards to liver disease."

Women are often in great danger, where they should be safest. Violence against women is the most pervasive yet the least recognized human rights violation in the world. It is a profound health problem and femicide, is often the tragic end-point of violence. Females represent more than half of the Egyptian population, however, they remain vulnerable. AIM OF THE STUDY:To describe and analyze data obtained from Zeinhom Morgue records in Cairo, regarding female deaths, throughout two years. To evaluate female deaths regarding age, cause, manner of death, location, perpetrator and motive. To describe the incidence of female homicides and their related injury patterns. To identify the risk factors and nature of violence from victimologic point of view. Finally, to describe the manner of death whether natural, homicidal, suicidal or accidental aiming for early identification of vulnerable females so that actions can be taken to prevent further mortality. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:This is a national two year retrospective descriptive mortuary based study. The study population comprised of all adult females, aged 18 years and older, whose death was suspicious and medico-legal examination was ordered. Each investigation included a detailed case history, investigation, gross examination, histo-pathological and toxicological examinations. Data was collected from autopsy reports, hospital records and police records. From the available data the victim profile was made. RESULTS:All female deaths aged 18 years and older were retrospectively reviewed for 2 years at Zeinhom morgue of Medico-legal Authority from a total of 1858 autopsy cases. The most common manner of death was homicide. The commonest cause of death in homicides was due to sharp traumatic injuries. Natural death was the least common manner of death and ischemic heart disease constituted the commonest cause. Falling from height was the most common method of suicidal related deaths. Regarding poisoned cases, insecticides and carbon monoxide were the most common detected poisons. According to the cause of death (trauma), blunt trauma injuries were the most common. Falling from height constituted the largest percent of cases under this group. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS:Females in the third decade of life with blunt injuries to the head and neck were the majority of adult female autopsies. Homicide was the most common manner of female death using sharp instruments after domestic arguments mainly by a spouse or relative. Accidental death came second mainly due to post-operative complications. In cases of suicide, falling from height was the commonest cause followed by poisoning. These findings could be useful for forensic pathologists and healthcare promoters in predicting and preventing female deaths. Moreover, this emphasizes the need for raising public awareness about the scale of female violence problem in our society. The results of this study indicates that, by not only a strong legal support network, but also by opportunities for economic independency, essential education and awareness, alternative accommodation and a change in attitude and mindset of society, judiciary, legislature, executive, men and most importantly women themselves can lower or even prevent such deaths specially suicidal."

AIM:To investigate the immune status of natural killer (NK) and T cells in different phases of chronic hepatitis B. METHODS:The frequency, phenotype and function of circulating NK cells, as well as nonantigen-specific and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific T cell responses were detected by flow cytometry in healthy and HBV-infected subjects. RESULTS:The ability of NK cells to produce IFN-γ was markedly attenuated in HBV-infected patients overall but was less compromised in IC patients. Patients in the IT and IA phases also displayed significantly lower TNF-α production compared to healthy subjects. NK cells were phenotypically activated in the IA and ENEG phases, as evidenced by the upregulation of NKp44 in CD56bright NK cells and CD69 in CD56dim NK cells. Furthermore, global T-cells from the ENEG phase displayed a proinflammatory cytokine profile with upregulated IFN-γ and TNF-α expression, while this profile was suppressed in IT and IA patients. Finally, core and S antigen-specific T cell responses were significantly stronger after in vitro expansion in the IC phase compared to other phases. CONCLUSION:Our findings demonstrate the changes in immune response pattern during the natural history of HBV infection. Both NK and T cells are functionally impaired in the IT and IA phases. With the spontaneous clearance of HBeAg and hepatitis B surface antigen decline, NK cell cytokine production and HBV-specific T responses are partially restored in IC phase, and the ENEG phase is dominated by nonantigen-specific T cell responses."

Benign histotypes, such as hemangiopericytomas, are now considered a cellular phenotypic variant of this heterogeneous group of rare spindle-cell tumors. Owing to their rarity and resemblance to other, more common brain tumors, ISFTs are often poorly recognized and remain a diagnostic challenge. METHODS:We describe a surgical series of 29 patients treated for ISFTs confirmed histologically and through immunohistochemistry. We attempt to provide a focus on the natural history of these pathologies and the need for tailored management. RESULTS:This was a retrospective consecutive series of 29 patients with either solitary fibrous tumor (n = 14) or hemangiopericytoma (n = 15) over a 10-year period. Mean follow-up time was 37.71 months. Recurrence rate was 42.9% for solitary fibrous tumors versus 26.7% for hemangiopericytomas.

CONCLUSIONS:Histopathology and immunohistochemical staining (characterized by positive expression of mainly STAT6 but also CD34, Bcl-2 protein, and vimentin) are key in diagnosis and management of ISFTs. Although ISFTs are still considered benign lesions with very rare aggressive evolution, their clinical behavior is largely unpredictable.

Subsequent histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma. Angiographic evidence here is atypical of the natural history of hemangiopericytomas with dual vascular supply and was critical in the decision-making towards surgical resection without tumor embolization.

We have conducted a systematic review of clinical case series of CNS hemangiopericytoma analyzing the biology of the tumor and the best follow-up and management strategy.Fifteen pertinent clinical case series on newly diagnosed CNS hemangiopericytoma were selected by a review of literature. A total of 523 patients were analyzed for age, sex, mode of recurrence and metastases, and survival after complete/incomplete resection with or without radiation.The mean age was found to be 44.17 (±3.59) years. The incidence was higher in male individuals younger than 45 years and in older female individuals. Complete resection and adjuvant radiation significantly improved survival in comparison with incomplete resection and no radiation, respectively (P<0.0001).

The mean time for distant metastases was seen to be 91.33 (±12.66) months.Complete resection followed by adjuvant radiation improves survival. Extraneural metastases, especially to lung, bone, and liver, are not uncommon and can occur late in the disease course for which continued follow-up is required.

We set out to refine the understanding of the clinical spectrum and natural history of these phenotypes, and now describe 35 patients with segmental overgrowth and somatic PIK3CA mutations. The phenotypic data show that these previously described disease entities have considerable overlap, and represent a spectrum. While this spectrum overlaps with Proteus syndrome (sporadic, mosaic, and progressive) it can be distinguished by the absence of cerebriform connective tissue nevi and a distinct natural history. Vascular malformations were found in 15/35 (43%) and epidermal nevi in 4/35 (11%) patients, lower than in Proteus syndrome. Unlike Proteus syndrome, 31/35 (89%) patients with PIK3CA mutations had congenital overgrowth, and in 35/35 patients this was asymmetric and disproportionate. Overgrowth was mild with little postnatal progression in most, while in others it was severe and progressive requiring multiple surgeries. Novel findings include: adipose dysregulation present in all patients, unilateral overgrowth that is predominantly left-sided, overgrowth that affects the lower extremities more than the upper extremities and progresses in a distal to proximal pattern, and in the most severely affected patients is associated with marked paucity of adipose tissue in unaffected areas. While the current data are consistent with some genotype-phenotype correlation, this cannot yet be confirmed."

RESULTS:During more than 842 patient-years of observation in 242 patients with sickle hemoglobin C disease, 15 episodes of bacteremia occurred in nine patients. Septicemia was fatal in one patient. The overall incidence of bacteremia, 1.8 events per 100 patient-years (95% confidence limits: 0.8, 2.8) in patients with sickle hemoglobin C disease, was similar to that in hematologically normal children.

CONCLUSIONS:The incidence of bacteremia is not increased in young patients with sickle hemoglobin C disease and sickle beta(+)-thalassemia. Further, unlike its course in children with sickle cell anemia, it rarely evolves into life-threatening septicemia. This probably results from the maintenance of relatively intact splenic function during infancy and early childhood in patients with sickle hemoglobin C disease and sickle beta(+)-thalassemia.

The fetal hemoglobin concentration of SS infants declined more slowly than that of infants with sickle cell hemoglobin C disease (SC infants). Pocked RBC counts rose sharply after 6 months of age, and by 1 year, 28% of SS infants had abnormal counts, above 3.5%, indicating poor splenic function. At 3 years of age, 78% of SS patients and 32% of SC patients had abnormal pocked RBC counts. The SS patients with concurrent alpha-thalassemia had, after 6 months of age and throughout early childhood, a slightly higher mean total hemoglobin concentration and lower mean pocked RBC and reticulocyte counts than SS patients without alpha-thalassemia.

It results in a heterogeneous group of disorders whose phenotype range from asymptomatic to severe. Hb E trait and Hb EE are mild disorders. The combination of Hb E and Hb S (Hb SE) results in a sickle cell disease syndrome similar to sickle beta(+) thalassemia. It is important to distinguish Hb E disorders diagnostically because of this marked difference in clinical course among different genotypes. Screening tests, including hemoglobin electrophoresis and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), may suggest other mutations, unless one is familiar with the findings. E beta-thalassemia, the most serious form of E syndromes, affects a million people worldwide and is increasing in North America. Its phenotype ranges from mild anemia to severe transfusion-dependent thalassemia major. Several genetic modifiers affect the phenotype, including the type of beta-thalassemia mutation, Hb F levels, and co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia. However, the cause of the phenotypic variability is largely unknown. A prospective natural history study of E beta-thalassemia in Sri Lanka suggests that environmental modifiers are prognostically important. The clinical course of E beta-thalassemia is punctuated by acute and chronic complications that may cause serious morbidity and mortality. Recent studies indicate these patients are at high risk for thromboembolism secondary to a hypercoagulable state increased by splenectomy. Morbidity from iron overload in nontransfused patients secondary to increased gastrointestinal iron absorption is common. Cardiopulmonary disease, including pulmonary hypertension, requires ongoing monitoring and is secondary to iron overload, thromboembolism, and hemolysis-induced nitric oxide deficiency. These patients are excellent candidates for Hb F-modulating agents because moderate changes in hemoglobin may result in marked improvement in phenotype.

Sri Lanka Thalassaemia Study Group.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10711926,"BACKGROUND:Thalassaemias pose an increasing problem for the Indian subcontinent and many Asian countries. We analysed the different types of thalassaemia in the Sri Lankan population, surveyed gene frequencies in schoolchildren, and estimated the burden of disease and requirements for its control. METHODS:We analysed blood samples from patients attending clinics in nine hospitals and defined the different types of beta thalassaemia by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and DNA analysis. The range of mutations was obtained by analysis of beta-globin genes. Capillary blood was obtained from schoolchildren from different parts of the island and analysed by HPLC to provide an approximate assessment of the carrier frequency of beta thalassaemia and haemoglobin E (HbE). To estimate the frequency of alpha thalassaemia the alpha-globin genotypes were also analysed when it was possible. FINDINGS:Blood samples were obtained from 703 patients with beta thalassaemia and from 1600 schoolchildren. The thalassaemia mutations were unevenly spread. Although 23 different beta-thalassaemia mutations were found, three accounted for the thalassaemia phenotype in about 70% of the patients, most whom are homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for IVS1-5 (G-->C) or IVS1-1 (G-->A). The third common mutation, codon 26 (G-->A), which produces HbE, interacts with one or other of these mutations to produce HbE/beta thalassaemia; this comprises 13.0-30.9% of cases in the main centres. Samples from 472 patients were analysed to determine the alpha-globin genotype. Overall, 15.5% patients were carriers for deletion forms of alpha+ thalassaemia. Average gene frequencies showed that there will be more than 2000 patients requiring treatment at any one time, in the future, of whom those with HbE/beta thalassaemia will account for about 40%. INTERPRETATION:In Sri Lanka, interactions of the two common beta-thalassaemia alleles will nearly always result in a transfusion-dependent disorder. However, about 40% of patients will have HbE/beta thalassaemia, which has a variable course. The management of these disorders could require about 5% of the total health budget.

The ability of blood to flow freely in vessels relies on complex homeostasis that exists between blood cells (including platelets), plasma proteins, coagulation factors, inflammatory factors and cytokines, and the endothelial lining within the lumen of arteries and veins. When there is an imbalance with this physiologic process, there can be an increased risk of developing a thrombosis versus a coagulopathy (increased risk of bleeding). In certain clinical circumstances, patients can be at increased risk of thrombosis and bleeding simultaneously (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-DIC, or in patients with underlying malignancy who develop a coagulopathy). As such, the diagnosis and management of thrombosis are complex. They can arise in any organ system, and their clinical presentation can vary depending on underlying comorbidities and presence (or absence) of provoking factors. Many factors can impact management decisions including whether venous or arterial, acute or chronic, first or subsequent episode, family history, risk factor assessment, and hemodynamic stability. The use and duration of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy depend on a careful assessment of these factors. Furthermore, a decision to pursue an exhaustive hypercoagulable workup to further evaluate for inherited or acquired conditions that predispose to thrombosis is controversial and should only be completed in carefully selected patients or with subspecialty hematology evaluation prior. Together, acute venous and arterial thrombosis accounts for the most common causes of death in developed countries.[1] This mortality obviously depends on location and acuity of thrombosis, with myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke accounting for the highest proportion of thrombosis-associated death in the United States.[1] An understanding of the basic pathophysiology of thrombosis and provoking risk factors can aid clinicians in the diagnosis, workup, and management of this condition. However, the topic is incredibly broad with many management-specific differences and decisions depending on etiology, risk factors, the location of thrombus (venous or arterial), and selection of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. Many patients may require subspecialty evaluation with cardiologists, pulmonologists, neurologist, and/or hematologists. The state of the science on arterial and venous thrombosis is continually evolving, as is our understanding of provoking risk factors, hypercoagulability testing, and medical management. There are also many unique presentations that add complexity to the diagnosis and treatment decisions, such as in acquired anti-phospholipid syndrome or with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia & thrombosis (HITT). As such, many of these case- or disease-specific details and management aspects are beyond the scope of this review article. Readers are encouraged to consult additional references for further reading, including regularly updated subspecialty society guidelines (e.g., American Society of Chest Physicians, American Heart Association, & American Society of Hematology). This review will focus primarily on the basic pathophysiology of venous and arterial thrombosis, including assessment of provoking risk factors and further workup that may be advisable following the initial presentation.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the prevailing concept was that HIT was associated only with arterial thrombosis, through its unique pathogenesis via heparin-dependent, platelet-activating IgG antibodies. However, in 1990, when I began to encounter HIT in my clinical practice, I found that most such patients developed symptomatic venous thrombosis. This historical sketch summarizes some of the research that challenged the dogma of HIT being a mainly arterial prothrombotic disorder. Two studies - one a substudy of a randomized trial of post-orthopedic surgery thromboprophylaxis, and the second a retrospective five-hospital analysis of consecutive patients with positive test results for HIT antibodies - showed a marked predominance of venous over arterial thrombosis complicating HIT (~ 4 : 1). By the end of the 1990s, an even more dramatic manifestation of HIT-associated venous thrombosis was recognized: venous limb gangrene. Here, ischemic limb necrosis occurs despite palpable arterial pulses, as a result of both macrovascular and microvascular venous thrombosis. The surprising explanation was natural anticoagulant impairment (severe depletion of protein C, a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant) resulting from treatment of HIT-associated deep vein thrombosis with warfarin (vitamin K antagonist). These insights from HIT research helped to elucidate the pathogenesis of ischemic limb losses in other intense non-HIT hypercoagulability states, including warfarin-associated venous limb gangrene complicating cancer-associated hypercoagulability, and symmetrical peripheral gangrene complicating disseminated intravascular coagulation of critical illness, in which proximate 'shock liver' helps to explain the profound failure of natural anticoagulant systems (protein C; antithrombin) in predisposing to peripheral limb microthrombosis in circulatory shock."

Very high AFP values did seem to be correlated with risk for identifiable liver lesions. Determination of the natural changes in AFP levels over time will allow more appropriate comparison."

A thirteen-year review],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15503950,"Tumors diagnosed during the first month of life are infrequent: 0.5 to 2% of all childhood neoplasms. This is an interesting group of tumors because their type, relative incidence, natural history and response to treatment differ from those seen in older children. AIM: To contribute the experience of our institution in congenital tumors the last 13 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The records of all neonates (< 31 days old) diagnosed with solid tumors since January 1990 to December 2002 have been retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven neonates have been diagnosed with tumors in the last 13 years. Thirteen patients (48%) were prenatally diagnosed. Nine babies were diagnosed at the initial neonatal exam (40% of those diagnosedd after birth). Neuroblastoma was the commonest tumor (10 cases, 37%), of which 4 were stage I, 4 stage IV-S and 2 stage III. There were 8 teratomas (3 sacrocoxigeal, 1 retroperitoneal, 1 in the CNS, 1 orbitary and two oronasal), two hepatic tumors (1 hepatoblastoma, 1 hemangioendothelioma, two CNS tumors, two giant nevus (one on a hamartoma), and one each Wilms tumor, infantile fibrosarcoma and myofibroblastic tumor. Treatment was surgical resection alone in 17 cases (68%) and surgery + chemotherapy in 8 (32%) (5 neuroblastomas, one CNS tumor, one Wilms tumor and one presacral teratoma who developed a yolk sac tumor); 3 patients died (11%): one at surgery, one of tumoural airway obstruction at birth and one with craniopharyngioma. Among the 14 tumors that were initially not malignant, two can be locally agressive, one was an immature teratoma, the giant nevus with hamartoma developed in situ melanoma, the other nevus had meningeal melanosis with hydrocephalus, and one mature presacral teratoma developed a yolk sac tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of congenital tumors is performed earlier in recent years due to the wide use of prenatal ultrasound. Their natural history is more benign than in other age groups, except for CNS tumors and very large or obstructing tumors. The histological patern is not determinant of the outcome. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice, most cases not need adjuvant chemotherapy. We ought to pass this message on to our colleagues in prenatal diagnosis, so parents get reliable information."

The aim of this study is to describe the clinical, biochemical, and histopathological findings in a group of Mexican HT1 patients and their outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Medical records of HT1 patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2011 were analyzed. The diagnosis of HT1 was confirmed by detection of succinylacetone in urine or blood. RESULTS:Sixteen nonrelated HT1 cases were analyzed. Mean age at clinical onset was 9 months, and the mean age at diagnosis was 16.3 months. Main clinical findings were hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, cirrhosis, liver failure, tubulopathy, nephromegaly, Fanconi syndrome, seizures and failure to thrive. Histopathological findings were cirrhosis, fibrosis and steatosis. The HT1 group had a mortality rate of 78%. Patients who received supportive care or nutritional treatment had a 3-year survival rate of 10%. For those who underwent liver transplantation, the 6-year survival rate was 60%. In most cases pharmacological treatment with nitisinone and special dietary products were not available. The leading causes of death were fulminant liver failure, metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, and porphyria-like neurologic crisis. Newborn screening programs in combination with the availability of orphan drugs, proper monitoring, genetic counseling, and clinical practice guidelines are needed to enable physicians to identify the disease, delay its progression, and improve patients' quality of life. CONCLUSION:The devastating natural history of HT1 is still observed in Mexican patients because they are not diagnosed and treated during the early stages of the disease."

Despite the dramatic improvements in survival, outcomes and quality of life seen with NTBC treatment, HT-1 remains a chronic disorder with several long-term complications, including, a persistent (albeit low) risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and suboptimal neuropsychological outcomes. There remain unsolved key-questions concerning the long-term outcomes of patients with HT-1, which closely depend on the quality of follow-up in these patients. In the absence of published guidelines, we investigated the follow-up methods used for French and Belgian patients with HT-1. A simple questionnaire providing a rapid overview of follow-up procedures was sent to the 19 physicians in charge of HT-1 patients treated with NTBC and low-tyrosine diet in France and Belgium.

It usually presents with liver failure but can be manifest as chronic liver disease. Rarely, it may present with nonhepatic manifestations such as renal dysfunction, porphyria-like illness or cardiomyopathy. There is a high lifetime risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Prior to the development of liver transplantation, most patients died in childhood.The clinical manifestations stem from the cytotoxicity of tyrosine metabolites accumulating proximal to the metabolic defect. Nitisinone acts on tyrosine metabolism upstream of the defect to prevent the production of these metabolites. Nitisinone is used in combination with a tyrosine- and phenylalanine-restricted diet. Nitisinone has transformed the natural history of tyrosinaemia. Liver failure is controlled in 90% of patients, those with chronic liver disease improve and nonhepatic manifestations are abolished. Nitisinone is well tolerated and has few adverse effects other than a predictable rise in plasma tyrosine levels. Nitisinone provides protection against HCC if it is started in infancy, but if commenced after the age of 2 years, a significant risk of HCC remains. Furthermore, where nitisinone is used pre-emptively, liver disease appears to be prevented, suggesting the importance of neonatal screening for tyrosinaemia where possible. Nitisinone is indicated for all children with HT-1, and liver transplantation is only indicated where nitisinone fails, or where the development of HCC is likely or suspected."

All infected infants are now between 10 months and 2.5 years old. They all are asymptomatic even those who initially presented abnormal biological parameters or slightly abnormal ultrasound scans during fetal life. Presently, screening for CMV antibody cannot be recommended because it induces economic, psychological and ethical problems. Furthermore, there is no efficient and safe treatment available so far. However, we do think that large studies must be performed to increase our knowledge about the natural history of intrauterine CMV infection. This is also important for an improved assessment of the value of ultrasound examination results as well as the biological parameters measured in fetal blood samples."

As an example, the congenital rubella syndrome first described in the 1940s is preventable by use of the vaccine but cases still occur. It is hoped that with the introduction of the measles, mumps, rubella immunization for young children, rubella will become as rare in the UK as it is in the USA. Cytomegalovirus is now a more common cause of handicap than rubella but no vaccine has been developed. Although antiviral drugs are available for herpes simplex virus and vaccinia, infection mortality in the newborn is high, even following the use of these agents; many HSV infections in the newborn arise following primary and asymptomatic maternal infections so that treatment may start late in the course of the illness. The obstetrician needs to understand the natural history as well as possible investigations available for congenital infections. There may be warning signs which require action, such as herpetic lesions in the genital tract of the mother. Less specific abnormalities during pregnancy, such as intra-uterine growth retardation and spontaneous onset of preterm labour, may point to congenital infection. This chapter describes both antenatal and postnatal management of the major congenital infections. We have included recent research data that should influence clinical practice; studies on HSV which suggest that, for women with a history of recurrent infection, routine viral culture of the genital tract at the end of pregnancy is unnecessary; reports from both the USA and the UK that rubella immunization performed inadvertently during early pregnancy has not resulted in the congenital rubella syndrome. The chapter would not have been complete without a discussion of human immunodeficiency virus, of concern to the obstetrician and midwife.

Reimer's migration percentage is the most common index for quantifying hip dysplasia from planar radiographs. However, measurement uncertainty could undermine the diagnostic accuracy. A Monte Carlo simulation was created to investigate the impact of measurement error on decision making in hip surveillance programmes. The simulation was designed to mimic the annual surveillance of children with cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Functional Classification System levels III-V) between 2 and 8 years of age. Simulation parameters for the natural history of hip dysplasia and measurement error were derived from published data. At each measurement interval, the influence of uncertainty in the measurement of Reimer's migration percentage on decision-making was investigated. The probability of a child being indicated for intervention in error during the course of the simulation was relatively high, particularly in the highest functioning cohort where the positive predictive value of Reimer's migration percentage was at best 70% and at worse less than 20%. Including a rate of progression term within the decision-making algorithm had a negative effect on positive predictive power. This simulation suggests that hip surveillance programmes are sensitive to detecting genuine hip dysplasia but can have poor positive predictive power, potentially resulting in unnecessary indication for intervention."

Progressive lateral hip displacement can result in severe pain, impaired function and quality of life. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature to identify the natural history of untreated spastic hip displacement in children with cerebral palsy. METHODS:A search of the literature was carried out using PubMed to identify papers describing the natural history of spastic hip displacement in children with cerebral palsy. Population-based studies, large retrospective cohort series, and randomized trials were included when available; expert opinion and case series were excluded. RESULTS:A total of 79 articles were reviewed. Articles were then subdivided into 4 main categories: epidemiology, pathophysiology, outcome, and prevention. The prevalence of hip displacement as defined as a migration percentage >30% was found to be 33% in pooled population-based studies. The risk of hip displacement was found to be linked to a child's gross motor function. Hip surveillance programs have been shown to be sustainable and capable of preventing hip dislocation. The majority of children with hip dislocation do develop pain, decreased function, and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL). CONCLUSIONS:Children with cerebral palsy are at risk of progressive lateral hip displacement proportional to their gross motor function. Untreated progressive lateral hip displacement has been shown to negatively impact a child's HRQOL and hip surveillance can decrease the incidence of hip dislocation."

Femoroacetabular impingement, specifically cam-type femoroacetabular impingement, hip dysplasia, and the sequelae of pediatric hip disease can predispose the hip to early OA. However, many patients with abnormal anatomic findings do not develop early OA, suggesting that there exist other patient characteristics that are protective despite abnormal bony anatomy. Outcome studies show that arthroscopic and open hip procedures improve pain and function in patients with symptomatic hips. However, there is currently limited evidence that these procedures extend the life of the patient's natural hip. Additional studies are needed to determine protective or adaptive factors in patients with abnormal anatomy who do not develop early OA and to determine whether joint preserving hip surgery extends the life of the native hip joint."

This article will contrast neuromuscular hip dysplasia with developmental dysplasia of the hip. It will be shown how the development and utilization of the Gross Motor Function Classification System has contributed to our understanding of the epidemiology and natural history of hip dysplasia in children with CP, and to the assessment of outcomes following surgical management.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:The MEN 2 syndromes are characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma and other endocrinopathies. In addition, some patients with MEN 2A develop Hirschsprung's disease (HD), and all patients with MEN 2B have intestinal neuromas and megacolon that can cause significant gastrointestinal problems. METHODS:From 83 families with MEN 2A, eight patients with HD were identified (MEN 2A-HD). These and all patients with MEN 2B followed at the authors' institution (n = 53) were sent questionnaires to describe the onset and type of gastrointestinal symptoms and treatment they had before the diagnosis of MEN 2. Records of all patients responding were reviewed, including radiographic imaging, histology, surgical records, and genetic testing. RESULTS:Thirty-six of the 61 patients (59%) responded (MEN 2A = 8, MEN 2B = 28) to the questionnaires. All patients with MEN 2A-HD were operated on for HD 2 to 63 years before being diagnosed with MEN 2. All patients responding were underweight as infants and had symptoms of abdominal pain, distention, and constipation. Eighty-eight percent had hematochezia, 63% had emesis, and 33% had intermittent diarrhea before surgery. All patients with MEN 2A-HD had rectal biopsies with a diverting colostomy as the initial surgical procedure. This was followed by a colostomy takedown and pull-through procedure at a later interval. Ninety-three percent of patients with MEN 2B had gastrointestinal symptoms 1 to 24 years before the diagnosis of MEN 2. Symptoms included flatulence (86%), abdominal distention or being underweight as a child (64%), abdominal pain (54%), constipation or diarrhea (43%), difficulty swallowing (39%), and vomiting (14%). Seventy-one percent of patients with MEN-2B with gastrointestinal symptoms had radiographic imaging, 32% were admitted to the hospital, and 29% underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS:Patients with MEN 2A-HD had a typical HD presentation and always required surgery. Patients with MEN 2B have significant gastrointestinal symptoms, but less than a third had surgical intervention. Understanding the clinical course and differences in these patients will improve clinical management."

In addition, familial phaeochromocytoma alone has also been reported and we and others have identified germline VHL mutations in five of six kindreds analysed previously. Germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, and in the VHL tumour suppressor gene cause MEN 2 and VHL disease, respectively. To further investigate the genetics of phaeochromocytoma predisposition, we analysed three groups of patients with no evidence of VHL disease, MEN 2 or NF1: Group A, eight kindreds with familial phaeochromocytoma; Group B, two patients with isolated bilateral phaeochromocytoma; and Group C, six cases of multiple extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma or adrenal phaeochromocytoma with a family history of neuroectodermal tumours. Germline missense VHL mutations were identified in three of eight kindreds with familial phaeochromocytoma. A germline VHL mutation was also characterised in one of the two patients with bilateral phaeochromocytoma. No VHL or RET mutations were detected in the final group of patients with multiple extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma or adrenal phaeochromocytoma with a family history of neuroectodermal tumours. The absence of germline VHL and RET gene mutations in many of these families suggested that other phaeochromoeytoma susceptibility loci may exist. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been recently identified as a natural ligand for RET. Thus, it seems plausible that GDNF is a good candidate gene to play a role in phaeochromocytoma susceptibility. We searched for germline mutations in GDNF in 16 cases of familial phaeochromocytoma (groups A, B and C) and looked for evidence of somatic change in GDNF in 28 sporadic phaeochromocytomas, 12 MEN 2 phaeochromocytomas and five VHL phaeochromocytomas. No GDNF mutations were identified in patients with familial phaeochromocytoma disease, but a c277C-->T (R93W) sequence variant was identified in one of 28 sporadic tumours. This candidate mutation was identified in the germline and tumour tissue but was not present in 104 control GDNF alleles. GDNF sequence variants including R93W have been suggested previously to represent low penetrance susceptibility mutations for Hirschsprung disease and the R93W was not identified in 376 control alleles studied by others. These findings suggest that although GDNF mutations do not appear to have a major role in the pathogenesis of familial or sporadic phaeochromocytomas, allelic variation at the GDNF locus may modify phaeochromocytoma susceptibility."

In the latter group of mice, immunocyte responses were significantly low and the distribution of immunocytes markedly different, with the immunoglobulin-producing cells being located only at the deep layer of lamina propria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We report on a 6-year-old male child displaying an association of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), lung hypoplasia, corneal clouding and coarse face in the absence of distal digital/nail hypoplasia. Based on the recently published diagnostic guidelines, our patient fits the narrow definition of FS. Only a minority of FS patients surviving the neonatal period have been reported, thus limiting the recognition of the infantile phenotype. We compared the features observed in our proband with those of 10 published survivors. Neurological impairment ranging from mild to severe was present in all patients, while seizures manifested in one third of them, often in association with central nervous system malformations. Other characteristic features included central-paracentral corneal clouding, coarsening of the facial traits, gastroesophageal reflux, Hirschsprung disease, intestinal malrotation, hydronephrosis and vescico-ureteral reflux. These manifestations are representative of the natural history of this condition and should also be searched for in FS survivors."

Along with advances in fetal therapies and interventions, a comprehensive natural history specific to the etiology of AVB, as well as the electrophysiological factors influencing outcome, are needed to best select treatment options.Twenty-eight fetuses with AVB were evaluated by fetal magnetocardiography; 21 fetuses were evaluated serially.Fetuses with 2 degrees AVB and isolated 3 degrees AVB showed: 1) diverse atrial rhythms and mechanisms of atrioventricular conduction during 2 degrees AVB; 2) junctional ectopic tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia during 3 degrees AVB; 3) reactive ventricular and atrial fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings at ventricular rates >56 beats/min; and 4) flat ventricular FHR tracings at ventricular rates <56 beats/min despite reactive atrial FHR tracings. In contrast, fetuses with 3 degrees AVB associated with structural cardiac disease exhibited predominantly nonreactive heart rate tracings and simpler rhythms.Second-degree AVB, isolated 3 degrees AVB, and 3 degrees AVB associated with structural cardiac disease manifest distinctly different electrophysiological characteristics and outcome. Fetuses with 2 degrees AVB or isolated 3 degrees AVB commonly exhibited complex, changing heart rate and rhythm patterns; all 19 delivered fetuses are alive and healthy. Fetuses with structural cardiac disease and 3 degrees AVB exhibited largely monotonous heart rate and rhythm patterns and poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND:Single-drug as well as standard combination medical therapy for tachyarrhythmias in infants sometimes fails. In those cases, one may consider interventional therapy. However, this option may carry a high risk of morbidity and mortality in infants. The natural history of tachyarrhythmias in infants often favors eventual resolution and reinforces the importance of selecting an effective medical regimen. METHODS:We performed a retrospective analysis of nine infants (median age 2 months) who received combined flecainide and amiodarone therapy for attempted control of refractory tachyarrhythmias. Trough serum drug levels of flecainide were monitored, and 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was used to determine efficacy of therapy. RESULTS:Single-drug treatment with flecainide or amiodarone failed in all of the infants studied. An average of four drugs failed (range one to six) before administration of combined flecainide and amiodarone therapy. During combined therapy, the flecainide dose was 70 to 110 mg/m2 per day, and that for amiodarone was 7.5 to 13.5 mg/kg per day for a mean (+/- SD) of 9 +/- 2 days to load and 5 to 12 mg/kg per day as maintenance. Successful control of tachyarrhythmias was demonstrated in seven (78%) of nine infants (95% confidence interval 46% to 99%) (three of three with congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia, three of three with supraventricular tachycardia and one of three with ventricular tachycardia). During combined therapy, flecainide trough levels ranged from 350 to 731 ng/ml. Corrected QT intervals varied from 0.440 to 0.488 ms. No proarrhythmia occurred. None of the infants required a pacemaker, and all had normal left ventricular dimensions and fractional shortening by echocardiography. Eight of nine infants had a structurally normal heart. One infant had surgical correction of an atrioventricular septal defect. CONCLUSIONS:Combination therapy with flecainide and amiodarone appears to be safe and effective in controlling refractory tachyarrhythmias in infants. The combination of flecainide and amiodarone may obviate the need for early interventional therapy or may allow delay until the child is older."

About 40-50% of adults with congenital heart defects will experience some type of arrhythmia. In the growing population of postoperative patients, the type of rhythm disturbance depends on the type of heart surgery: after operation at ventricular level, conduction disturbances and ventricular arrhythmias are quite common. After surgery at atrial level (e.g. closure of ASD, but much more after atrial correction of transposition), sick sinus syndrome and supraventricular arrhythmias are chiefly observed. Conduction disturbances may be subdivided into the very common intraventricular conduction defects (right bundle branch block, sometimes with left anterior hemiblock) and complete A-V block. Complete heart block has become less frequent in recent years since surgeons have learnt to avoid the bundle of His during VSD closure. All patients with postoperative complete heart block need a permanent pacemaker. Ventricular arrhythmias after ventricular surgery are commonly found if Holter recordings are done, particularly after correction of tetralogy. They are often asymptomatic but may be a cause of late sudden death (1-3% of patients operated on for tetralogy). Antiarrhythmic treatment is indicated if symptoms are present, or in selected asymptomatic patients with a poor hemodynamic result (severe residual pulmonary stenosis or ventricular dysfunction). Sinus node dysfunction and sick sinus syndrome are common after atrial repair of transposition (Mustard or Senning operation). The manifestations are either sinus bradycardia and sinus arrest with long pauses, or atrial reentry tachycardia (Flutter); these may combine, so that antiarrhythmic medication must be associated with permanent pacemaker implantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The patient presented clinically with a lower extremity DFU and peripheral neuropathy with dysesthesia and disturbed sensation of hot and cold. He was treated with an ointment containing C. oestroides extract for five months, without any antimicrobial treatment. Therapy was evaluated by measurement of the transepidermal water loss, skin hydration, photo documentation and planimetry. At each patient's visit, DFU presented a satisfactory healing process. Five months after treatment initiation the patient had complete healing of his DFU. Blood tests after treatment revealed a significant reduction of the levels of the inflammatory markers. Ulcer cultures did not reveal any microbial development neither before nor after treatment. Conclusion:The administration of the C. oestroides extract ointment proved to be effective in this case. Although these results should be further investigated, the reported case suggests a novel option for the management of neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers, especially in patients with severe co-morbidities."

Rapidly evolving therapeutic paradigms have been linked to evidence of progress in PCNSL, a disease long considered to be incurable. Increasing evidence supports the need for efficient diagnosis, staging, and initiation of therapy, ideally at centers with experience with this type of brain cancer. High-dose methotrexate (MTX) remains a cornerstone of induction regimens, and most data support the use of rituximab. However, clinical research challenges must address key questions, including the development of ever more effective and less toxic induction regimens and the selection of the most appropriate and effective consolidation approaches, as well as the fact that, increasingly, PCNSL affects older patients who do not tolerate strong genotoxic irradiation or high-dose chemotherapy (HDC)-based strategies.

We found 11 patients with CTD from five families and 8 patients with HLCSD from five families. The natural history of both disorders varied extensively among patients, ranging from patients who presumably had died from their disease to asymptomatic individuals. All symptomatic patients responded favourably to supplementation with L: -carnitine (in case of CTD) or biotin (in case of HLCSD), but only if treated early. Estimates of carrier frequency of about 1:20 for both disorders indicate that some enzyme-deficient individuals remain undiagnosed. Prospective and retrospective tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses of carnitines from neonatally obtained filter-paper dried blood-spot samples (DBSS) uncovered 8 of 10 individuals with CTD when using both C(0) and C(2) as markers (current algorithm) and 10 of 10 when using only C(0) as marker. MS/MS analysis uncovered 5 of 6 patient with HLCSD. This is the first study to report successful neonatal MS/MS analysis for the diagnosis of HLCSD.

It is harmless, can image almost all organs and systems, can be repeated as often as required, is portable, requires no patient preparation, is relatively inexpensive and guides diagnosis, treatment and follow-up without radiation exposure and harm to the patient. US is the only imaging technique which can be used in field settings to assess CE prevalence because it can be run even on solar power or a small generator in remote field locations.

Of these, E. granulosus sensu stricto has the widest geographical distribution and is the most important agent of human cystic echinococcosis. Previous molecular studies showed that E. granulosus s.s. isolates from the Middle East and western Asia exhibit higher intraspecific diversity than those from other parts of the world, which led to hypotheses on the origin of the species in that region. However, various high-endemicity regions have not been sufficiently covered by such studies, including northern Africa as a well-known focus of this parasite. Here, we report data on the mitochondrial cox1 gene (1609bp) sequence diversity of E. granulosus s.s. from Algerian livestock. An abattoir survey of 1278 animals from the Algerian steppe region (Djelfa) resulted in CE prevalence of 13.9% in cattle (n = 266), 5.7% in sheep (n = 975), and 0% in goats (n = 37). All of 125 molecularly examined cyst isolates belonged to E. granulosus s.s. In total, 73 haplotypes were found, only five of which have been previously reported (from the Middle East and Australia). One haplotype sequence (EgAlg01X) was found to contain an insertion of three bases at the end of the gene. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been reported before for Echinococcus spp. Diversity values of our panel of Algerian samples were in the range of those that have been previously reported from the Middle East and far higher than those from elsewhere. This, together with the low number of shared haplotypes, indicates a more complex biogeographical history of this parasite than hitherto assumed."

A McNemar-Bowker χ2 test of 1414 paired before/after observations of 288 cysts from 157 albendazole-treated patients was significant (p<0.0001). 1236 observations (87.4%) maintained the same class, and 149 (10.5%) progressed, consistent with the classification. Regression to CE3B occurred in 29 of 206 CE4 observations (14.1%). Significant asymmetry confirms the WHO classification's applicability to the natural history of CE and albendazole-induced changes. Regressions may reflect the stability of CE3B cysts."

The purpose of this work is to examine an unidentified semi-spherical and perforate hollow mass, found near the pelvis of an adult female, dated 12th-13th century AD, exhumed of the Church of Santo Domingo de Silos (Prádena del Ricón, Madrid, Spain). The mass was examined by SEM and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy. These procedures revealed a heterogeneous inner surface with both smooth and irregular areas. A larger spherical and several smaller crescent-shaped perforations were noticed. X-ray microanalysis revealed the presence of the elements C, K, P, Ca, Al, Si, Fe, and Mg. The co-localisation of Ca and P suggests that they may be combined in a mineral matrix, likely formed in vivo. Other minerals probably came from the soil, although Fe could be related to the presence of blood. The macroscopic and microscopic appearances, chemical composition, and location of the calcified mass point to a possible hydatid cyst from Echinococcus granulosus, common in agricultural populations. This study used a suite of analytical techniques that are useful in the diagnosis of unknown calcified masses and can, therefore, be recommended for use in future analytical work."

METHOD:We identified an infant male who presented with prematurity, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features for whom a family history of clinical Menkes disease was revealed after discussion with the clinical genetics team. RESULTS:Although initial first-tier genetic testing identified Kdv syndrome (17q21.31 syndrome), the family history led the team to consider a second diagnostic possibility, and testing of ATP7A revealed a pathogenic variant (c.601C>T, p.R201X). CONCLUSION:Menkes disease and KdV syndrome may both present with hypotonia and abnormal hair, in addition to seizures and failure to thrive.

Fragile X syndrome, occurring more severely in males, is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability. Fragile X associated tremor and ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder seen more often in older men. Fragile X associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is a chronic disorder characterized by oligo/amenorrhea and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism before age 40 years. There may be significant morbidity due to: (1) depression and anxiety related to the loss of reproductive hormones and infertility; (2) reduced bone mineral density; and (3) increased risk of cardiovascular disease related to estrogen deficiency. Here we report the case of a young woman who never established regular menses and yet experienced a 5-year diagnostic odyssey before establishing a diagnosis of FXPOI despite a known family history of fragile X syndrome and early menopause. Also, despite having clearly documented FXPOI the woman conceived spontaneously and delivered two healthy children. We review the pathophysiology and management of FXPOI. As a rare disease, the diagnosis of FXPOI presents special challenges. Connecting patients and community health providers with investigators who have the requisite knowledge and expertise about the FMR1 gene and FXPOI would facilitate both patient care and research. There is a need for an international natural history study on FXPOI. The effort should be coordinated by a global virtual center, which takes full advantage of mobile device communication systems."

While affected individuals have traditionally been classified as having one of three MPS I syndromes (Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, or Scheie syndrome), no easily measurable biochemical differences have been identified and the clinical findings overlap; thus, affected individuals are best described as having either severe or attenuated MPS I, a distinction that influences therapeutic options. Severe MPS I. Infants appear normal at birth. Typical early manifestations are nonspecific (e.g., umbilical or inguinal hernia, frequent upper respiratory-tract infections before age 1 year). Coarsening of the facial features may not become apparent until after age one year. Gibbus deformity of the lower spine is common and often noted within the first year. Progressive skeletal dysplasia (dysostosis multiplex) involving all bones is universal. By age three years, linear growth decreases. Intellectual disability is progressive and profound. Hearing loss is common. Death, typically caused by cardiorespiratory failure, usually occurs within the first ten years of life. Attenuated MPS I. The severity and rate of disease progression range from serious life-threatening complications leading to death in the second to third decades to a normal life span complicated by significant disability from progressive joint manifestations and cardiorespiratory disease. While some individuals have no neurologic involvement and psychomotor development may be normal in early childhood, learning disabilities can be present. Clinical onset is usually between ages three and ten years. Hearing loss and cardiac valvular disease are common. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of MPS I is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and either identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in IDUA on molecular genetic testing or detection of deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme α-L-iduronidase. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Infant learning programs/special education for developmental delays; hats with visors/sunglasses to reduce glare; cardiac valve replacement as needed; physical therapy, orthopedic surgery as needed (joint replacement, atlanto-occipital stabilization, early median nerve decompression for carpal tunnel syndrome based on nerve conduction studies before clinical manifestations develop); cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting for hydrocephalus; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy for eustachian tube dysfunction and/or upper airway obstruction; tracheostomy for sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure; PE tubes; surgical intervention for cervical myelopathy. Prevention of primary manifestations: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered as standard of care for children with severe MPS I. Outcome from HSCT is significantly influenced by disease burden at the time of diagnosis (and thus, by the age of the patient). HSCT can increase survival, improve growth, reduce facial coarseness and hepatosplenomegaly, improve hearing, and alter the natural history of cardiac and respiratory symptomatology. HSCT has lesser effects on the skeletal and joint manifestations or corneal clouding. HSCT may slow the course of cognitive decline in children with mild, but not significant, cognitive impairment at the time of transplantation. Due to the morbidity and mortality associated with HSCT, it is currently recommended primarily for children with severe MPS I. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase (Aldurazyme®), licensed for treatment of the non-CNS manifestations of MPS I, improves liver size, linear growth, joint mobility, breathing, and sleep apnea in persons with attenuated disease. The timing of the initiation of ERT is likely to influence the outcome. Prevention of secondary complications: Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for those with cardiac involvement; special attention to anesthetic risks. Surveillance: Early and continuous monitoring of head growth in infants and children; routine median nerve conduction velocity testing; and educational assessment of children with attenuated disease prior to primary school entry. Annual assessment by: orthopedic surgeon, neurologist (for evidence of spinal cord compression), ophthalmologist, cardiologist (including echocardiogram), audiologist, and otolaryngologist. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis prior to significant disease manifestations is warranted in relatives at risk in order to begin therapy as early in the course of disease as possible. GENETIC COUNSELING:MPS I is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each child of a couple in which both parents are heterozygous for a IDUA pathogenic variant has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both pathogenic IDUA variants have been identified in the family."

NKH is classically associated with neonatal apnea, lethargy, hypotonia, and seizures, followed by severe psychomotor retardation in those who survive. METHODS:To determine the natural history of NKH, the authors mailed a 44-question survey to 170 households in the International NKH Family Network. RESULTS:Data for 65 patients (36 boys, 29 girls) were collected from 58 families. One-third of the subjects died; 8 girls died during the neonatal period, and 14 patients died thereafter (2 girls, 12 boys). Median age of death for boys was 2.6 years vs <1 month for girls (p = 0.02). Mean birth weight and length, occipitofrontal circumference, and gestation duration were normal. Two-thirds of infants were ventilated during the neonatal period; of these, 40% died. Ninety percent had confirmed seizures, 75% during the first month of life. Interestingly, three NKH patients never developed seizures. An abnormal corpus callosum and/or hydrocephalus were associated with especially poor gross motor and speech development. Of 25 patients living > or =3 years, 10 were able to walk and say/sign words; all were boys. In six families with more than one affected child, disease course and mortality were similar within each family. CONCLUSIONS:This study reveals a striking and unexpected gender difference in mortality and developmental progress. Of the two-thirds of nonketotic hyperglycinemia patients surviving the newborn period, up to 20% (mostly boys) may learn to walk and communicate by saying or signing words."

Our understanding of the natural history of many prenatally diagnosed surgical conditions has grown significantly in recent years. Whether prenatal surgical consultation can influence perinatal course had not been investigated. METHODS:During an 21-month period, 12,865 prenatal ultrasound studies were performed on a total of 4,551 patients, and 221 prenatal surgical consultations were obtained through a newly established fetal treatment program at a tertiary care prenatal diagnostic center. To evaluate the impact of prenatal pediatric surgical consultation on perinatal course, the authors reviewed changes in management including termination of pregnancy, in utero intervention, and altered site, mode, or timing of delivery. RESULTS:Two hundred twenty-one fetuses were referred for consultation; their 234 congenital anomalies included genitourinary (36%), thoracic (16%), intraabdominal (14.5%), abdominal wall (10.6%), neurological (9%), skeletal (6%), and head and neck (2.5%) defects; 2.5% had tumors and 2.5% were twin pregnancies. Pregnancy was terminated in 9.5% of cases, because of patient request, chromosomal abnormality, or dismal prognosis. In 3.6%, the decision to terminate was changed as a result of consultation. Site of delivery was changed as a result of consultation in 37% to facilitate postnatal evaluation and initiate immediate treatment. Mode of delivery was changed in 6.8% to prevent dystocia, hemorrhage into a tumor, as in sacrococcygeal teratoma, or to provide an emergency airway, as in cervical teratoma. The timing of delivery was changed in 4.5% to avoid further damage to fetal organs in cases of obstructive uropathy, gastroschisis, sacrococcygeal teratoma with high-output failure, and hydrocephalus. Five percent (11) underwent treatment in utero for fetal hydrothorax, obstructive uropathy, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, or lymphangioma. The overall perinatal mortality rate was 2.5%. CONCLUSION:Prenatal pediatric surgical consultation may have a significant impact on the perinatal management of the fetus with a surgically correctable congenital anomaly. Providing obstetric colleagues and families with valuable insight into the surgical management of anomalies allows fetal intervention when appropriate, and delivery in an appropriate setting, by the safest mode of delivery, and at the gestational age appropriate to minimize effects of the anomaly."

RESULTS:The patients were born between 1963 and 2011. Diagnosis of PMM2-CDG was made at a mean (SD) age of 6.8 (8.5) years. The presenting signs were mostly neurological (hypotonia, intellectual disability, cerebellar syndrome) and observed in almost all the patients. A total of 38 patients (14 males, 24 females) exhibited, in addition to neurological signs, visceral features including at least one of these: feeding difficulty requiring a nutritional support (n=23), cardiac features (n=20; pericarditis: 14, cardiac malformation: 9, cardiomyopathy: 2), hepato-gastrointestinal features (n=12; chronic diarrhoea: 7, protein-losing enteropathy: 1, ascites: 3, liver failure: 1, portal hypertension: 1), kidney features (n=4; nephrotic syndrome: 2, tubulopathy: 2) and hydrops fetalis (n=1). Twelve patients died at a mean age of 3.8 years (especially from pericarditis and other cardiac issues). Laboratory abnormalities mostly included elevated transaminases and abnormal coagulation parameters. High thyreostimulin levels, hypocholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia and elevated transaminases were associated with the visceral phenotype.

We have initiated an international registry containing information on 69 patients, of which 31 are previously unpublished. In this perspective, we analyze the available clinical information to document the natural history of BHFS. In the future, once we have accrued sufficient cases, we aim to build on this study and provide information to allow counseling of at-risk couples. To date, 39 patients have survived beyond the age of 5 years, 18 of whom are now older than 10 years. Based on the available cases, we find evidence to suggest that intrauterine therapy provides benefits during the perinatal and neonatal period; however, it may not provide additional benefits to long-term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Growth retardation is a major adverse long-term outcome among BHFS patients with ∼40% being severely affected in terms of weight and ∼50% in terms of height. There is also an increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay as we find 20% (11/55) of BHFS survivors suffer from a serious delay of ≥6 months.

Septated cystic hygroma cases were offered chorionic villi sampling for karyotype, and targeted fetal anatomical and cardiac evaluations. Survivors were followed up for fetal and long-term pediatric outcome (median 25 months, range 12-50 months). Cases of septated cystic hygroma were also compared with cases of simple increased nuchal translucency. RESULTS: There were 134 cases of cystic hygroma (2 lost to follow-up) among 38,167 screened patients (1 in 285). Chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed in 67 (51%), including 25 trisomy-21, 19 Turner syndrome, 13 trisomy-18, and 10 others. Major structural fetal malformations (primarily cardiac and skeletal) were diagnosed in 22 of the remaining 65 cases (34%).

Consequently, fetal karyotyping is frequently offered. We describe 18 families in which 18 pairs of siblings were affected by transient nonseptated cystic hygromata in utero. METHODS: Over a seven-year period, 18 families came to our attention, with a recurrent diagnosis of fetal nonseptated cystic hygromata in two subsequent pregnancies. Detailed anatomic surveys by transvaginal ultrasound were performed between 14 to 16 weeks' gestation on the basis of self-referral. Sonographic markers for fetal aneuploidy were specifically looked for. Nonseptated cystic hygroma was diagnosed when unilateral or bilateral cystic dilations in the anterolateral aspect of the fetal neck were present, as described by Bronshtein et al. (1989).

Probability calculations suggest that if our findings were explained by chance alone, a population base of 367,000 pregnancies would have to be scanned in order to find 18 pairs of siblings with nonseptated cystic hygromata. CONCLUSION: The familial occurrence and identical natural history of the cystic lesions in utero suggest the presence of an inheritable developmental syndrome affecting the lymphatic system in utero, but without long-term sequelae."

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients with the diagnosis of lymphangioma or cystic hygroma from 1958 to 2000 was performed. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were identified with 46 cases confined to the cervicofacial region. Surgical excision was performed on 60 of the 74 cases involving all regions of the body and 34 of the 46 patients with head and neck lesions. The location of the malformation is the most important determinate for surgical success. While surgical excision was the main treatment modality, 11 of 12 untreated patients were noted to improve, with 8 patients showing complete resolution. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of lymphangiomas, the physician should be experienced in the management of such lesions, be aware of spontaneous resolution, and recognize the limitations and potential harm of surgery in certain instances."

METHODS:We report a personal series of 25 cases diagnosed between 10 and 23 weeks gestation and a review of the literature comprising a total of 999 cases. We focused on the etiologies and the value of various prognostic factors in the management of cystic hygromas. These include karyotype, alpha-fetoprotein levels, sonographic findings in the fetus and within the hygroma itself, and natural history. RESULTS:According to the literature, fetal chromosomal abnormalities were associated with cystic hygromas in 62% of the cases. Turner's syndrome remains the most common (33%) but Down's syndrome, Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 13 are not rare (15, 7 and 2%). Others have Mendelian abnormalities. The prognosis remains gloomy. The literature reports that only 9% of cases result in healthy children with normal karyotypes. The remaining 91% are either terminated (89%) or liveborn (2%), but with chromosome abnormalities or various malformations. CONCLUSION:The prognostic factors associated with a poor outcome are an abnormal karyotype and associated structural malformations. Resolution of the hygroma by 20 weeks gestation suggests a good prognosis, but is not definitive. All other factors evaluated do not appear to be of prognostic value at this time. Careful analysis of these prognostic factors is very important to identify the small percentage of normal children and to advise parents effectively for a future pregnancy."

Hymenolepis nana is the most prevalent human tapeworm, especially affecting children. The genomes of Hymenolepis microstoma and H. nana have been recently sequenced and assembled. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, are principle regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and are involved in many different biological processes. In previous work, we experimentally identified miRNA genes in the cestodes Echinococcus, Taenia and Mesocestoides. However, current knowledge about miRNAs in Hymenolepis is limited. In this work we described for the first known time the expression profile of the miRNA complement in H. microstoma, and discovered miRNAs in H. nana. We found a reduced complement of 37 evolutionarily conserved miRNAs, putatively reflecting their low morphological complexity and parasitic lifestyle. We found high expression of a few miRNAs in the larval stage of H. microstoma that are conserved in other cestodes, suggesting that these miRNAs may have important roles in development, survival and for host-parasite interplay. We performed a comparative analysis of the identified miRNAs across the Cestoda and showed that most of the miRNAs in Hymenolepis are located in intergenic regions, implying that they are independently transcribed. We found a Hymenolepis-specific cluster composed of three members of the mir-36 family. Also, we found that one of the neighboring genes of mir-10 was a Hox gene as in most bilaterial species. This study provides a valuable resource for further experimental research in cestode biology that might lead to improved detection and control of these neglected parasites. The comprehensive identification and expression analysis of Hymenolepis miRNAs can help to identify novel biomarkers for diagnosis and/or novel therapeutic targets for the control of hymenolepiasis."

Rapid development of industry and agriculture, as well as climate change throughout the globe, has led to change or increase in occurrence of rodent-borne diseases. Considering the distribution of rodents throughout Iran, the aim of this review is to assess the risk of rodent-borne diseases in Iran. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING:We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Scientific Information Database (SID), and Magiran databases up to September 2016 to obtain articles reporting occurrence of rodent-borne diseases in Iran and extract information from them. Out of 70 known rodent-borne diseases, 34 were reported in Iran: 17 (50%) parasitic diseases, 13 (38%) bacterial diseases, and 4 (12%) viral diseases. Twenty-one out of 34 diseases were reported from both humans and rodents. Among the diseases reported in the rodents of Iran, plague, leishmaniasis, and hymenolepiasis were the most frequent. The most infected rodents were Rattus norvegicus (16 diseases), Mus musculus (14 diseases), Rattus rattus (13 diseases), Meriones persicus (7 diseases), Apodemus spp. (5 diseases), Tatera indica (4 diseases), Meriones libycus (3 diseases), Rhombomys opimus (3 diseases), Cricetulus migratorius (3 diseases), and Nesokia indica (2 diseases). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:The results of this review indicate the importance of rodent-borne diseases in Iran. Considering notable diversity of rodents and their extensive distribution throughout the country, it is crucial to pay more attention to their role in spreading infectious diseases for better control of the diseases."

Among many hypotheses, newly established host populations may benefit from a parasite loss (""enemy release"" hypothesis) through impoverishment of their original parasite communities or reduced infection levels. Moreover, the fitness of competing native hosts may be negatively affected by the acquisition of exotic taxa from invaders (""parasite spillover"") and/or by an increased transmission risk of native parasites due to their amplification by invaders (""parasite spillback""). We focused on gastrointestinal helminth communities to determine whether these predictions could explain the ongoing invasion success of the commensal house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), as well as the associated decrease in native Mastomys spp., in Senegal. For both invasive species, our results were consistent with the predictions of the enemy release hypothesis. A decrease in overall gastrointestinal helminth prevalence and infracommunity species richness was observed along the invasion gradients as well as lower specific prevalence/abundance (Aspiculuris tetraptera in Mus musculus domesticus, Hymenolepis diminuta in Rattus rattus) on the invasion fronts. Conversely, we did not find strong evidence of GIH spillover or spillback in invasion fronts, where native and invasive rodents co-occurred. Further experimental research is needed to determine whether and how the loss of gastrointestinal helminths and reduced infection levels along invasion routes may result in any advantageous effects on invader fitness and competitive advantage."

MKD is characterized by recurrent febrile attacks that are frequently accompanied by lymphadenopathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgia, myalgia, skin rash, and aphthous ulcers. Patients with MVA also have intrauterine growth retardation, congenital defects (cataracts, shortened limbs, and dysmorphic craniofacial features), neurological disease, and failure to thrive. Mean age at onset of symptoms is within the first year of life. There is a delay by several years between symptom onset and diagnosis, which is in part attributable to the initial misdiagnosis due to the rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations of disease. The frequency of recurrent febrile attacks is highest in childhood and gradually decreases after adolescence. MKD is associated with rare long-term complications such as type AA amyloidosis, joint contractures, abdominal adhesions, renal angiomyolipoma, and severe pneumococcal infections. Frequent febrile attacks significantly impair several aspects of patients' and caregivers' quality of life, with an adverse impact on patients' daily activities, education, and employment.

This study was undertaken to determine the characteristics, presentation, natural history, and response to treatment in 46 patients who had been referred for evaluation at the UK National Amyloidosis Centre. METHODS: Disease activity was monitored by serial measurement of serum amyloid A. Renal function was assessed by measurement of serum creatinine and albumin levels, the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria from 24-hour urine collections. The amyloid load was measured by serum amyloid P scintigraphy. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had familial Mediterranean fever, 12 patients had tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, 6 patients had cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, and 4 patients had mevalonate kinase deficiency. The median age at onset of HPFS was 5 years; median age at presentation with AA amyloidosis was 38 years. Diagnosis of an HPFS had not been considered prior to presentation with AA amyloidosis in 23 patients (50%). Eleven patients (24%) had end-stage renal failure (ESRF) at presentation; of these, 3 had received transplants prior to referral. A further 13 patients developed ESRF over the followup period, with 10 undergoing renal transplantation. The median time to progression to ESRF from onset of AA amyloidosis was 3.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2-8), with a median time to transplant of 4 years (IQR 3-6). Eleven patients (24%) died. The median survival in the entire cohort was 19 years from diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. Of the 37 patients who were treated successfully, or in whom at least partial suppression of the underlying HPFS was achieved, 17 (46%) showed amyloid regression, 14 (38%) showed a stable amyloid load, and 2 (5%) showed increased amyloid deposition over the followup period. CONCLUSION: AA amyloidosis remains a challenging and serious late complication of HPFS; however, outcomes are excellent when HPFS is diagnosed early enough to allow effective treatment, thus preventing or retarding further amyloid deposition and organ damage."

Advances in management have resulted in increases in life expectancy and led to increasing awareness of sickle cell hepatopathy (SCH). However, its impact in patients on the natural history and outcomes of SCD is not known. Our study aims to describe the prevalence of extreme hyperbilirubinemia (EH), one form of SCH, its effect on morbidity and mortality, and correlations between sickle cell genotype and SCH type. We hypothesize that EH is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. AIM:To investigate the effects of EH on morbidity and mortality among patients with SCD. METHODS:This retrospective cohort study was performed using a database of patients with SCD treated at Grady Memorial Hospital between May 2004 and January 2017. Patients with EH (defined as total bilirubin above 13.0 mg/dL) were identified. A control group was identified from the same database with patients with total serum bilirubin ≤ 5.0 mg/dL. Electronic medical records were used to extract demographic information, laboratory values, radiology results, current medications, need for transfusions and mortality data. Two samples T-test, chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were then used to compare the parameters between the two groups. RESULTS:Out of the database, fifty-seven charts were found of patients with bilirubin > 13 mg/dL. Prevalence of severe SCH as defined by EH was 4.8% (57/1172). There were no demographic differences between patients with and without EH. Significant genotypic differences existed between the two groups, with hemoglobin SS SCD being much higher in the EH group (P < 0.001). Patients with severe EH had a significant elevations in alanine aminotransferase (157.0 ± 266.2 IU/L vs 19.8 ± 21.3 IU/L, P < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (256.5 ± 485.9 U/L vs 28.2 ± 14.7 U/L, P < 0.001) and alkaline phosphatase (218.0 ± 176.2 IU/L vs 85.9 ± 68.4 IU/L, P < 0.001). Patients with EH had significantly higher degree of end organ failure measured with quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (0.42 ± 0.68 vs 0.01 ± 0.12, P < 0.001), increased need for blood products (63% vs 5%, P < 0.001), and exchange transfusions (10.5% vs 1.3%, P = 0.022).

Despite this, little is known about the mechanisms of GC resistance in patients with HES. OBJECTIVE:To explore the aetiology of GC resistance in HES. METHODS:Clinical data and samples from 26 patients with HES enrolled on a prospective study of GC responsiveness and 23 patients with HES enrolled on a natural history study of eosinophilia for whom response to GC was known were analysed retrospectively. Expression of GC receptor isoforms was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR in purified eosinophils. Serum cytokine levels were quantified by suspension array assay in multiplex. RESULTS:Despite an impaired eosinophil response to GC after 7 days of treatment, the expected rise in absolute neutrophil count was seen in 7/7 GC-resistant patients, suggesting that GC resistance in HES is not a global phenomenon. Eosinophil mRNA expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) isoforms (α, β, and P) was similar between GC-sensitive (n = 20) and GC-resistant (n = 9) patients with HES. Whereas geometric mean serum levels were also comparable between GC-r (n = 11) and GC-s (n = 19) for all cytokines tested, serum IL-5 levels were >100 pg/mL only in GC-r patients. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:These data suggest that the mechanism of GC resistance in HES is not due to a global phenomenon affecting all lineages, but may be due, at least in some patients, to impairment of eosinophil apoptosis by increased levels of IL-5."

Myeloid mutation panels have identified somatic variants in patients with a provisional diagnosis of hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance, reclassifying some of these cases as eosinophilia-associated neoplasms. Looking forward, one of the many challenges will be how to use the results of molecular profiling to guide prognosis and selection of actionable therapeutic targets."

However, we do not have a good understanding of the drivers or causes of intraspecific variation in dispersal, how strong an effect these drivers have, and how widespread they are across dispersal modes. As a first step to developing a better understanding, we present a broad, but not exhaustive, review of what is known about the drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal, and what remains uncertain. We start by decomposing 'drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal' into intrinsic drivers (i.e. variation in traits of individual plants) and extrinsic drivers (i.e. variation in ecological context). For intrinsic traits, we further decompose intraspecific variation into variation among individuals and variation of trait values within individuals. We then review our understanding of the major intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal, with an emphasis on variation among individuals. Crop size is the best-supported and best-understood intrinsic driver of variation across dispersal modes; overall, more seeds are dispersed as more seeds are produced, even in cases where per seed dispersal rates decline. Fruit/seed size is the second most widely studied intrinsic driver, and is also relevant to a broad range of seed dispersal modes. Remaining intrinsic drivers are poorly understood, and range from effects that are probably widespread, such as plant height, to drivers that are most likely sporadic, such as fruit or seed colour polymorphism. Primary extrinsic drivers of variation in seed dispersal include local environmental conditions and habitat structure. Finally, we present a selection of outstanding questions as a starting point to advance our understanding of individual variation in seed dispersal."

While PD is generally sporadic, there are known genetic influences: the two most common, mutations in the LRRK2 or GBA1 gene, are associated with slower and more aggressive progression, respectively. Here, we applied graph theory to metabolic brain imaging to understand the effects of genotype on the organization of previously established PD-specific networks. We found that closely matched PD patient groups with the LRRK2-G2019S mutation (PD-LRRK2) or GBA1 variants (PD-GBA) expressed the same disease networks as sporadic disease (sPD), but PD-LRRK2 and PD-GBA patients exhibited abnormal increases in network connectivity that were not present in sPD. Using a community detection strategy, we found that the location and modular distribution of these connections differed strikingly across genotypes. In PD-LRRK2, connections were gained within the network core, with the formation of distinct functional pathways linking the cerebellum and putamen. In PD-GBA, by contrast, the majority of functional connections were formed outside the core, involving corticocortical pathways at the network periphery. Strategically localized connections within the core in PD-LRRK2 may maintain PD network activity at lower levels than in PD-GBA, resulting in a less aggressive clinical course."

RECENT FINDINGS:Sporadic IBM is the most common acquired muscle disease in patients older than 50 years of age and is becoming more prevalent because of the increasing age of the population, the emerging development of more inclusive diagnostic criteria, and the advent of a diagnostic autoantibody. No effective therapy is known, and the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. Some pathogenic insight can be gleaned from other myopathies with pathologic similarities or hereditary inclusion body myopathies. Although clinically distinct from sporadic IBM, preclinical models of hereditary inclusion body myopathy have offered an opportunity to move some therapies toward clinical development. SUMMARY:Patients with sporadic IBM experience significant morbidity, and the disease is associated with a large unmet medical need. As therapies are developed, improved diagnosis will be essential. Early diagnosis relies on awareness, clinical history, physical examination, laboratory features, and appropriate muscle biopsy processing. Future research is needed to understand the natural history, identify genetic risk factors, and validate biomarkers to track disease progression. These steps are essential as we move toward therapeutic interventions."

Most previous studies refer to the risk of VS growth over a given period of time; however, this is not useful for counselling patients at different stages of their follow-up, as the risk of tumour growth is likely to be less following each subsequent year that a tumour does not grow. Accordingly, we investigated the conditional probability of VS growth at particular time-points, given a patient has not grown thus far. This Bayesian method of risk stratification allows for more tailored and accurate approximations of the risk of growth versus nongrowth of VS. METHODS:Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database in a tertiary referral skull base unit, containing all patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2014 with sporadic unilateral VS and a minimum of 5-year surveillance. RESULTS:A total of 341 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age at diagnosis was 67 years, the sizes of the VS at diagnosis were intracanalicular in 49%, small in 39%, medium in 11%, and large in 1%. Over the entire 5-year surveillance period, a total of 139 tumours were seen to grow (41%) and 202 did not grow (59%). At 1 year, the probability of growth given that the tumour had not grown to date was seen to be 21%, at 2 years 12%, at 3 years 9%, at 4 years 3%, and at 5 years 2%. The conditional probability of growth of extracanalicular VS was significantly higher in the first year when compared with intracanalicular VS (29% versus 13%, p = 0.01), but there was no such difference in years 2, 3, 4 or 5 (p = 0.60, 0.69, 0.36, 0.39, respectively). CONCLUSION:This is the first study in the literature concerned specifically with the conditional probability of VS growth. The data presented here can be used to better inform VS patients of their risk of growth at particular time points in their disease-the longer VS have been observed to be stable, the lower the risk of subsequent growth in a given year. Further, an extracanalicular vestibular schwannoma is more likely to grow in the first year compared with an intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma. Our data also adds support to surveillance protocols with increasingly infrequent MRI scans, as after 4 years of not growing, the risk of growth in year 5 falls to <2%."

Liver pathology is limited to selected patients or unavailable. Therefore, we aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of liver fibrosis in an adult AATD population who were not known to have cirrhosis, while defining risk factors for fibrosis and testing non-invasive markers of disease. METHODS:A total of 94 adults with classic genotype 'PI*ZZ' AATD were recruited from North America and prospectively enrolled in the study. Liver aminotransferases and markers of synthetic function, transient elastography, and liver biopsy were performed. RESULTS:The prevalence of clinically significant liver fibrosis (F ≥ 2) was 35.1%. Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase values were higher in the F ≥ 2 group. Metabolic syndrome was associated with the presence of clinically significant fibrosis (OR 14.2; 95% CI 3.7-55; p <0.001). Additionally, the presence of accumulated abnormal AAT in hepatocytes, portal inflammation, and hepatocellular degeneration were associated with clinically significant fibrosis. The accuracy of transient elastography to detect F ≥ 2 fibrosis was fair, with an AUC of 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.82). CONCLUSIONS:Over one-third of asymptomatic and lung affected adults with 'PI*ZZ' AATD have significant underlying liver fibrosis. Liver biopsies demonstrated variable amounts of accumulated Z AAT. The risk of liver fibrosis increases in the presence of metabolic syndrome, accumulation of AAT in hepatocytes, and portal inflammation on baseline biopsy. The results support the hypothesis that liver disease in this genetic condition may be related to a ""toxic gain of function"" from accumulation of AAT in hepatocytes. LAY SUMMARY:Individuals diagnosed with classic alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (ZZ) are at risk of liver injury and scarring, because of the accumulation of abnormal alpha-1 antitrypsin in the liver. A liver biopsy in ZZ individuals can demonstrate the accumulation of alpha-1 antitrypsin within the liver and identify if any associated liver scarring is present. Indviduals with large amounts of alpha-1 antitrypsin on biopsy may be at risk of liver injury and fibrosis. Additional common medical conditions of diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, and hypertension (known as metabolic syndrome) are associated with a greater degree of liver injury.

This heterogeneity appears to constitute the underlying cause for the focal cell hyperplasia and eventually the formation of thyroid and adrenal nodules, under the influence of growth stimulatory factors. Among the main stimulatory factors are the pituitary tropic hormones, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyrotropin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which regulate the growth and function of their respective target cells, and the insulin/insulin-like growth factor system, that, through its mitogenic effects, can stimulate the proliferation of these cells. The predominance of one or the other of these growth stimulatory factors appears to determine the natural history of thyroid and adrenal nodular disease. Thus, iodine deficiency was, in the past, the main pathogenic factor responsible, through a transient rise in TSH secretion, for the endemic nodular goiter with the characteristic colloid thyroid nodules among the inhabitants in iodine deficient areas. The correction of iodine deficiency was followed by the elimination of endemic colloid goiter and the emergence of thyroid autoimmunity. The recent epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS), or insulin resistance syndrome, has been associated with the re-emergence of nodular thyroid disease. A parallel rise in the incidence of benign, nonfunctional adrenocortical tumors, known as adrenal incidentalomas, has also been reported in association with the manifestations of the MS. It is likely that the compensatory to insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia may be responsible for the rising trend of thyroid and adrenal nodular disease in the current environment."

In this review, we discuss the peculiarity of energy balance and glucose and lipid metabolism in adult type 1 GD patients. Moreover, we evaluate the potential relationship between these metabolic derangements, cardiovascular risk and chronic liver disease. The limited data available show that adult type 1 GD is characterized by a hypermetabolic state, peripheral insulin resistance and hypolipidemia with markedly reduced HDL-cholesterol levels, partially reverted by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Although this unfavorable metabolic profile has not been associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes and premature atherosclerosis, a natural history study has shown that cardio-cerebrovascular events and malignancy are the leading causes of death in treated type 1 GD patients. Hepatomegaly is frequently observed in GD and ERT/SRT are highly effective in reducing liver volume. Nevertheless, patients with GD may be at increased risk of long-term liver complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The role that ERT/SRT and/or lifestyle habits may have on such metabolic features of GD patients, and subsequently on long-term prognosis, deserves further investigations. To gain more insights into the peculiarity of GD metabolism may serve both surveillance and treatment purposes by helping to identify new markers of disease severity and define an updated natural history of GD."

Clinically, despite genetic heterogeneity, different forms of osteogenesis imperfecta share similar features that include connective tissue and systemic manifestations in addition to bone fragility. Thus, the goals of treatment in osteogenesis imperfecta extend beyond decreasing the risk of fracture, to include the maximization of growth and mobility, and the management of extraskeletal complications.

Previous work suggests that increased bone resorption in FD is driven by RANKL and some studies have shown that the anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody, denosumab, reduces bone turnover and bone pain in FD patients. However, the effect of RANKL inhibition on the histopathology of FD and its impact on the natural history of the disease remain to be assessed. In this study, we treated the EF1α-Gs αR201C mice, which develop an FD-like phenotype, with an anti-mouse RANKL monoclonal antibody. We found that the treatment induced marked radiographic and microscopic changes at affected skeletal sites in 2-month-old mice. The involved skeletal segments became sclerotic due to the deposition of new, highly mineralized bone within developing FD lesions and showed a higher mechanical resistance compared to affected segments from untreated transgenic mice. Similar changes were also detected in older mice with a full-blown skeletal phenotype. The administration of anti-mouse RANKL antibody arrested the growth of established lesions and, in young mice, prevented the appearance of new ones. However, after drug withdrawal, the newly formed bone was remodelled into FD tissue and the disease progression resumed in young mice. Taken together, our results show that the anti-RANKL antibody significantly affected the bone pathology and natural history of FD in the mouse.

METHODS:A PubMed search was undertaken to evaluate recent SCFE literature. A convenience sample of articles were selected and summarized. RESULTS:Most slips appear well tolerated long-term with ∼5% resulting in total hip arthroplasty (THA) at 20-year follow-up. Classic data reveals poor outcomes following closed reduction for treatment of SCFE. Improvements in intraoperative fluoroscopy and avoidance of pin penetration have reduced the rates of chondrolysis. Unfortunately, avascular necrosis remains a known risk in patients, occurring in 15% to 50% of patients following acute, unstable slips. This is the most common cause of THA in patients with SCFE. Rate of THA due to degenerative arthritis secondary to SCFE is more difficult to determine and occurs at a later age. Although realignment procedures to address anatomic abnormalities from SCFE have increased in popularity, it is unclear if this prevents degenerative arthritis and subsequently reduces the rate of THA. SCFE patients face an increased risk of disability and death due to their underlying medical comorbidities. Interventions for weight loss, blood pressure management, and lifestyle adjustments should be considered at the time of SCFE diagnosis.

Among the 14 pregnancies, pregnancy was associated with no change in bone pain in 7 subjects (53%), increased bone pain in 4 subjects (31%), and decreased bone pain in 2 subjects (15%). No additional skeletal complications were reported during pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS:Women with fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome report a high prevalence of gynecologic morbidity and reduced fertility. There is no clear association between pregnancy and poor skeletal outcomes in this population."

DESIGN:Retrospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study of the OxalEurope Registry Network. METHODS:Sixty-eight patients with PH1 were included. Infantile PH1 was diagnosed in 12 patients, and non-infantile PH1 was diagnosed in 56 patients (17 with end-stage renal disease). Ophthalmic examination included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) testing and multimodal retinal imaging, including fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). In selected cases, fundus autofluorescence imaging was performed. RESULTS:All eyes (n = 24) of infantile PH1 patients revealed severe retinal alterations and oxalate deposits, including macular crystals and hyperpigmentations (n = 9, 38%), and subretinal fibrosis (n = 15, 63%) with (n = 7, 47%) or without (n = 8; 53%) associated chronic retinal edema. In 9 eyes (38%, all with subretinal fibrosis), BCVA was significantly reduced (<20/50 Snellen equivalent). In contrast, all eyes (n = 112) of patients with non-infantile PH1 had a BCVA in the normal range (median, 20/20). Only 6 patients with non-infantile disease (11%, all with end-stage renal disease) showed mild, likely PH1-related retinal features. These deposits appeared as focal hyperreflective subretinal lesions on OCT imaging and were hyperautofluorescent on autofluorescence images. CONCLUSIONS:Severe ocular alterations occur in infantile cases, whereas mild or no ocular alterations are typical in non-infantile PH1 patients. The natural history of (sub)retinal oxalate deposits, the pathogenesis of subretinal fibrosis, and exact factors influencing the overall severity of ocular disease manifestation remain to be determined."
731,GARD:0002835,Primary hyperoxaluria type 1,20301460,"['Book', 'Review']",Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301460,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is caused by a deficiency of the liver peroxisomal enzyme alanine:glyoxylate-aminotransferase (AGT), which catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. When AGT activity is absent, glyoxylate is converted to oxalate, which forms insoluble calcium oxalate crystals that accumulate in the kidney and other organs. Individuals with PH1 are at risk for recurrent nephrolithiasis (deposition of calcium oxalate in the renal pelvis / urinary tract), nephrocalcinosis (deposition of calcium oxalate in the renal parenchyma), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Age at onset of symptoms ranges from infancy to the sixth decade. Approximately 10% of affected individuals present in infancy or early childhood with nephrocalcinosis, with or without nephrolithiasis, and failure to thrive related to renal failure. The majority of individuals with PH1 present in childhood or early adolescence, usually with symptomatic nephrolithiasis and normal or reduced kidney function. The remainder of affected individuals present in adulthood with recurrent renal stones and a mild-to-moderate reduction in kidney function. The natural history of untreated PH1 is one of progressive decline in renal function as a result of calcium oxalate deposits in kidney tissue and complications of nephrolithiasis (e.g., obstruction and infection) with eventual progression to oxalosis (widespread tissue deposition of calcium oxalate) and death from ESRD and/or complications of oxalosis. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of PH1 is established in a proband with hyperoxaluria or hyperoxalemia by identification biallelic pathogenic variants in AGXT on molecular genetic testing. Failure to identify at least one AGXT pathogenic variant should prompt examination for other types of primary hyperoxaluria and in occasional circumstances may require consideration of liver biopsy to assay the activity of the enzyme alanine:glyoxylate-aminotransferase (AGT). However, given the wide availability of genetic testing, liver biopsy to obtain tissue for enzymatic activity is now rarely employed. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Reduction of calcium oxalate supersaturation in the urine to minimize stone formation; reduction of calcium oxalate supersaturation in the plasma in individuals with ESRD to minimize systemic deposition of calcium oxalate crystals; treatment of kidney stones; reduction of oxalate biosynthesis; dialysis; organ transplantation as either liver transplantation or combined liver/kidney transplantation. Prevention of primary manifestations: To reduce calcium oxalate supersaturation in the urine: maintenance of high fluid intake; inhibition of calcium oxalate crystal formation with potassium or sodium citrate, pyrophosphate-containing solutions. To reduce oxalate biosynthesis: pyridoxine supplements for those who are pyridoxine responsive. Surveillance: At regular intervals, obtain serum creatinine to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal ultrasound examinations or other kidney imaging, urinalysis; and periodic fundoscopic eye examinations. Additionally: In those with reduced GFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2): regular measurement of plasma oxalate and more frequent monitoring of kidney function. In individuals with greatly reduced GFR (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or rapid deterioration in function: frequent assessment of serum creatinine and plasma oxalate. At regular intervals obtain x-ray examination of the long bones, electrocardiogram for conduction abnormalities, echocardiogram for evidence of oxalate cardiomyopathy, hemoglobin, thyroid function testing, and frequent clinical evaluation for additional complications of oxalosis. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dehydration from any cause can lead to irreversible kidney failure and should be strictly avoided. Individuals with PH1 should avoid intake of vitamin C that exceeds the recommended daily allowance, loop diuretics, high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or other medications that can compromise kidney function; and large intake of foods high in oxalate (e.g., chocolate, rhubarb, starfruit). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis of at-risk relatives enables early institution of treatment and preventive measures. GENETIC COUNSELING:PH1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of a proband with PH1 has a 25% risk of being affected, a 50% risk of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% risk of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both pathogenic variants have been identified in a family. Assay of AGT enzymatic activity prenatally is not generally offered because it requires a fetal liver biopsy."

We extensively studied the parathyroid function of these infants to test the hypothesis that the biochemical hyperparathyroidism found in these infants would be transient in nature, since the presumed etiology (maternal and subsequent fetal hypocalcemia) should disappear soon after birth with establishment of enteral feedings. Infant 1 was born to a mother with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism with poor compliance to therapy and documented hypocalcemia in pregnancy. Severe congenital demineralization and intrauterine fractures with clinical and radiologic bowing of the long bones were obvious. Bone mineral content and bone mineral content/bone width ratio, measured by photon absorptiometry, were both markedly below normal. Infant 2 was born to a mother with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism with excellent compliance. The mother was normocalcemic. The infant was clinically and radiologically asymptomatic. The bone mineral content was just at the lower limit of normal, but bone mineral content/bone width ratio was below the normal limits. Biochemical features include elevation of cord serum parathyroid hormone (1-84, radioimmunoassay) in both cases, coexisting with serum calcium, phosphorus concentrations within normal limits. Serum parathyroid hormone fell to within normal ranges by 9 days of age in both infants. With no treatment, bone mineral content at 1 month of age was normal in both infants."

All individuals had spontaneous and progressive normalization of sodium and fluid balance with age. The severity of the clinical manifestations varied from acute salt-wasting crisis in infancy and unexplained short stature in childhood to an asymptomatic state in adults detectable only by biochemical studies. Infants with HA had extremely elevated plasma renin activity (PRA; 70-650 ng angiotensin 1/ml X h), which gradually decreased with age, and PRA was normal in adults. Cortisol followed a similar pattern, but marked elevations of plasma deoxycorticosterone (DOC; 28-553 ng/dl) and 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OHB; 650-6500 ng/dl) relative to aldosterone (3-29 ng/dl) persisted throughout life in all untreated patients. The plasma 18-OHB/aldosterone ratio, normally 6.2 +/- 3.5 (SD), ranged between 160-760. In contrast, patients with PHA had PRA (70-685 ng angiotensin 1/ml X h), DOC (56-1201 ng/dl), 18-OHB (650-6800 ng/dl), and aldosterone (150-2000 ng/dl) levels which all remained very elevated, but had normal 18-OHB/aldosterone ratios (6.9 +/- 5.1). Comparative studies in 14 untreated patients with 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency, who had moderate to severe manifestations of mineralocorticoid excess, revealed DOC levels (38-1384 ng/dl) that were remarkably similar to those of patients with HA and PHA. PRA, DOC, and 18-OHB correlated significantly with each other during all variations in sodium balance (P less than 0.001). Sodium repletion partially suppressed these parameters in both disorders, but complete normalization was achieved only in HA when a mineralocorticoid was given. Although the degree of DOC and 18-OHB suppression was similar in all age groups, the changes in PRA were more marked in children than in adults since these were directly proportional to the initial elevations of PRA. Although angiotensin II and potassium increased plasma DOC and 18-OHB, dexamethasone failed to suppress them, indicating that these steroids originated predominantly from the zona glomerulosa. The spontaneous normalization of sodium balance is not due to quantitative differences in hormone secretion with age since the basic steroid abnormalities remain unchanged from infancy to adulthood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Diarrhea started in infancy in the two brothers and from the age of 13 in the sister. During the second decade of life, central nervous system symptoms became prominent, with fatigue and disturbance in gait and balance. Night blindness developed at a later phase of the disease in the brothers, whereas cavus developed in both legs in the sister. Apolipoprotein B was absent in all patients, and each had more than 50% of acanthocytes present on peripheral smear. The diagnosis of A-beta-lipoproteinemia was established on the basis of small bowel histology and serum lipid estimations. Family studies revealed normal lipid profiles in all healthy members. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) pattern in the two most severely affected patients was identical. The only detectable difference between the severely ill patients and other members of the family, however, was homozygosity for the HLA B18 antigen, whereas the third patient had no alleles for the HLA B18 antigen. Treatment consisted of a low-fat diet and high doses of vitamins A and E. A modified diet substituting medium-chain triglycerides for dietary fat was also given, with significant improvement in the nutritional status of patients but not in symptoms related to advanced disease, such as retinal and cardiac manifestations. We conclude that the course of the disease in untreated patients is characterized by continuous symptoms. Some of the symptoms, however, especially those related to malabsorption, as well as some anthropometric parameters can be improved by the application of a modified diet including medium-chain triglycerides. We suggest the routine measurement of plasma lipids and apoproteins not only in children with failure to thrive, with unexplained malabsorption, or with neurologic symptoms, but also in adults with chronic diarrhea accompanied by neurologic symptoms or clinical and laboratory signs of malabsorption."

The diagnosis is usually based on discrepancies between fibrinogen activity and antigen levels, but could require more specialized techniques for the assessment of fibrinogen function, owing to some limitations in routine assays. Molecular abnormalities, which are frequently heterozygous missense mutations localized in exon 2 of FGA and exon 8 of FGG, lead to defects in one or more phases of fibrinogen to fibrin conversion, fibrin network formation, and other important functions of fibrinogen. The clinical phenotype is highly heterogeneous, from no manifestations to bleeding and/or thrombotic events. Asymptomatic propositi and relatives with the predisposing genotype are at risk of developing adverse outcomes during the natural course of the disease. Correlations between genotype and phenotype have not yet been clearly established, with the exception of some abnormal fibrinogens that severely increase the risk of thrombosis. Functional analysis of polymerization and fibrinolysis, structural studies of the fibrin network and the viscoelastic properties of fibrin clot could help to predict the phenotype of congenital dysfibrinogenemia, but have not yet been evaluated in detail. The management is essentially based on personal and family history; however, even individuals who are still asymptomatic and without a family history should be carefully assessed and monitored.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of antipituitary antibodies (APA) in a group of HH patients with or without Kallmann's syndrome and to characterize their pituitary target. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: The study was performed at the Endocrinology Unit of the Second University of Naples. PATIENTS: Twenty-one HH patients with normal sense of smell (group 1), 10 patients with Kallmann's syndrome (group 2), 13 patients with HH associated with other pituitary hormone deficiencies (group 3), and 50 normal controls were studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: APA were evaluated in patients and in controls by indirect immunofluorescence. Moreover, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hypothalamic-pituitary region was performed in all three groups of patients. RESULTS: APA were detected at high titer in eight out of 21 patients in group 1 (38%) and in five of 13 in group 3 (38.4%), and at low titers in two out of 10 in group 2 (20%) and in three of 50 controls (6%).

Among the five APA-positive patients in group 3, three had normal MRI, one had findings of empty sella, and one had findings of autoimmune hypophysitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that some apparently idiopathic cases of HH, both isolated and associated with other pituitary impairment, can be caused by an early autoimmune process involving the gonadotrophs at pituitary level. Future longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the natural history of this process and the possible effect of early corticosteroid therapy."

For certain genetic abnormalities, information is helpful in developing potential therapeutic treatment targeting mutations. More treatment options are hopeful with the understanding of specific genetic mutations and their pathogenic mechanism. It also suggests the importance of genetic assessment and counseling for family members of an affected patient, in order to provide potential early diagnosis and better clinical management of DCM."

A novel D230N missense mutation in the gene encoding alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1) was identified. Functional assessment was performed by the use of an in vitro reconstituted sarcomere complex to evaluate ATPase regulation and Ca(2+) affinity as correlates of contractility.TPM1 D230N segregated with DCM in 2 large unrelated families. This mutation altered an evolutionarily conserved residue and was absent in >1,000 control chromosomes. In vitro studies demonstrated major inhibitory effects on sarcomere function with reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximum activation, and Ca(2+) affinity compared with wild-type TPM1. Clinical manifestations ranged from decompensated heart failure or sudden death in those presenting early in life to asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in those diagnosed during adulthood. Notably, several affected infants had remarkable improvement.Genetic segregation in 2 unrelated families and functional analyses conclusively establish a pathogenic role for TPM1 mutations in DCM. In vitro results demonstrate contrasting effects of DCM and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations in TPM1, suggesting that specific functional consequences shape cardiac remodeling. Along with previous reports, our data support a distinctive, age-dependent phenotype with sarcomere-associated DCM where presentation early in life is associated with severe, sometimes lethal, disease. These observations have implications for the management of familial DCM."

BACKGROUND:Mutations in LMNA have been found in patients with DCM with familial conduction defects and muscular dystrophy, but the clinical spectrum, prognosis, and clinical relevance of laminopathies in DCM are unknown. BACKGROUND:A cohort of 49 nuclear families, 40 with familial DCM and 9 with sporadic DCM (269 subjects, 105 affected), was screened for mutations in LMNA using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequence analysis. Bivariate analysis of clinical predictors of LMNA mutation carrier status and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were performed. RESULTS:Mutations in LMNA were detected in four families (8%), three with familial (R89L, 959delT, R377H) and one with sporadic DCM (S573L). There was significant phenotypic variability, but the presence of skeletal muscle involvement (p < 0.001), supraventricular arrhythmia (p = 0.003), conduction defects (p = 0.01), and ""mildly"" DCM (p = 0.006) were predictors of LMNA mutations. The LMNA mutation carriers had a significantly poorer cumulative survival compared with non-carrier DCM patients: event-free survival at the age of 45 years was 31% versus 75% in non-carriers. CONCLUSIONS:Mutations in LMNA cause a severe and progressive DCM in a relevant proportion of patients. Mutation screening should be considered in patients with DCM, in particular when clinical predictors of LMNA mutation are present, regardless of family history."

We evaluated 55 consecutive cases of dilated cardiomyopathy in patients <10 y of age seen during a 5-y interval. Echocardiography was the primary diagnostic modality. The 55 cases represented 20% of the offspring of 41 families of Arab descent. In 19 families (46%), parents were first cousins; there was no obvious consanguinity in 22 families (54%). Age at presentation was <30 mo (95%) (range, 1 to 100 mo); males (38%) and females (62%) were affected. Patients died (25 patients, 46%), improved (15 patients, 27%), or recovered (15 patients, 27%). The left ventricular shortening fraction at diagnosis ranged from 5 to 28% and did not differ in those who died, improved, or recovered. Complex segregation analysis of the family data using the mixed model of inheritance showed that a model of recessive inheritance best fits the data. Recessively inherited dilated cardiomyopathy has been infrequently reported, perhaps because it may be difficult to recognize in other patient groups in which consanguineous marriage is uncommon and the number of children per family is small. In the setting of consanguineous marriage, homozygosity mapping should lead to identification of the gene(s) causing dilated cardiomyopathy in the families we studied."

Aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics, long term course and prognostic factors of IDC patients followed up prospectively since the late eighties. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of IDC confirmed by normal coronary angiography, non specific endomyocardial biopsy findings and a left ventricular ejection fraction below 50% were consecutively enrolled in a multicenter registry and followed up at 6-months intervals. RESULTS: From January 1986 till January 1994, 441 IDC patients with a mean age of 43 +/- 13 years (range 8-68) entered the registry. Thirty per cent of patients were women and 8% had familial dilated cardiomyopathy. NYHA class was I-II in 77% and 35% of patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Treatment included digitalis in 235 patients (53%), diuretics in 239 (54%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in 269 (61%), betablockers in 108 (24%). Chronic atrial fibrillation was detected in 10% of patients and left bundle branch block in 24%. Mean cardiothoracic ratio was 0.54 +/- 0.06. Mean left ventricular end diastolic dimension was 38 +/- 6 mm/m2; 48% of patients had minimal or mild left ventricular dilatation. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 30 +/- 10%. At Holter monitoring 67% of cases had complex ventricular arrhythmias, 37% had ventricular tachycardia and 4% had advanced atrioventricular block. Mean exercise stress test duration was 9 +/- 4 minutes. After a mean follow up of 31 +/- 24 months, 337 patients were alive without transplantation and 5 were lost to follow up; 60 patients (14%) had died of cardiac causes, namely heart failure (6%), sudden death (7%) and pulmonary embolism (< 1%) and 30 had been transplanted (7%), while 4 had died of unclear causes. Survival and transplant-free survival were 94% and 90% at 2 years and 82 and 76% at 5 years, respectively. At multivariate analysis pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p = 0.0001, odds ratio, for values > 15 mm Hg, 2.05) and betablocker treatment (p = 0.002, odds ratio 0.26) were independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, multicenter prospective study, prognosis of IDC in the eighties appears to be improved. Early diagnosis, together with improved medical treatment, probably bears a causal relation to these changes."

Post-TBI hypopituitarism (PTHP) is thought to occur in one-third of patients, however the natural history and predictive factors are not fully understood and as such guidelines for surveillance vary. The aim of this study was to assess the variations in current surveillance practices across the Neurosurgery Centres within the United Kingdom.Methods: A questionnaire was developed following discussions with an expert panel and distributed to members of the Society of British Neurosurgeons (SBNS), by email and printed copy, to survey surveillance practices for PTHP. The questionnaire primarily aimed to determine how commonly screening was performed and the clinical parameters used to guide these surveillance practices.Results: There were 45 responders representing Neurosurgery units in regions of England, Scotland and Ireland. The majority of participants (86.7%) considered PTHP to be a problem but only 25% (11/45) routinely screened for PTHP. There was wide variation in the criteria used to determine which patients were screened.Conclusions: Our survey suggests that few Neurosurgeons routinely screen for PTHP and those that do use a wide variation of clinical parameters to guide surveillance practice. A UK-wide prospective cohort study may help identify patients at risk of developing PTHP."

No paper has focused specifically on clinically nonfunctioning pituitary in-cidentalomas (CNFPIs). OBJECTIVE:To describe the charac-teristics and the natural history of patients diagnosed with CNFPIs. METHODS:Retrospective multicenter cohort study evaluating hormonal, imaging, and visual field characteristics at diagnosis and during follow-up of CNFPIs investigated in 2 Pituitary Centers. RESULTS:Three hundred and seventy-one patients were included (50.9% microadenomas, 35.6% males). Men were older and more likely to have a macroadenoma (p < 0.01). Totally, 23.7% of patients presented secondary hormonal deficits (SHDs), related to tumor size (higher in macroadenomas; p < 0.001) and age (higher in older patients; p < 0.001). Hypogonadism was the most frequent SHD (15.6%). Two hundred and ninety-six patients had follow-up data, 29.1% required surgery after first evaluation, and 97 had at least 3 years of follow-up. In total, 15.3% adenomas grew (more macroadenomas), but only in microadenomas patients with longer follow-up showed a higher growth trend. Totally, 5.2% of patients developed new SHDs (micro- vs. macroadenomas p = 1.000), and in 60% of them this was not associated with an increase in tumor size. Thirteen additional patients required surgery during follow-up (1 microadenoma at diagnosis). CONCLUSIONS:Macroadenomas and age are risk factors for SHD in CNFPIs, which occur at diagnosis in a quarter of patients. During follow-up, macroadenomas tend to grow more often, but microadenomas display higher growth trend as follow-up increases. Deterioration of pituitary function is not always related to adenoma growth."

Additional diagnostic criteria include bifid epiglottis, imperforate anus, small nails, hypopituitarism, growth hormone deficiency, and genital hypoplasia. It is typically diagnosed in infancy and early childhood, presenting with seizures and/or precocious puberty due to the hypothalamic hamartoma, and with limb anomalies due to central polydactyly. Our patient had presented with polysyndactyly at birth. However, as this is not uncommon in infants and is usually as part of the sporadic, isolated form of polydactyly, no further work up was done. He then presented at age 16 years with a headache and subjective visual changes, with brain imaging revealing a hypothalamic hamartoma. He did not have a history of seizures or central precocious puberty. Genotyping revealed a pathogenic variant affecting the GLI3 gene. We encourage all clinicians to consider PHS or an associated syndrome with a clinical finding of polydactyly. Further, as the natural history continues to reveal itself, this patient's presentation provides important new data to the broad phenotypic spectrum of PHS."

In the acute setting, it is important to monitor patients for hypoadrenalism as this confers a high risk for morbidity and even mortality. The gonadotrophin, growth hormone and TSH deficiencies are better defined in the chronic phase. Untreated PTHP can lead to delayed recovery, impaired rehabilitation and persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms.

However, debate still exists about the true prevalence of hypopituitarism after head injury. METHODS:We have reviewed the literature describing the frequency of post-traumatic hypopituitarism and discuss the factors which may explain the variable frequency of the reported deficits in clinical studies including research methodology and the natural history of the disease. RESULTS:Pituitary hormone perturbations in the acute phase following injury are frequent but are difficult to attribute to traumatic pituitary damage due to physiological hormonal changes in acute illness, the confounding effect of medications, other co-morbidities and lack of appropriate control subjects. Nevertheless, a small number of studies have emphasised the clinical importance of acute, dynamic disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. There is a much larger evidence base examining the frequency of hypopituitarism in the chronic, recovery phase following head injury. These studies report a very broad prevalence of long-term pituitary hormone dysfunction in survivors of TBI. However, systematic review suggests the prevalence to be between 27 and 31%. CONCLUSION:Survivors of head injury are at risk of pituitary hormone dysfunction and we suggest an approach to the diagnosis of post-traumatic hypopituitarism in routine clinical practice."

For severe aortic stenosis and pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, the goal of intervention is to alter the natural history such that a biventricular circulation may be achieved postnatally. A growing number of patients have achieved a biventricular circulation; however, patient selection and postnatal management strategy are essential for success. HLHS with intact or highly restrictive atrial septum is one of the most lethal forms of congenital heart disease, and the goal of FCI is to improve survival. Although the creation of an atrial communication in utero is technically feasible and may permit greater stability in the immediate postnatal period, significant improvements in survival have not yet been reported.FCI is an evolving form of treatment for congenital heart disease that holds promise for select patients.

Despite increasing numbers of FVs performed worldwide, the natural history of the disease in fetal life remains poorly defined. The primary aim of this study was to describe the natural history of fetal aortic stenosis, and a secondary aim was to test previously published criteria designed to identify cases of emerging HLHS with the potential for a biventricular (BV) outcome after FV.From a European multicenter retrospective study of 214 fetuses with aortic stenosis (2005-2012), 107 fetuses in ongoing pregnancies that did not undergo FV were included in this study and their natural history was reported. We examined longitudinal changes in Z-scores of aortic and mitral valve and left ventricular dimensions and documented direction of flow across the foramen ovale and aortic arch, and mitral valve inflow pattern and any gestational changes. Data were used to identify fetuses satisfying the Boston criteria for emerging HLHS and estimate the proportion of these that would have been ideal FV candidates. We applied the threshold score whereby a score of 1 was assigned to fetuses for each Z-score meeting the following criteria: left ventricular length and width > 0; mitral valve diameter > -2; aortic valve diameter > -3.5; and pressure gradient across either the mitral or aortic valve > 20 mmHg. We compared the predicted circulation with known survival and final postnatal circulation (BV, UV or conversion from BV to UV).Among the 107 ongoing pregnancies there were eight spontaneous fetal deaths and 99 livebirths. Five were lost to follow-up, five had comfort care and four had mild aortic stenosis not requiring intervention. There was intention-to-treat in these 85 newborns but five died prior to surgery, before circulation could be determined, and thus 80 underwent postnatal procedures with 44 BV, 29 UV and seven BV-to-UV circulatory outcomes. Of newborns with intention-to-treat, 69/85 (81%) survived ≥ 30 days. Survival at median 6 years was superior in cases with BV circulation (P = 0.041). Those with a postnatal UV circulation showed a trend towards smaller aortic valve diameters at first scan than did the BV cohort (P = 0.076), but aortic valve growth velocities were similar in both cohorts to term. In contrast, the mitral valve diameter was significantly smaller at first scan in those with postnatal UV outcomes (P = 0.004) and its growth velocity (P = 0.008), in common with the left ventricular inlet length (P = 0.004) and width (P = 0.002), were reduced significantly by term in fetuses with UV compared with BV outcome. Fetal data, recorded before 30 completed gestational weeks, from 70 treated neonates were evaluated to identify emerging HLHS. Forty-four had moderate or severe left ventricular depression and 38 of these had retrograde flow in the aortic arch and two had left-to-right flow at atrial level and reversed a-waves in the pulmonary veins. Thus 40 neonates met the criteria for emerging HLHS and BV circulation was documented in 13 (33%). Of these 40 cases, 12 (30%) had a threshold score of 4 or 5, of which five (42%) had BV circulation without fetal intervention.The natural history in our cohort of fetuses with aortic stenosis and known outcomes shows that a substantial proportion of fetuses meeting the criteria for emerging HLHS, with or without favorable selection criteria for FV, had a sustained BV circulation without fetal intervention. This indicates that further work is needed to refine the selection criteria to offer appropriate therapy to fetuses with aortic stenosis. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The prenatal diagnosis rate was compared with that reported for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). We reviewed fetal echocardiographic findings in patients who were diagnosed prenatally.In only 10 (8.5%) of 117 neonates with critical AS and a BV outcome was the diagnosis made prenatally, a rate significantly lower than that for HLHS in the contemporary era (82%; P < 0.0001). Of the 10 patients diagnosed prenatally, all had developed left ventricular dysfunction by a median gestational age of 33 (range, 28-35) weeks. When present, Doppler abnormalities such as retrograde flow in the aortic arch (n = 2), monophasic mitral inflow (n = 3) and left-to-right flow across the foramen ovale (n = 8) developed late in gestation (median 33 weeks).The prenatal diagnosis rate of critical AS and a BV outcome among neonates is very low, probably owing to a relatively normal four-chamber view in mid-gestation with development of significant obstruction in the third trimester. The natural history contrasts with that of severe mid-gestation AS with evolving HLHS and suggests that the gestational timing of development of significant AS has an important impact on subsequent left-heart growth in utero."

We therefore aimed to characterize features associated with tricuspid valve intervention. METHODS: All 219 children (1990-2007) who underwent Norwood stage 1 palliation resulting in a systemic right ventricle were investigated. In parametric competing risks analyses, primary end points included surgical tricuspid valve intervention (repair = 27, replacement = 3) and death (N = 105). All 2705 echocardiogram reports were included in time-related analyses of outcome adjusted for repeated measures. Variable selection used bootstrapping. RESULTS: Approximately 25% of survivors underwent tricuspid valve repair at some point, especially in children with mitral atresia (P = .04, 53% reliability), longer myocardial ischemic time during Norwood (P = .02, 50%), and moderate/severe tricuspid regurgitation immediately post-Norwood (P = .006, 86%). Risk of tricuspid valve intervention was mainly early, but a late risk emerged 10 to 15 years after Norwood. Tricuspid valve intervention was successful in restoring functional natural history to that of the remainder of the cohort. Tricuspid valve intervention did not compromise survival (82% ± 2% 5 years after tricuspid valve intervention), and right ventricular function was not worse in patients requiring tricuspid valve intervention. Repeat tricuspid valve interventions were undertaken in 6 patients (3 repairs, 3 replacements). At latest follow-up, the degree of tricuspid valve regurgitation was not different between those who did and did not receive intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid valve surgery is common after single ventricle palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, necessary in up to 25% of survivors. Mitral atresia and lengthy myocardial ischemic times during Norwood surgery are prominent risks. Right ventricular function was preserved by tricuspid repair. However, the emerging late hazard for tricuspid valve intervention may have implications for long-term outcome and should be explored further."

In this report, we describe a case of this cardiomyopathy occurring in an asymptomatic 50-year-old male with a remote history of a surgically corrected patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), primarily using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to illustrate the imaging characteristics. This patient had been referred to our institution for an abnormal electrocardiogram, and TTE subsequently (Figure 1) revealed a dilated left ventricle with moderately to severely reduced function; LV ejection fraction was 30% by two- and three-dimensional quantification. The left ventricle had a spherical appearance with a thin-walled, truncated, and akinetic distal LV. The right ventricle appeared elongated and was noted to wrap around the distal left ventricle, but right ventricular systolic function was normal. There were no significant valvular abnormalities, and no evidence of residual PDA flow. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging confirmed these findings (Figure 1). The TTE and CMR findings seen in this patient are consistent with LV apical hypoplasia. Until now, this cardiomyopathy has been described only as an isolated congenital anomaly primarily using CMR and cardiac computed tomography. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of LV apical hypoplasia in conjunction with another congenital cardiac abnormality, and the findings demonstrate that the distinctive appearance of this cardiomyopathy can be easily identified with echocardiography. As more cases are recognized and patients are followed over time, the natural history and optimal treatment for this cardiomyopathy may be further elucidated."

The incidence varies based upon the disorder and typically ranges from 1 in 500,000 to 1 per million population. Symptoms vary with the disorder and residual level of the clotting factor, and can range from relatively minor such as epistaxis, to life threatening, such as intracranial hemorrhage. Rapid treatment of bleeding episodes in individuals with severe bleeding phenotypes is essential to preserve life or limb and to prevent long-term sequelae; therapeutic options depend on the deficiency and range from plasma-derived (eg, fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, factor X concentrate) to highly purified and recombinant single factor concentrates. The rarity of these disorders limits the feasibility of conventional prospective clinical trials; instead, clinicians rely upon registries, published case reports/series and experience to guide treatment. In some disorders, long-term prophylactic therapy is administered in response to the bleeding phenotype in an individual patient or based on the known natural history and severity of the deficiency. Intermittent prophylaxis, surrounding surgery, pregnancy, labor, and menstruation may be required to prevent or control excessive bleeding.

In COC-users, mild and severe thrombophilia increased the risk of VTE almost 6-fold (rate ratio [RR], 5.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.21-8.23) and 7-fold (RR, 7.15; 95% CI, 2.93-17.45), respectively. The cohort studies showed that absolute VTE risk was far higher in COC-users with severe thrombophilia than in those with mild thrombophilia (4.3 to 4.6 vs. 0.49 to 2.0 per 100 pill-years, respectively), and these differences in absolute risks were also noted in non-affected women (0.48 to 0.7 vs. 0.19 to 0.0), but with the caveat that absolute risks were estimated in relatives of thrombophilic patients with VTE (i.e. with a positive family history). Conclusion These results support discouraging COC-use in women with severe hereditary thrombophilia. By contrast, additive VTE risk of mild thrombophilia is modest. When no other risk factors are present, (e.g. family history) COCs can be offered to these women when reliable alternative contraceptives are not tolerated."

Many herbal medicines/plant extracts have been reported to interact with the natural blood clotting system. In continuation to this effort, thirty medicinal plant extracts were allowed to interact with citrated human blood and the clotting time was measured after re-calcification in vitro using Lee and White method. The aq. leaf ext. of Syzygium cumini and Camellia sinensis significantly prolonged the clotting time. In response to the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time tests, the ext. of C. sinensis showed normal APTT and marginally prolonged the PT to 16.7 s (control-15.2 s) while S. cumini showed normal PT but significantly prolonged the APTT to 66.9 s (control-20.7 s). This suggests that, C. sinensis acts on the extrinsic pathway while S. cumini on the intrinsic pathway. There are some common herbal formulations that are frequently used by the patients which contain above plant materials, like, Syzygium cumin in anti-diabetic formulations, while the ext. of C. sinensis is consumed frequently as beverage in many part of the world. Hence, patients having known bleeding tendency or haemophilia disease should take into account the interaction potential of these plants with the natural blood clotting system while taking herbal formulations containing above plants; specially, the patients suffering from intrinsic pathway factor deficiency should keep a limit on the consumption of S. cumini while extrinsic pathway factor deficiency patients should limit C. sinensis. Also, the medical practitioners should consider the patient's food consumption history before doing any major surgical procedures."

A review of the Guidelines from Scientific Societies and Working Groups.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23846575,"The clinical penetrance of venous thromboembolism (VTE) susceptibility genes is variable, being lower in heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210A (mild thrombophilia), and higher in the rare carriers of deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C or S, and those with multiple or homozygous abnormalities (high-risk thrombophilia). The absolute risk of VTE is low, and the utility of laboratory investigation for inherited thrombophilia in patients with VTE and their asymptomatic relatives has been largely debated, leading to the production of several Guidelines from Scientific Societies and Working Groups. The risk for VTE largely depends on the family history of VTE. Therefore, indiscriminate search for carriers is of no utility, and targeted screening is potentially more fruitful. In patients with VTE inherited thrombophilia is not scored as a determinant of recurrence, playing a minor role in the decision of prolonging anticoagulation; indeed, a few guidelines consider testing worthwhile to identify carriers of high-risk thrombophilia, particularly those with a family history of VTE. The identification of the asymptomatic carrier relatives of the probands with VTE and thrombophilia could reduce cases of provoked VTE, offering them primary antithrombotic prophylaxis during risk situations. In most guidelines, this is considered justified only for relatives of probands with a deficiency of natural anticoagulants or multiple abnormalities. Counselling the asymptomatic female relatives of individuals with VTE and/or thrombophilia before pregnancy or the prescription of hormonal treatments should be administered with consideration of the risk driven by the type of thrombophilia and the family history of VTE."

The Austrian study on recurrent venous thromboembolism (AUREC).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23712242,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease, which often recurs. The recurrence risk is highest in patients with unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis (VT) or pulmonary embolism. Men have a higher risk than women. The risk is low in patients with VTE related to a temporary risk factor such as surgery or estrogen use. Other risk factors include overweight, post-thrombotic syndrome, history of VTE, residual VT or a vena cava filter. Both factor V Leiden and the prothrombin mutation confer a negligible increase in recurrence risk. High clotting factor levels, deficiency of a natural coagulation inhibitor, or hyperhomocysteinaemia are also associated with an increased risk. Reasons why routine laboratory thrombophilia screening however is no longer warranted are addressed in this article. Prediction rules combining clinical characteristics and coagulation assays have recently been developed. One such model, the Vienna Prediction Model, allows predicting recurrent VTE on the basis of VTE location, sex and D-dimer. This article describes strategies to distinguish between patients with high risk of recurrent VTE from those with a lower risk, who might not benefit from long-term antithrombotic therapy."

This seizure type is directly generated by hamartoma itself, intrinsically epileptogenic because of its anatomofunctional organization. Other types of seizures, focal or generalized, may appear during the evolution, probably resulting from mechanisms of secondary epileptogenesis. Nevertheless, the clinical expression and the severity of the syndrome, ranging from a focal drug-resistant epilepsy to a catastrophic generalized encephalopathy with severe cognitive and behavioral impairments, depends on the size and the site of attachment of the hamartoma.

Since the seminal publication in 1980, hypothalamic tumors have been recognized to be a cardinal feature of PHS. In their original description of the neuropathologic features of PHS, Clarren et al. coined the term ""hamartoblastoma"" to characterize what they deemed to be a dual malformative and neoplastic mass of the hypothalamus. In subsequent published cases/series of PHS, the term ""hamartoma"" was often substituted for hamartoblastoma given what appeared to be a benign natural history of this lesion. Additional confusion in the literature has ensued since most hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) encountered on the clinical neuropathology service are ""isolated"" in nature (ie, no other congenital malformations) and present in a very different and stereotypical fashion with gelastic seizures and/or precocious puberty. While genomic investigations of isolated HH have begun to uncover a mutational profile of these cases, GLI3 mutations have only been recognized in a small subset of isolated HH. Herein, we describe the autopsy findings from a 21-week gestational age fetus with features of PHS.

However, some patients, particularly those with other findings associated with Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), have a more benign course. METHODS: Thirty-seven of 40 PHS patients and 16 of 16 patients with isolated HH had a lesion confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Records for all patients were reviewed for the following information: presence of seizures, age at seizure onset, seizure type, seizure frequency, number of antiepileptic medications (AEDs) at the time of evaluation, past AEDs, MRI characteristics of the HH, presence of endocrine dysfunction, and presence of developmental and behavioral problems. RESULTS: All isolated HH patients had a history of seizures, compared with 13 of 40 PHS patients (all PHS patients with seizures had hamartomas). In isolated HH, seizures started earlier in life, occurred more frequently, and were harder to control than those in patients with PHS. Isolated HH patients were more likely to have behavioral and developmental problems than were PHS patients. The T2 signal of the hamartoma was isointense to gray matter in the majority of PHS patients, but showed a significant increase in all but one patient with isolated HH. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with isolated HH have a distinct clinical phenotype, showing more severe seizures and neurologic dysfunction, HH showing increased T2 signal, and are more likely to have precocious puberty. In contrast, PHS patients usually have well-controlled seizures and other endocrine disturbances than precocious puberty. Patients with HH with or without seizures should be evaluated carefully for other clinical manifestations of PHS, particularly before surgery is considered."

Our assessment of their management suggests that resection using current microsurgical techniques is a valid treatment option if the patient has a normal pubertal endocrine makeup, if the hamartoma is pedunculated, and if the patient is young enough to require years of parenteral medical treatment. Such surgical treatment can be curative, and subsequent growth and development can be normal (patients 1 and 2). However, if the patient is near to pubertal age (patient 3) or if neurosurgical or gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue treatment is not available, the natural history (patient 4) suggests that the only undesirable effects are accelerated growth, tall stature for age, and premature sexual development during childhood, as well as the psychosocial problems that may accompany them. Adult height may be compromised, although the two patients who did not undergo a surgical procedure and did not receive gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue therapy are above the lower limits of the normal range of adult male height. Therefore, if the hamartoma is pedunculated and cessation of pubertal development is desired, resection of the hamartoma is a reasonable therapeutic option."

No optimal management recommendations exist. The objective of the present study is to characterize a large cohort of patients with HPRT deficiency, comparing Lesch-Nyhan Disease (LND) and its attenuated variants, with the purpose of helping clinicians in disease management and prognostic definition. METHODS:Genetic and clinical features of French and Italian patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HPRT deficiency were collected. RESULTS:A hundred and one patients were studied, including 66 LND, 22 HND (HPRT-related Neurological Dysfunction) and 13 HRH (HPRT-Related Hyperuricemia) patients. The clinical manifestations at onset were not specific, but associated with an orange coloration of diapers in 22% of patients. The overall neurological involvement was more severe in LND than in HND patients. Behavioural disturbances were not limited to self-injuries and were not exclusive of LND. Median age of involuntary movements and self-injuries appearance in LND was 1.0 and 3 years, respectively. Renal manifestations (66.3% of patients) occurred at any age with a median onset age of 1.1 years, while gout (25.7% of patients) appeared later in disease course (median onset age 18 years) and was more frequent in attenuated variants than in LND. HPRT activity and genotype showed a significant correlation with the severity of the neurological disease. On the contrary, there were no significant differences in the development of nephropathy or gout. For the treatment of neurological aspects, botulinum toxin injections, oral or intrathecal baclofen and gabapentin were partially efficacious and well tolerated, while deep brain stimulation was associated to a worsening of patients' condition. CONCLUSIONS:The present study improves the knowledge of the natural history of HPRT deficiency and could represent a starting point for the development of future management guidelines."

METHODS:We conducted a natural history study that reviewed medical records for gynecologic and reproductive health of all female patients with xeroderma pigmentosum aged older than 9 years examined at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We performed gynecologic and laboratory examinations on a subset of the patients. Women in a second subset, who could not be examined, were interviewed using a questionnaire. Women who were deceased or lost to follow-up formed a third subset. RESULTS:Sixty females with xeroderma pigmentosum aged older than 9 years (median 29 years, range 10-61 years) were evaluated at the NIH from 1971 to 2018. Of these 60, 31 had history, questionnaire, record review, and gynecologic evaluation; 14 had record review and questionnaire interview by telephone; and 15 had only NIH record review. Menarche in females with xeroderma pigmentosum occurred at a median age of 12.0 years (range 9-17 years), which was comparable with the U.S. general population. Among the 18 patients with menopause, the median age at menopause of 29.5 years (range 18-49.5 years) was more than 20 years younger than in the U.S. general population (52.9 years).

Here we investigate the repeated evolution of dark colouration (melanism) in eastern fox squirrels (Sciurus niger; hereafter ""fox squirrels"") and eastern gray squirrels (S. carolinensis; hereafter ""gray squirrels""). RESULTS:We show that convergent evolution of melanism has arisen by independent genetic mechanisms in two populations of the fox squirrel. In a western population, melanism is associated with a 24 bp deletion in the melanocortin-1-receptor gene (MC1RΔ24 allele), whereas in a south-eastern population, melanism is associated with a point substitution in the agouti signalling protein gene causing a Gly121Cys mutation. The MC1R∆24 allele is also associated with melanism in gray squirrels, and, remarkably, all the MC1R∆24 haplotypes are identical in the two species. Evolutionary analyses show that the MC1R∆24 haplotype is more closely related to other MC1R haplotypes in the fox squirrel than in the gray squirrel. Modelling supports the possibility of gene flow between the two species. CONCLUSIONS:The presence of the MC1R∆24 allele and melanism in gray squirrels is likely due to introgression from fox squirrels, although we cannot completely rule out alternative hypotheses including introgression from gray squirrels to fox squirrels, or an ancestral polymorphism. Convergent melanism in these two species of tree squirrels has evolved by at least two and probably three different evolutionary routes."

However, melanic alleles may have significant/subtle pleiotrophic ""costs."" Several potential pleiotrophic effects of the W (=Y)-linked melanism gene in Papilio glaucus L. (Lepidoptera) showed no costs for melanic versus yellow in adult size, oviposition preferences, fecundity, egg viability, larval survival/growth rates, cold stress tolerance, or postdiapause emergence times. Sexual selection (males choosing yellow rather than mimetic dark females) had been suggested to provide a balanced polymorphism in P. glaucus, but spermatophore counts in wild females and direct field tethering studies of size-matched pairs of virgin females (dark and yellow), show that male preferences are random or frequency-dependent from Florida to Michigan, providing no yellow counter-advantages. Recent frequency declines of dark (melanic/mimetic) females in P. glaucus populations are shown in several major populations from Florida (27.3°N latitude) to Ohio (38.5° N). Summer temperatures have increased significantly at all these locations during this time (1999-2018), but whether dark morphs may be more vulnerable (in any stage) to such climate warming remains to be determined. Additional potential reasons for the frequency declines in mimetic females are discussed: (i) genetic introgression of Z-linked melanism suppressor genes from P. canadensis (R & J) and the hybrid species, P. appalachiensis (Pavulaan & Wright), (ii) differential developmental incompatibilities, or Haldane effects, known to occur in hybrids, (iii) selection against intermediately melanic (""dusty"") females (with the W-linked melanic gene, b+) which higher temperatures can cause."

Animals receiving a similar volume of water or alcohol served as controls. Significant pulmonary hypertension was noted in the experimental group, as evidenced by a significantly increased right to left ventricular wall ratio to 1.6 +/- 0.1 in the 4-day treatment group, as compared with 1.2 +/- 0.4 in the control group (P < 0.01). The smooth muscle area for <25 microm external diameter arterial vessels was significantly increased (12.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 10.0 +/- 0.6 microm; P < 0.01) and the adventitial area of all diameters vessels was significantly greater (P < 0.01) following 3 days of indomethacin treatment, as compared with water controls. Associated with these changes, the 4-day treatment group's lung/body weight ratio was 0.021 +/- 0.001, and was significantly less (P < 0.01) than for the control group (0.035 +/- 0.001). This reduction in lung weight was not associated with changes in lung protein content or wet/dry weight ratio, indicating that pulmonary hypertension in the fetal rat induced lung hypoplasia. In conclusion, closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetal rat results in early-onset right ventricular hypertrophy, followed by pulmonary vascular remodeling and lung hypoplasia. We speculate that lung growth in late gestation is adversely affected by pulmonary hypertension."

MPZ mutations are the second leading cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1. Recent research makes clinical trials for patients with MPZ mutations a realistic possibility. However, the clinical severity varies with different mutations and natural history data on progression is sparse. We present cross-sectional data to begin to define the phenotypic spectrum and clinical baseline of patients with these mutations. A cohort of patients with MPZ gene mutations was identified in 13 centres of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium - Rare Disease Clinical Research Consortium (INC-RDCRC) between 2009 and 2012 and at Wayne State University between 1996 and 2009. Patient phenotypes were quantified by the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease neuropathy score version 1 or 2 and the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease paediatric scale outcome instruments. Genetic testing was performed in all patients and/or in first- or second-degree relatives to document mutation in MPZ gene indicating diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B. There were 103 patients from 71 families with 47 different MPZ mutations with a mean age of 40 years (range 3-84 years). Patients and mutations were separated into infantile, childhood and adult-onset groups. The infantile onset group had higher Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease neuropathy score version 1 or 2 and slower nerve conductions than the other groups, and severity increased with age. Twenty-three patients had no family history of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Sixty-one patients wore foot/ankle orthoses, 19 required walking assistance or support, and 10 required wheelchairs. There was hearing loss in 21 and scoliosis in 17. Forty-two patients did not begin walking until after 15 months of age. Half of the infantile onset patients then required ambulation aids or wheelchairs for ambulation. Our results demonstrate that virtually all MPZ mutations are associated with specific phenotypes. Early onset (infantile and childhood) phenotypes likely represent developmentally impaired myelination, whereas the adult-onset phenotype reflects axonal degeneration without antecedent demyelination. Data from this cohort of patients will provide the baseline data necessary for clinical trials of patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease caused by MPZ gene mutations."

In both cases involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is unusual: brain myofibromas are usually intracranial in proximity of the dura mater, with infiltration of the calvarial bones and secondary brain compression. Spine myofibromas are exceptional and most of the cases reported in the literature represent secondary locations of visceral lesions. The natural history of myofibromas of the CNS in infantile myofibromatosis is characterized by a period of rapid growth, subsequent stabilization, and spontaneous regression in many cases. On these grounds surgical treatment is reserved for lesions that compress the brain or spinal cord and show an obvious progression. Small lesions or tumor residuals in asymptomatic children without visceral involvement should be closely observed as first choice.We report the case of a 10-month-old child with a solitary intramedullary myofibroma, extended from C7 to the conus.

L-serine supplementation is a possible candidate therapy but the lack of responsive outcome measures is a barrier for undertaking clinical trials in HSN1. We performed a 12-month natural history study to characterise the phenotype of HSN1 and to identify responsive outcome measures. METHODS:Assessments included Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score version 2 (CMTNSv2), CMTNSv2-Rasch modified, nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, intraepidermal nerve fibre density (thigh), computerised myometry (lower limbs), plasma 1-deoxysphingolipid levels, calf-level intramuscular fat accumulation by MRI and patient-based questionnaires (Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory and 36-Short Form Health Survey version 2 [SF-36v2]). RESULTS:35 patients with HSN1 were recruited. There was marked heterogeneity in the phenotype mainly due to differences between the sexes: males generally more severely affected. The outcome measures that significantly changed over 1 year and correlated with CMTNSv2, SF-36v2-physical component and disease duration were MRI determined calf intramuscular fat accumulation (mean change in overall calf fat fraction 2.36%, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.55, p=0.0004), pressure pain threshold on the hand (mean change 40 kPa, 95% CI 0.7 to 80, p=0.046) and myometric measurements of ankle plantar flexion (median change -0.5 Nm, IQR -9.5 to 0, p=0.0007), ankle inversion (mean change -0.89 Nm, 95% CI -1.66 to -0.12, p=0.03) and eversion (mean change -1.61 Nm, 95% CI -2.72 to -0.51, p=0.006).

In this article, we discuss the pathophysiology and principal findings of autonomic neuropathy in hATTR amyloidosis, the most common methods of assessment and progression, and its relation as a predictive risk factor or a measure of progression in the natural history of the disease. METHODS:A literature search was performed using the terms ""autonomic neuropathy,"" ""dysautonomia,"" and ""autonomic symptoms"" in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis and familial amyloid polyneuropathy. RESULTS:Various scales to measure autonomic function have been employed, particularly within the major clinical trials, to assess novel therapies for the disease. Most of the evaluations were taken from diabetic clinical trials. Questionnaires include the COMPASS-31 and Norfolk QOL autonomic nerve function domain, whereas clinical evaluations comprise HRDB and the orthostatic tolerance test. Several treatment options are being employed although only diflunisal and tafamidis have reported improvement in the autonomic abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS:Autonomic nerves are often affected before motor nerve impairment, and dysautonomia may support the diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis when differentiating from other adult-onset progressive neuropathies and from other types of amyloidosis. Most of the progression of autonomic dysfunction is seen in early stages of the disease, commonly before motor impairment or affection of the overall quality of life. Unfortunately, there is no current single standardized approach to evaluate dysautonomia in hATTR amyloidosis."

The UK population is unique in that the majority of patients have the T60A missense mutation in ATTR where tyrosine is replaced by adenine at position 60. This has been traced to a single founder mutation from north-west Ireland. The neuropathy phenotype is less well described than the cardiac manifestations in this group.We present the findings from an observational cohort study of patients with ATTR attending the National Hospital Inherited Neuropathy Clinic between 2009 and 2013. Detailed clinical neurological and electrophysiological data were collected on all patients alongside correlating autonomic and cardiac assessments. Follow-up data were available on a subset.Forty-four patients with genetically confirmed ATTR were assessed; 37 were symptomatic; mean age at onset=62 years, range=38-75 years; 75.7% male. T60A was the most common mutation (17/37), followed by V30M (5/37). A severe, rapidly progressive, predominantly length dependent axonal sensorimotor neuropathy was the predominant phenotype. T60A patients were distinguished by earlier and more frequent association with carpal tunnel syndrome; a predominance of negative sensory symptoms at onset; significant vibration deficits; and a non-length dependent progression of motor deficit. Progression of the neuropathy was observed over a relatively short follow-up period (2 years) in 20 patients with evidence of clinically measurable annual change in Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score (-1.5 points per year) and Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy Score (CMTNS:2.7 points per year), and a congruent trend in the electrophysiological measures used.The description of the ATTR neuropathy phenotype, especially in the T60A patients, should aid early diagnosis as well as contribute to the understanding of its natural history."

A late onset of a slowly progressive disease which reached its terminal stage after about 10  years was observed. The onset was mainly a length-dependent sensory neuropathy, although a focal onset with carpal tunnel syndrome was detected in three patients. At the onset of the disease, autonomic dysfunction was present in a small number of patients, but, within a few years, this had manifested in all members of the sample group. The only extra-neurological manifestations were cardiac related. It is reasonable to consider Southern Italy as an endemic focus of TTR-FAP. An underestimation of disease prevalence could be caused by a late onset of FAP, which can manifest in patients up to their late 70s. Follow-up of asymptomatic individuals may permit the early detection of symptoms and signs, allowing a detailed record of the natural history of the disease from the beginning and facilitating prompt treatment."

METHODS:We present clinical findings, laboratory test results, and imaging reports as well as follow-up on this unique presentation of T2DM. RESULTS:A 7-year-old girl was found unresponsive at home. Initial evaluation demonstrated severe DKA and diminished neurologic status. CT-scan of the head did not demonstrate cerebral edema. Her neurologic status deteriorated dramatically on four separate occasions requiring reintubation twice. She was transitioned to intensive insulin management, requiring up to 2 units/kg/day insulin. Her insulin sensitivity improved dramatically prior to discharge. Now 18 months from diagnosis, she remains on basal insulin and metformin. CONCLUSIONS:New-onset T2DM is an increasing event in youth. Reports suggest that these youth may acutely deteriorate as opposed to the typical longer duration of onset in youth with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus. Attention to effective screening of those at risk and increasing public awareness of T2DM in youth is important and may reduce the risk of such dreadful presentations as described in the current report. The balance between insulin deficiency and insulin resistance is variable at different phases of the condition. This highlights the need for study of the natural history of T2DM in youth."

Ages ranged from 5 to 22 y. Estimates of insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR)); insulin sensitivity (ratio of fasting glucose (GF) to fasting insulin (IF) (GF/IF), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)), and pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA-derived beta-cell function (HOMA %B)) were derived from fasting measurements. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in 192 patients to determine the presence of IGT. RESULTS: Insulin resistance was detected in 81.2% of the patients, IGT in 13.5%, and silent diabetes in one adolescent girl. Only two patients with IGT also had impaired fasting glucose (IFG). The prevalence of IGT was higher in adolescents than prepubertal children (14.7 vs 8.6%). GF/IF and QUICKI decreased significantly during puberty (P<0.005), whereas HOMA-IR and HOMA %B did not. Insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity indexes were not associated with ethnicity, presence of acanthosis nigricans or family history of type 2 diabetes. Patients with obesity complications had lower insulin sensitivity indexes than those without (P=0.05). Compared with subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), patients with IGT had significantly higher fasting blood glucose (85.9+/-6.5 vs 89.2+/-10.6 mg/dl, P<0.05), higher 2-h post-OGGT insulin levels (101.2+/-74.0 vs 207.6+/-129.7 microU/ml, P<0.001), a lower QUICKI (0.323+/-0.031 vs 0.309+/-0.022, P<0.05), and higher fasting triglyceride levels (117.4+/-53.1 vs 156.9+/-68.9, P=0.002). However, several of the fasting indexes except QUICKI failed to predict IGT. There was no difference between the group with IGT and the group with NGT in fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HOMA %B or the male-to-female ratio, age, BMI-SDS, presence of acanthosis nigricans, ethnicity, and family history of type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS:Insulin resistance is highly prevalent in obese children and adolescents. The onset of IGT is associated with the development of severe hyperinsulinemia as there are no predictive cutpoint values of insulin resistance or insulin sensitivity indexes for IGT, and neither fasting blood glucose nor insulin levels nor HOMA-IR or HOMA %B are effective screening tools; an OGTT is required in all subjects at high risk.

The 11 patients ranged in age from 7 to 32 years at presentation. All 11 patients had extreme insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, and hyperandrogenism in the female patients, and all but 1 were of normal body weight. This phenotype strongly predicts mutations in the insulin receptor: of the 8 patients studied, 7 were found to have mutations. Similar results from the literature are found in other patients with type A and Rabson-Mendenhall syndromes and leprechaunism. The hyperandrogenic state resulting from hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in these patients was extreme: 6 of 8 patients had ovarian surgery to correct the polycystic ovarian syndrome and elevation of serum testosterone. By contrast, a larger group of insulin-resistant patients who were obese with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans (HAIR-AN syndrome) did not have a high probability of mutations in the insulin receptor. The morbidity and mortality of these patients were high: 3 of 11 died, 9 of 11 were diabetic and 1 had impaired glucose tolerance, and 7 of 9 patients had 1 or more severe complication of diabetes. Our literature review revealed that the mortality of leprechaunism is so high that the term leprechaunism should be restricted to infants or young children under 2 years of age. Analogous to patients with the common forms of type 2 diabetes, these patients had a heterogeneous course. In 2 patients who were able to maintain extremely high endogenous insulin production, the fasting blood glucose remained normal even though post-glucose-challenge levels were elevated. Most patients, however, required large doses of exogenous insulin to ameliorate the severe hyperglycemia.

Whereas a growing number of single genetic diseases affecting satiety or energy metabolism have been found to produce the clinical phenotype, strong familial occurrences, especially in racially prone groups such as those from the Indian subcontinent, or individuals of African, Hispanic, and American Indian descents, together with emerging genetic findings, are revealing the polygenetic nature of the syndrome. However, the strong lifestyle factors of excessive carbohydrate and fat consumption and lack of exercise are important keys to the phenotypic expression of the syndrome. The natural history includes small for gestational age birth weight, excessive weight gains during childhood, premature pubarche, an allergic diathesis, acanthosis nigricans, striae compounded by gynecomastia, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, premature atherosclerosis, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and focal glomerulonephritis appearing increasingly through adolescence into adulthood. Type 2 diabetes, which develops because of an inherent and/or an acquired failure of an insulin compensatory response, is increasingly seen from early puberty onward, as is atheromatous disease leading to coronary heart disease and stroke. A predisposition to certain cancers and Alzheimer's disease is also now recognized. The looming tragedy from growing numbers of individuals affected by obesity/insulin resistance syndrome requires urgent public health approaches directed at their early identification and intervention during childhood.

On the grounds of prevalence of disease, both conditions account for a significant financial cost for health care systems and individuals. Aim of this review article is to explore the epidemiological basis and the putative molecular mechanisms underlying the association of NAFLD with T2D. Epidemiological studies have shown that NAFLD is associated to the development of incident T2D and either reversal or improvement of NAFLD will result into decreased risk of developing incident T2D. On the other side of the coin data have shown that T2D will worsen the course of NAFLD doubling the risk of disease progression (i.e. evolution from simple steatosis to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant and death). Conversely, NAFLD will contribute to metabolic decompensation of T2D. The pathogenesis of T2D in NAFLD patients may be mediated by several hepatokines impairing metabolic control. Among these, Fetuin-B, which causes glucose intolerance and is increased in patients with T2D and NAFLD with fibrosis is one of the most promising. T2D may affect the progression of NAFLD by acting at different levels of the pathogenic cascade involving gut microbiota and expanded, inflamed, dysfunctional adipose tissue. In conclusion, T2D and NAFLD are mutually, closely and bi-directionally associated. An improved understanding of molecular pathogenesis underlying this bi-directional association may allow us to be able to prevent the development of T2D by halting the progression of NAFLD."

AREAS COVERED:The present review intends to summarize what is already known regarding early STIT in T2DM and highlight questions and dilemmas from the clinician's point of view, with a discourse on future research agenda. EXPERT OPINION:STIT has the potential to modify the natural history of T2DM, resulting in improved drug-free remission rates by favorably affecting the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Existing data in the field manifest significant weaknesses, mainly being the small number of trials and patients included, the lack of control groups in most studies and the wide heterogeneity between study designs and explored outcomes, which limit definitive conclusions. Therefore, before such a therapeutic strategy is incorporated into daily practice, important issues require further clarification by future trials. These issues include the optimal time point for the intervention, the ideal insulin type, the identification of patients being most likely to benefit, the STIT effects on cardiovascular and other clinical outcomes and the cost-effectiveness evaluation of this therapeutic strategy.

We analyzed the efficacy of combined immunosuppressive therapy in the management of this extreme form of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:We performed a prospective cohort study including patients with confirmed insulin receptor autoantibodies, monitored for median 72 months (25th, 75th interquartile range 25, 88), and treated with rituximab, high-dose pulsed steroids, and cyclophosphamide until remission, followed by maintenance therapy with azathioprine. Remission was defined as the amelioration of the hyperglycemia and discontinuation of insulin and/or normalization of hyperandrogenemia. RESULTS:All data are given as median (25th, 75th interquartile range). Twenty-two patients aged 42 (25, 57) years, 86.4% women, fulfilled inclusion criteria. At baseline, fasting glucose was 307 (203, 398) mg/dL, HbA1c was 11.8% (9.7, 13.6), total testosterone (women) was 126 (57, 571) ng/dL (normal 8-60), and daily insulin requirement was 1,775 (863, 2,700) units. After 5 (4, 6.3) months, 86.4% (19 of 22) of patients achieved remission, documented by discontinuation of insulin in all patients, normal fasting glucose of 80 (76, 92) mg/dL, HbA1c of 5.5% (5.2, 6), and testosterone (women) of 28 (20, 47) ng/dL. During follow-up of 72 (25, 88) months, 13.6% (3 of 22) of patients developed disease recurrence, occurring 24 (22, 36) months after initial remission, which responded to repeated therapy. None of the patients died. CONCLUSIONS:Combined immunosuppressive therapy has changed the natural history of this disease, from 54% mortality to a curable form of diabetes and, as such, should be recommended in patients with type B insulin resistance."

Temporal changes in glycaemic traits during middle age suggest that impaired insulin secretion is a particular feature of diabetes development among South Asians. We therefore aimed to examine ethnic differences in early changes in glucose metabolism prior to incident type 2 diabetes. METHODS:In a prospective British occupational cohort, subject to 5 yearly clinical examinations, we examined ethnic differences in trajectories of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2 h post-load plasma glucose (2hPG), fasting serum insulin (FSI), 2 h post-load serum insulin (2hSI), HOMA of insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-S) and secretion (HOMA2-B), and the Gutt insulin sensitivity index (ISI0,120) among 120 South Asian and 867 white participants who developed diabetes during follow-up (1991-2013). We fitted cubic mixed-effects models to longitudinal data with adjustment for a wide range of covariates. RESULTS:Compared with white individuals, South Asians had a faster increase in FPG before diagnosis (slope difference 0.22 mmol/l per decade; 95% CI 0.02, 0.42; p = 0.03) and a higher FPG level at diagnosis (0.27 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.06, 0.48; p = 0.01). They also had higher FSI and 2hSI levels before and at diabetes diagnosis. South Asians had a faster decline and lower HOMA2-S (log e -transformed) at diagnosis compared with white individuals (0.33; 95% CI 0.21, 0.46; p < 0.001). HOMA2-B increased in both ethnic groups until 7 years before diagnosis and then declined; the initial increase was faster in white individuals. ISI0,120 declined steeply in both groups before diagnosis; levels were lower among South Asians before and at diagnosis. There were no ethnic differences in 2hPG trajectories. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:We observed different trajectories of plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity and secretion prior to diabetes diagnosis in South Asian and white individuals. This might be due to ethnic differences in the natural history of diabetes. South Asian individuals experienced a more rapid decrease in insulin sensitivity and faster increases in FPG compared with white individuals. These findings suggest more marked disturbance in beta cell compensation prior to diabetes diagnosis in South Asian individuals."

Inclusion criteria were animal studies examining the mechanism of action and efficacy of bromocriptine, and clinical studies examining the safety and efficacy of bromocriptine-QR in patients with T2DM, without a time limitation.The brain plays a key role in total body metabolism, in particular ensuring that sufficient levels of glucose are available for proper neural functioning. The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the body's biological clock, plays a key role in the regulation of seasonal and diurnal variations of insulin sensitivity. A daily surge of dopaminergic activity in the SCN upon waking enables insulin sensitivity throughout the day. When this is disrupted (e.g. by a high fat/sugar diet, stress, altered [diminished] exercise, altered sleep/wake cycle, diabetes), insulin resistance persists throughout the day and overnight. Improving the morning surge in dopaminergic activity with the short-acting dopamine D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine-QR can safely and effectively improve glycemic control, while improving cardiovascular disease risk factors and related adverse events, and reducing sympathetic tone, as demonstrated by 5 reports of the Cycloset Safety Trial and 3 additional clinical studies of bromocriptine-QR.In patients with T2DM, the dopamine D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine-QR has been shown to be well tolerated, efficacious, and a logical treatment option."

Surgical resection, but also endoscopic resection and observation, can be proposed for gastric NETs according to presentation, size and grade. For small bowel NETs, resection is frequently needed but should obtain the best compromise between radicality and postoperative functional disorders. Appendiceal NETs are frequently diagnosed by appendectomy for appendicitis, but some patients at high risk for lymph node metastasis and recurrence should be reoperated for radical resection. Rectal NETs are often diagnosed incidentally; the smallest (<1cm) can be resected endoscopically but the most aggressive need a oncological proctectomy. Pancreatic NETs represent a wide spectrum, ranging from fully benign tumors to very aggressive ones. Insulinomas are mostly benign, responsible for incapacitating symptoms despite medical treatment, and should ideally be treated by parenchyma sparing resection, mainly enucleation. Conversely, symptoms of gastrinomas are efficiently treated medically but their resection needs an oncological approach. Nonfunctioning PNETs are more and more frequently and incidentally discovered. According to their size, presentation and patient's characteristics, they need a resection (oncological or parenchyma-sparing) or a close observation."

In this study, the authors report a consecutive series of patients with pure arterial malformations, emphasizing the clinical and radiological features of these lesions. METHODS Pure arterial malformations were defined as dilated, overlapping, and tortuous arteries with a coil-like appearance and/or a mass of arterial loops without any associated venous component. Demographic characteristics of the patients, cardiovascular risk factors, presentation, radiological characteristics, and follow-up data were collected. Primary outcomes were new neurological symptoms including disability, stroke, and hemorrhage. RESULTS Twelve patients meeting the criteria were identified. Ten patients were female (83.3%) and 2 were male (16.6%). Their mean age at diagnosis was 26.2 ± 11.6 years. The most common imaging indication was headache (7 patients [58.3%]). In 3 cases the pure arterial malformation involved the anterior cerebral arteries (25.0%); in 4 cases the posterior communicating artery/posterior cerebral artery (33.3%); in 2 cases the middle cerebral artery (16.6%); and in 1 case each, the superior cerebellar artery, basilar artery/anterior inferior cerebellar artery, and posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The mean maximum diameter of the malformations was 7.2 ± 5.0 mm (range 3-16 mm). Four lesions had focal aneurysms associated with the pure arterial malformation, and 5 were partially calcified. In no cases was there associated intracranial hemorrhage or infarction. One patient underwent treatment for the pure arterial malformation. All 12 patients had follow-up (mean 29 months, median 19 months), and there were no cases of disability, stroke, or hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Pure arterial malformations are rare lesions that are often detected incidentally and probably have a benign natural history. These lesions can affect any of the intracranial arteries and are likely best managed conservatively."

Since its introduction in the 1950s, long-term follow-up would appear to show that only 30% to 50% of patients have a good long-term prognosis despite initially good surgical outcome. The authors reviewed their experience in treating BA from 1968 to 1997 to assess long-term outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS:The records of 163 patients treated surgically for BA from 1968 to 1997 were reviewed. Forty-eight (29%) were alive at the end of 1997, of whom, 14 had received liver transplants (LT). Surviving patients who had not undergone transplantation were divided into two groups according to clinical condition: group A, normal liver function without cholangitis (CG) and portal hypertension (PH) and group B, liver dysfunction with CG or PH. The study period was divided arbitrarily into three periods, 1968 to 1975 (period I, n = 34); 1976 to 1985 (period II, n = 81); 1986 to 1997 (period III, n = 48). RESULTS:Thirty-four patients were alive without LT at the end of 1997. There were eight patients (mean age, 16.3+/-4.8 years) in group A, and 26 patients (mean age, 14.3+/-7.6 years) in group B. Recently, four group A patients (mean age, 19.3+/-1.9 years) shifted to group B because of sudden deterioration in condition involving severe CG with multiple bile lakes (n = 2), uncontrollable intestinal bleeding (n = 1), and liver atrophy (n = 1). Survival deteriorated with length of follow-up. There were three survivors from 34 patients treated in period I, 16 survivors from 81 patients treated in period II (three had LT), and 29 survivors from 48 patients treated in period III (11 had LT). CONCLUSIONS:Although satisfactory bile drainage can be obtained with portoenterostomy, our data suggest that liver function can deteriorate progressively, with a possible turning point in late adolescence, indicating that as the length of follow-up increases, clinical assessment should be regular and comprehensive. The timing of LT in postoperative BA patients with deteriorating liver function is a vital management issue."

Bleeding, although common with spinal arteriovenous malformations and spinal cord tumors, rarely occurs with ruptured isolated spinal artery aneurysms.

CASE DESCRIPTION:A 67-year-old woman presented with sudden-onset nausea and low back and right thigh pain that worsened with movement. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head suggested a small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the high-convexity sulcus, and lumbar puncture showed bloody cerebrospinal fluid. There was no apparent intracranial aneurysm on CT angiography; however, spinal MRI showed a lesion on the right side of the spinal cord at Th10. Contrast-enhanced CT showed an enhancing lesion at this site on day 7 that was not present on day 15. Selective right Th10 intercostal artery angiography on day 22 showed no evidence of aneurysm. The lesion was suspected to be a thrombotic spinal artery aneurysm. Given the unclear natural history of this entity, surgery was performed on day 36. After right Th10 hemilaminectomy and opening the dura, the arachnoid and adhesions were found to be thickened. A fusiform-shaped thrombosed aneurysm continuous with the radiculopial artery was removed. The patient was discharged without neurologic deterioration. CONCLUSIONS:Isolated spinal artery aneurysm is a rare cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is expected that additional cases will clarify the natural history and indications for treatment."

This association is consider as therapeutic challenge and supportive data about their natural history and best treatment modalities are still lacking. In this article we report our experience of their treatment. We reviewed 443 cases of patients with AVMs between 2004 and 2018, who were treated at our institution and found 73 (16,5%) cases of AVM association with paranidal aneurysms (22 (30,2%) arterial - prenidal, 20 (27,4%) intranidal, and 19 (26,0%) venous - postnidal). Twelve (16,4 %) patients had multiple aneurysm. All patients received endovascular treatment with n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA), ONYX or Embolin embolization. We evaluated clinical and radiological data, treatment and outcomes at discharge. Among 73 patients (32 (43,8 %) women and 41 (56,2 %) men, mean age - 34 years, 8 - 65 years) with AVM and paranidal aneurysms who were enrolled in our study, hemorrhage was the most frequent presenting symptom (47 patients (64.4%). The timing of procedure varied between 3 - 23 days. Total occlusion of AVM was achieved in 23 (31,5%) cases, in all other cases partial or target occlusion with obligatory aneurysm embolization was done. Seven (9,6%) patients had complication (5 ischemic and 2 hemorrhagic) after procedure. Clinical improvement was seen in all groups at discharge. Mean change of mRS score between admission and discharge was 0,2-0,5 point. Excellent or good outcome (mRS - 0,1,2) was observed in 58 (79,5%) patients at discharge. Unfavorable outcome (mRS - 3-5) had 13 (17,8%) patients, mRS - 6 - 2 (2,7%) patients. Patients sustaining AVM and multiple paranidal aneurysms had higher risk of hemorrhage comparing with single one (OR-17,5 (95% CI -1,0-309,8 (p=0,010). Relationship between AVM with paranidal aneurysms and hemorrhagic presentation is obvious, however definite source of hemorrhage is difficult to evaluate.

Endovascular embolization has the potential to be effective and safe in treatment of AVM with paranidal aneurysms."

Although it has been described for several years, the real pathophysiological mechanisms, the natural history and the possible neoplastic complications are not completely known. Atrophy of the gastric mucosa is the endpoint of the chronic processes, with the loss of glandular cells and their replacement by intestinal-type epithelium, pyloric-type glands, and fibrous tissue. As a consequence, hydrochloric acid, pepsin and intrinsic-factor is impaired resulting in pernicious anemia. The exact causal agent is not yet known, but both genetic and environmental factors seem to play a decisive role. Moreover, the clinical onset may assume different characteristics; differently from what previously observed, recent evidence has reported the onset of CAAG at a younger age, frequently with iron deficiency anemia or upper gastro-intestinal symptoms. The diagnosis of CAAG might be challenging and usually requires the combination of clinical, serological and histopathologic data; moreover, CAAG patients are often misdiagnosed as refractory to HP eradication therapy, probably because achlorhydria might allow urease-positive bacteria other than H pylori to colonize the stomach, causing positive 13C-urea breath test results. However, biopsy is the most reliable method to evaluate the presence of metaplastic atrophic gastritis. In order to assess the severity of gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, OLGA and OLGIM staging systems have been proposed and seem to correlate with the risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma. Indeed, CAAG represents a pre-neoplastic condition, as patients with CAAG are very likely to develop either type-1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors and gastric adenocarcinomas, as well as several other neoplastic diseases. To date, the need, the intervals and cost-effectiveness of endoscopic/histological surveillance for patients with CAAG/pernicious anemia are yet to be established."

This heterogeneity appears to constitute the underlying cause for the focal cell hyperplasia and eventually the formation of thyroid and adrenal nodules, under the influence of growth stimulatory factors. Among the main stimulatory factors are the pituitary tropic hormones, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyrotropin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which regulate the growth and function of their respective target cells, and the insulin/insulin-like growth factor system, that, through its mitogenic effects, can stimulate the proliferation of these cells. The predominance of one or the other of these growth stimulatory factors appears to determine the natural history of thyroid and adrenal nodular disease. Thus, iodine deficiency was, in the past, the main pathogenic factor responsible, through a transient rise in TSH secretion, for the endemic nodular goiter with the characteristic colloid thyroid nodules among the inhabitants in iodine deficient areas. The correction of iodine deficiency was followed by the elimination of endemic colloid goiter and the emergence of thyroid autoimmunity. The recent epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS), or insulin resistance syndrome, has been associated with the re-emergence of nodular thyroid disease. A parallel rise in the incidence of benign, nonfunctional adrenocortical tumors, known as adrenal incidentalomas, has also been reported in association with the manifestations of the MS. It is likely that the compensatory to insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia may be responsible for the rising trend of thyroid and adrenal nodular disease in the current environment."

Many herbal medicines/plant extracts have been reported to interact with the natural blood clotting system. In continuation to this effort, thirty medicinal plant extracts were allowed to interact with citrated human blood and the clotting time was measured after re-calcification in vitro using Lee and White method. The aq. leaf ext. of Syzygium cumini and Camellia sinensis significantly prolonged the clotting time. In response to the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time tests, the ext. of C. sinensis showed normal APTT and marginally prolonged the PT to 16.7 s (control-15.2 s) while S. cumini showed normal PT but significantly prolonged the APTT to 66.9 s (control-20.7 s). This suggests that, C. sinensis acts on the extrinsic pathway while S. cumini on the intrinsic pathway. There are some common herbal formulations that are frequently used by the patients which contain above plant materials, like, Syzygium cumin in anti-diabetic formulations, while the ext. of C. sinensis is consumed frequently as beverage in many part of the world. Hence, patients having known bleeding tendency or haemophilia disease should take into account the interaction potential of these plants with the natural blood clotting system while taking herbal formulations containing above plants; specially, the patients suffering from intrinsic pathway factor deficiency should keep a limit on the consumption of S. cumini while extrinsic pathway factor deficiency patients should limit C. sinensis.

Long thought hypochondriacal, these findings, plus their time course and her psychopathology (irritability, delusions, hallucinations, with preserved clarity), are all consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. Pernicious anemia most probably caused this deficiency: she lacked risk factors for other causes, and her consanguineous parents both derived from a region of Scotland having a high incidence of pernicious anemia. A diagnosis of chronic multisystem pernicious anemia would clarify the conduct of Mary Lincoln as First Lady and widow, and illuminate challenges faced by her husband, President Abraham Lincoln.

We incidentally encountered electromyographic evidence of this syndrome in a patient being studied for another reason. The patient had controlled hypothyroidism and smoked for 9 pack-years but never had symptoms of weakness or had evidence of cancer. METHODS: Detailed electrophysiological and serological evaluations were undertaken in this study. RESULTS: Neuromuscular transmission tests were consistent with a presynaptic disorder. Autoantibodies specific for P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) were detected in the serum and persisted throughout 7 years of follow-up. Multiple IgG markers of thyrogastric autoimmunity also were detected. CONCLUSIONS: This demonstration of asymptomatic Lambert-Eaton syndrome persisting for 8 years provided novel insight into the natural history of the disorder. It is plausible that patients with a subclinical syndrome would have abrupt neuromuscular decompensation when challenged with medications that compromise the safety factor for synaptic transmission.

We aimed to analyse the characteristics and rate of progression of CLN2 disease in an international cohort of patients. METHODS:We did an observational cohort study using data from two independent, international datasets of patients with untreated genotypically confirmed CLN2 disease: the DEM-CHILD dataset (n=74) and the Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) dataset (n=66). Both datasets included quantitative rating assessments with disease-specific clinical domain scores, and disease course was measured longitudinally in 67 patients in the DEM-CHILD cohort. We analysed these data to determine age of disease onset and diagnosis, as well as disease progression-measured by the rate of decline in motor and language summary scores (on a scale of 0-6 points)-and time from first symptom to death. FINDINGS:In the combined DEM-CHILD and WCMC dataset, median age was 35·0 months (IQR 24·0-38·5) at first clinical symptom, 37·0 months (IQR 35·0 -42·0) at first seizure, and 54·0 months (IQR 47·5-60·0) at diagnosis. Of 74 patients in the DEM-CHILD dataset, the most common first symptoms of disease were seizures (52 [70%]), language difficulty (42 [57%]), motor difficulty (30 [41%]), behavioural abnormality (12 [16%]), and dementia (seven [9%]). Among the 41 patients in the DEM-CHILD dataset for whom longitudinal assessments spanning the entire disease course were available, a rapid annual decline of 1·81 score units (95% CI 1·50-2·12) was seen in motor-language summary scores from normal (score of 6) to no function (score of 0), which occurred over approximately 30 months. Among 53 patients in the DEM-CHILD cohort with available data, the median time between onset of first disease symptom and death was 7·8 years (SE 0·9) years. INTERPRETATION:In view of its natural history, late-infantile CLN2 disease should be considered in young children with delayed language acquisition and new onset of seizures. CLN2 disease has a largely predictable time course with regard to the loss of language and motor function, and these data might serve as historical controls for the assessment of current and future therapies.

Onset of visual failure around 6 years of age is thought to precede cognitive deterioration by a few years, but casuistic reports question this paradigm.

METHODS:Early neurocognitive functioning in CLN3 disease was analyzed using age at onset of visual and cognitive decline and IQ scores from literature-derived patient descriptions, supplemented with IQ scores and school history from a retrospective referral center cohort. We analyzed protracted and classical CLN3 separately and added a control group of patients diagnosed with juvenile onset macular degeneration (early onset Stargardt disease) to control for possible effects of rapid vision loss on neurocognitive functioning. RESULTS:Onset of cognitive decline at a mean age of 6.8 years (range 2-13 years, n = 19) paralleled onset of visual deterioration at a mean age of 6.4 years (range 4-9 years, n = 81) as supported by an early decline in IQ scores in classical CLN3 disease. Onset and course of vision loss was similar in patients with protracted CLN3. The decreased IQ levels at diagnosis (mean 68.4, range 57-79, n = 9) in the referral cohort were consistently associated with an aberrant early school history contrasting normal school history and cognition in Stargardt disease patients.

METHOD: A family tree was constructed that included 66 blood relatives from three successive generations. Electrocardiograms were obtained from 59 living members including the proband, four members from a nuclear family, and 54 from the extended family. Evoked response audiometry was recorded for the proband and the nuclear family. All 59 family members were followed up regularly for 16 years. RESULTS: A total of 24 living members were affected--QTc: 480-680 ms. The proband had long QTc, bilateral high-tone sensorineural deafness, recurrent syncope, and Torsades de Pointes. The asymptomatic father had long QTc and unilateral high-tone sensorineural deafness that involved specifically the left ear. One asymptomatic sibling of the proband had long QTc and normal hearing. The mother and another sibling were asymptomatic; QTc and hearing were normal in both. A total of 21 affected members from the extended family had only long QTc, and all were asymptomatic. There were three congenitally deaf first cousins who had recurrent syncope and adrenergic-triggered sudden death. In all, seven of 10 parents had consanguineous marriage to a first cousin.

Mild heart defects have been noted, but there have been no atrioventricular canal or heterotaxy defects that are common in Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome. We anticipate that the steady identification of molecularly defined patients may allow correlation of phenotype and genotype. Additional natural history data will improve genetic counseling and current guidelines."

Aspirin, the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and corticosteroids are used commonly in these conditions, but have little effect in altering the natural history and outcomes of inflammatory arthritis, which can lead to cartilage and joint destruction and severe disability. More important and diverse are the ""Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs"" (DMARDs) which are the mainstay of therapy in rheumatoid arthritis and have dramatically altered the outcome of these conditions, and improved the quality of life of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The initial DMARDs were the gold preparations which were first used in the 1930s. More potent and better tolerated agents followed in the 1950s and 1960s, including methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, azathioprine and the thiopurines. More modern DMARDs have included potent, small molecule immunosuppressive agents such as leflunomide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and mycophenolate. More recently, monoclonal antibodies and biologics have been developed that act on the primary cytokines and inflammatory pathways that are active and play a major role in rheumatoid arthritis. These important agents include the tumor necrosis factor antagonists, anticytokines (such as anakinra) and other major immunosuppressive agents (rituximab, abatacept, and tocilizumab). Agents used predominantly as antirheumatic drugs are listed below with specific links to the individual drugs.

Clinical and radiological phenotypes have been analysed carefully to further understand the aetiology behind. METHODS:Seven patients (three children around the age of 9-11 and one child of 17 years old). Three adults aging 25, 30, 33 and 40 years old were seen and examined. The paediatric group of patients were initially diagnosed with myopathy followed later by juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in other institutions. Clinical and imaging documentation were collected in our departments, followed by mutation screening, was carried out by bidirectional sequencing of the WISP3 gene. RESULTS:Clinical and radiological phenotypic studies confirmed the diagnosis of progressive pseudorheumatoid chondrodysplasia. A constellation of abnormalities such as early senile hyperostosis of the spine (Forestier disease), osteoarthritis of the hips showed progressive diminution and irregularities of the hip joint spaces associated with progressive capital femoral epiphyseal dysplasia and coxa vara have been encountered. Loss-of-function homozygous mutations (c.667T>G, p.Cys223Gly) and (c.170C>A, p.Ser57*) in the WISP3 gene were identified in our patients. CONCLUSION:The definite diagnosis was not defined via vigorous myopathic and rheumatologic investigations. Detailed clinical examination and skeletal survey, followed by genotypic confirmation, were our fundamental pointers to rule out the false diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid polyarthritis in the adult group of patients. We wish to stress that the clinical/radiological phenotype is the baseline tool to establish a definite diagnosis and to guide the geneticist toward proper genotype.Key Points•Joint pain and difficulties in walking/climbing the stairs are characteristic features encountered in early childhood. False diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis can be made at this point.•False positive-like muscular wasting resembling myopathy results in ensuing vigorous troublesome investigations.•Flattened vertebral bodies associated with defective ossification of the anterior end plates are characteristic features of progressive pseudorheumatoid chondrodysplasia.•Joint expansions, which are usually accompanied by narrowing of the articular ends of the appendicular skeletal system, show a clear radiological phenotype of pseudorheumatoid chondrodysplasia."

Less is known about the natural history of non-HFE HH caused by mutations in the HJV, HAMP, or TFR2 genes. The purpose of this study was to compare the phenotypic and clinical presentations of hepcidin-deficient forms of HH. A literature review of all published cases of genetically confirmed HJV, HAMP, and TFR2 HH was performed. Phenotypic and clinical data from a total of 156 patients with non-HFE HH was extracted from 53 publications and compared with data from 984 patients with HFE-p.C282Y homozygous HH from the QIMR Berghofer Hemochromatosis Database. Analyses confirmed that non-HFE forms of HH have an earlier age of onset and a more severe clinical course than HFE HH. HJV and HAMP HH are phenotypically and clinically very similar and have the most severe presentation, with cardiomyopathy and hypogonadism being particularly prevalent findings. TFR2 HH is more intermediate in its age of onset and severity. All clinical outcomes analyzed were more prevalent in the juvenile forms of HH, with the exception of arthritis and arthropathy, which were more commonly seen in HFE HH. This is the first comprehensive analysis comparing the different phenotypic and clinical aspects of the genetic forms of HH, and the results will be valuable for the differential diagnosis and management of these conditions. Importantly, our analyses indicate that factors other than iron overload may be contributing to joint pathology in patients with HFE HH."

Being aware of the importance of registries, the Portuguese Society of Rheumatology developed the Rheumatic Diseases Portuguese Register- Reuma.pt - which proved to be an innovative instrument essential to a better understanding of systemic immune-mediated rheumatic diseases.To describe the contribution of Reuma.pt to the knowledge of systemic immune-mediated rheumatic diseases.Reuma.pt is widely implemented, with 77 centres actively contributing to the recruitment and follow-up of patients. Reuma.pt follows in a standardized way patients with the following systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (n=6218), psoriatic arthritis (n=1498), spondyloarthritis (n=2529), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (n =1561), autoinflammatory syndromes (n=122), systemic lupus erythematosus (n =1718), systemic sclerosis (n=180) and vasculitis (n=221). This platform is intended for use as an electronic medical record, provides standardized assessment of patients and support to the clinical decision, thereby contributing to a better quality of care of rheumatic patients. The research based on Reuma.pt identified genetic determinants of susceptibility and response to therapy, characterized in detail systemic rheumatic diseases and their long-term impact, critically appraised the performance of instruments for monitoring the disease activity, established the effectiveness and safety of biologic therapies and identified predictors of response, and proactively engaged patients in the management of their disease.Reuma.pt is an innovative tool, widely established in the country that contributes to a clinical practice of excellence and simultaneously to increase the knowledge of systemic immune-mediated rheumatic diseases.

They were further validated using data from the PRINTO trial of prednisone alone compared to prednisone with methotrexate or cyclosporine and the Rituximab in Myositis (RIM) trial. At a consensus conference, experts considered 14 top candidate criteria based on their performance characteristics and clinical face validity, using nominal group technique. RESULTS:Consensus was reached for a conjoint analysis-based continuous model with a total improvement score of 0-100, using absolute percent change in core set measures of minimal (≥30), moderate (≥45), and major (≥70) improvement. The same criteria were chosen for adult DM/polymyositis, with differing thresholds for improvement. The sensitivity and specificity were 89% and 91-98% for minimal improvement, 92-94% and 94-99% for moderate improvement, and 91-98% and 85-86% for major improvement, respectively, in juvenile DM patient cohorts using the IMACS and PRINTO core set measures. These criteria were validated in the PRINTO trial for differentiating between treatment arms for minimal and moderate improvement (P = 0.009-0.057) and in the RIM trial for significantly differentiating the physician's rating for improvement (P < 0.006).

With the recent conceptual change, GCA is no longer considered a disease with mandatory cranial symptoms but, rather, a larger disease spectrum also including idiopathic aortitis in people older than 50 and polymyalgia rheumatica with large-vessel involvement. The incidence peak between age 70 and 80 years, greater frequency in females and greater occurrence in Nordic countries are well-established epidemiological characteristics. Conversely, the notion that the incidence of GCA is increasing is challenged by several recent population-based studies suggesting a trend reversal for about 15 to 20 years. The known link with the allele HLA-DRB1*04 was confirmed by a genome-wide association study that also found associations with two other genetic polymorphisms. Recent studies indicating a link with varicella zoster virus infection have invigorated the hypothesis of an infectious cause for GCA. Smoking is the most solidly recognized environmental risk factor, but other traditional cardiovascular risk factors do not seem to predispose to GCA. Evidence is mounting that overall mortality in GCA patients is at best slightly higher than expected in relation to general population mortality data, but GCA is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality specifically related to aortic aneurysm or other cardiovascular causes. Further studies are needed to integrate the current knowledge into a single etiological model."

Before a disease can be managed, it is essential to understand its natural history, so as to be able to assess the likely effectiveness of any intervention. I investigated natural history of visual outcome in prospective studies of 386 eyes with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-AION), 16 eyes with non-arteritic posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, 697 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), 67 eyes with hemi-CRVO (HCRVO), 216 eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), 260 eyes with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), 151 eyes with branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) and 61 eyes with cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO). My studies have shown that every one of these disorders consists of multiple distinct clinical sub-categories with different visual findings. When an ocular vascular occlusive disorder is caused by giant cell arteritis, which is an ophthalmic emergency, it would be unethical to do a natural history study of visual outcome in them, because in this case early diagnosis and immediate, intensive high-dose steroid therapy is essential to prevent any further visual loss, not only in the involved eye but also in the fellow, normal eye. In NA-AION in eyes seen ≤2 weeks after the onset, visual acuity (VA) improved in 41% of those with VA 20/70 or worse, and visual field (VF) improved in 26% of those with moderate to severe VF defect. In non-ischemic CRVO eyes with VA 20/70 or worse, VA improved in 47% and in ischemic CRVO in 23%; moderate to severe VF defect improved in 79% in non-ischemic CRVO and in 27% in ischemic CRVO. In HCRVO, overall findings demonstrated that initial VA and VF defect and the final visual outcome were different in non-ischemic from ischemic HCRVO - much better in the former than the latter. In major BRVO, in eyes with initial VA of 20/70 or worse, VA improved in 69%, and moderate to severe VF defect improved in 52%. In macular BRVO with 20/70 or worse initial VA, it improved in 53%, and initial minimal-mild VF defect was stable or improved in 85%. In various types of CRAO there are significant differences in both initial and final VA and VF defects. In CRAO eyes seen within 7 days of onset and initial VA of counting fingers or worse, VA improved in 82% with transient non-arteritic CRAO, 67% with non-arteritic CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing, 22% with non-arteritic CRAO. Central VF improved in 39% of transient non-arteritic CRAO, 25% of non-arteritic CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing and 21% of non-arteritic CRAO. Peripheral VF improved in non-arteritic CRAO in 39% and in transient non-arteritic CRAO in 39%. In transient CRAO, finally peripheral VFs were normal in 93%. In non-arteritic CRAO eyes initially 22% had normal peripheral VF and in the rest it improved in 39%. Final VA of 20/40 or better was seen in 89% of permanent BRAO, and in 100% of transient BRAO and non-arteritic CLRAO. In permanent BRAO eyes, among those seen within 7 days of onset, central VF defect improved in 47% and peripheral VF in 52%, and in transient BRAO central and peripheral VFs were normal at follow-up. My studies showed that AION, CRVO, BRVO, CRAO and BRAO, each consist of multiple distinct clinical sub-categories with different visual outcome. Contrary to the prevalent impression, these studies on the natural history of visual outcome have shown that there is a statistically significant spontaneous visual improvement in each category. The factors which influence the visual outcome in various ocular vascular occlusive disorders are discussed."

DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: The study was performed at the Endocrinology Unit of the Second University of Naples. PATIENTS: Twenty-one HH patients with normal sense of smell (group 1), 10 patients with Kallmann's syndrome (group 2), 13 patients with HH associated with other pituitary hormone deficiencies (group 3), and 50 normal controls were studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: APA were evaluated in patients and in controls by indirect immunofluorescence. Moreover, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hypothalamic-pituitary region was performed in all three groups of patients. RESULTS: APA were detected at high titer in eight out of 21 patients in group 1 (38%) and in five of 13 in group 3 (38.4%), and at low titers in two out of 10 in group 2 (20%) and in three of 50 controls (6%). In patients of group 1, APA immunostained selectively gonadotropin-secreting cells, whereas in those of group 3, they immunostained other pituitary hormone-secreting cells also. None of patients in group 1 showed alterations on MRI, whereas all patients in group 2 showed aplasia/hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs/tracts and/or of olfactory sulci. Among the five APA-positive patients in group 3, three had normal MRI, one had findings of empty sella, and one had findings of autoimmune hypophysitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that some apparently idiopathic cases of HH, both isolated and associated with other pituitary impairment, can be caused by an early autoimmune process involving the gonadotrophs at pituitary level. Future longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the natural history of this process and the possible effect of early corticosteroid therapy."

Sperm induction protocols using gonadotrophins aim to replicate the natural endocrine control of spermatogenesis. Previously virilised men with adult-onset HH and normal testicular volume respond well to monotherapy in which human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) acts as a long-acting LH-analogue stimulating spermatogenesis. However, this approach is rarely successful for men with congenital HH (CHH) (eg, Kallmann syndrome), for whom combined gonadotrophin therapy (hCG + follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]) is an absolute requirement to maximise fertility potential. Key baseline predictors of successful spermatogenesis-induction include prior spontaneous testicular development (ie, testicular volume [TV] > 4 mL), serum inhibin B (IB ) concentration >60 pg/mL and no history of maldescended testes (cryptorchidism)."

OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to determine the natural history of reversal and to identify associated phenotypes and genotypes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS:This was a retrospective review of clinical, biochemical, and genetic features of patients with IHH evaluated at an academic medical center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:History of spontaneous fertility, regular menses, testicular growth, or normalization of serum sex steroids, LH secretory profiles, brain imaging findings, and sequences of 14 genes associated with IHH were reviewed. RESULTS:Of 308 patients with IHH, 44 underwent reversal. Time-to-event analysis estimated a lifetime incidence of reversal of 22%. There were no differences in the rates of cryptorchidism, micropenis, or partial pubertal development in patients with reversal vs IHH patients without reversal. Fifteen patients with reversal (30%) had Kallmann syndrome (IHH and anosmia); one had undetectable olfactory bulbs on a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Subjects with reversal were enriched for mutations affecting neurokinin B signaling compared with a cohort of IHH patients without reversal (10% vs 3%, P = .044), had comparable frequencies of mutations in FGFR1, PROKR2, and GNRHR, and had no mutations in KAL1. Five men did not sustain their reversal and again developed hypogonadotropism. CONCLUSIONS:Reversal of IHH may be more widespread than previously appreciated and occurs across a broad range of genotypes and phenotypes. Enrichment for mutations that disrupt neurokinin B signaling in patients who reversed indicates that, despite the importance of this signaling pathway for normal pubertal timing, its function is dispensable later in life. The occurrence of reversal in a patient with no olfactory bulbs demonstrates that these structures are not essential for normal reproductive function. Patients with IHH require lifelong monitoring for reversal and, if reversal occurs, subsequent relapse also may occur."

The aim of this study is to describe the clinical, biochemical, and histopathological findings in a group of Mexican HT1 patients and their outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Medical records of HT1 patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2011 were analyzed. The diagnosis of HT1 was confirmed by detection of succinylacetone in urine or blood. RESULTS:Sixteen nonrelated HT1 cases were analyzed. Mean age at clinical onset was 9 months, and the mean age at diagnosis was 16.3 months. Main clinical findings were hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, cirrhosis, liver failure, tubulopathy, nephromegaly, Fanconi syndrome, seizures and failure to thrive. Histopathological findings were cirrhosis, fibrosis and steatosis. The HT1 group had a mortality rate of 78%. Patients who received supportive care or nutritional treatment had a 3-year survival rate of 10%. For those who underwent liver transplantation, the 6-year survival rate was 60%. In most cases pharmacological treatment with nitisinone and special dietary products were not available. The leading causes of death were fulminant liver failure, metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, and porphyria-like neurologic crisis. Newborn screening programs in combination with the availability of orphan drugs, proper monitoring, genetic counseling, and clinical practice guidelines are needed to enable physicians to identify the disease, delay its progression, and improve patients' quality of life. CONCLUSION:The devastating natural history of HT1 is still observed in Mexican patients because they are not diagnosed and treated during the early stages of the disease."

It usually presents with liver failure but can be manifest as chronic liver disease. Rarely, it may present with nonhepatic manifestations such as renal dysfunction, porphyria-like illness or cardiomyopathy. There is a high lifetime risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Prior to the development of liver transplantation, most patients died in childhood.The clinical manifestations stem from the cytotoxicity of tyrosine metabolites accumulating proximal to the metabolic defect. Nitisinone acts on tyrosine metabolism upstream of the defect to prevent the production of these metabolites. Nitisinone is used in combination with a tyrosine- and phenylalanine-restricted diet. Nitisinone has transformed the natural history of tyrosinaemia. Liver failure is controlled in 90% of patients, those with chronic liver disease improve and nonhepatic manifestations are abolished. Nitisinone is well tolerated and has few adverse effects other than a predictable rise in plasma tyrosine levels. Nitisinone provides protection against HCC if it is started in infancy, but if commenced after the age of 2 years, a significant risk of HCC remains. Furthermore, where nitisinone is used pre-emptively, liver disease appears to be prevented, suggesting the importance of neonatal screening for tyrosinaemia where possible. Nitisinone is indicated for all children with HT-1, and liver transplantation is only indicated where nitisinone fails, or where the development of HCC is likely or suspected."

These macular or popular pigmented lesions are often of cosmetic concern to patients. In addition, their natural history of gradually increasing in size, thickness, and/or pigmentation often serves as the impetus compelling patients to present to a dermatologist for evaluation and skin cancer screening; SK is diagnosed and managed primarily by dermatologists. Data regarding SK prevalence and management from a survey of 594 practicing, board-certified dermatologists are summarized herein: Dermatologists report they diagnose an average of 155 patients per month with SK.

Cryosurgery is the most common removal method. Other commonly employed removal methods include shave excision, electrodessication, curettage or a combination of these. While these procedures can be used to remove SK lesions effectively, each has potential drawbacks and careful patient selection is required to optimize cosmetic results particularly in skin of color patients and patients with thick or numerous lesions.

Lymphomatoid papulosis (LP) is a chronic, recurrent, self-healing papulonodular skin eruption with the histopathologic features of a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma but an often benign and indolent clinical course (1). It is designated as a primary, cutaneous, CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder. The histopathologic features of LP are variable, with five main types (A-E) and several other variants (2). In most cases, LP presents with a generalized eruption of reddish-brown papules or nodules usually smaller than one cm on the trunk and limbs. Rarely, large, rapidly growing nodules may be the first manifestation of the disease (3). Patients with LP have an excellent prognosis even though they are at increased risk of developing secondary cutaneous or nodal lymphomas such as mycosis fungoides, primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL), or Hodgkin lymphoma (4). LP-associated lymphomas develop in between 10% and, as recently reported, 52% percent of patients and may occur before, concurrent with, or after the onset of LP (4,5). Our patient was diagnosed with ""conventional"" type An LP 14 years earlier based on the clinicopathologic correlation. The diagnosis was confirmed a year later after excision of a rapid growing ulcerated nodule on the forearm measuring 17 mm in diameter, which was clinically suspected to be anaplastic large cell lymphoma. During these 14 years, there were only a few worrisome recurrences of the disease, which resolved spontaneously or were successfully controlled with local steroids. During a recent exacerbation, when the third biopsy was performed, the patient presented with a large number of generalized reddish-brown pruritic papules and nodules on the trunk, extremities, neck, and face, predominantly up to one cm, some among which were necrotic and excoriated (Figure 1). There were three sites of clustered papules on the trunk, groin, and neck that resembled large, infiltrated plaques larger than two cm, at a glance mimicking cutaneous lymphoma (Figure 1, b, c). There were also older residual hyper- and hypopigmentations on the skin with prominent scarring. Excisional skin biopsy of one larger papule from the abdominal plaque was performed and was not morphologically or immunophenotypically different from the previous ones (Figure 2). Immunohistochemistry showed expression of CD 30 and the phenotypic markers of T-helper lymphocytes (CD 3+/-, CD4+) by neoplastic cells (Figure 2, c, d). Associated systemic malignant lymphoma was excluded based on examination findings, normal laboratory tests, the absence of palpably enlarged lymph nodes, hepatosplenomegaly, and systemic symptoms followed with MSCT. Serology for HIV and EBV was performed and was positive for EBV EBNA, VCA IgG, and IgM, which could be associated with the exacerbation of LP. Topical corticosteroids and phototherapy were administered when needed in this 14-year period, and methotrexate in a lower dose was prescribed during the extensive generalized eruptions. All of the applied therapeutic modalities led to a partial response. LP is a self-limiting disease for which many patients do not require specific treatment. Therapy should be directed at controlling symptoms in generalized eruptions or minimizing the frequency of recurrences, but none of the available treatment options disrupt the natural history of LP or reduce the risk of developing an associated lymphoma (6). Low-dose methotrexate is the initial therapy of choice in patients with the extensive or symptomatic disease or disease involving cosmetically sensitive areas like the face or hands, which were the affected areas in our patient (6,7). There are no markers that can help predict the course of the disease in a given patient, although some indicators have been suggested (8,9). Because of this lack of markers that can help predict the course of the disease and occurrence of malignant lymphoma, patients should remain in monitoring for the rest of their life."

Emergence of FPCL seems unrelated to feline leukemia virus (FeLV) serological positivity or to skin inflammation. A total of 17 cutaneous lymphomas with a history of vaccine injection at the site of tumor development were selected from 47 FPCLs. Clinical presentation, histology, immunophenotype, FeLV p27 and gp70 expression, and clonality were assessed. A majority of male (12/17), domestic short-haired (13/17) cats with a mean age of 11.3 years was reported. Postinjection time of development ranged from 15 days to approximately 9 years in 5 cats. At diagnosis, 11 of 17 cats had no evidence of internal disease. Lymphomas developed in interscapular (8/17), thoracic (8/17), and flank (1/17) cutaneous regions; lacked epitheliotropism; and were characterized by necrosis (16/17), angiocentricity (13/17), angioinvasion (9/17), angiodestruction (8/17), and peripheral inflammation composed of lymphoid aggregates (14/17). FeLV gp70 and/or p27 proteins were expressed in 10 of 17 tumors. By means of World Health Organization classification, immunophenotype, and clonality, the lesions were categorized as large B-cell lymphoma (11/17), anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (3/17), natural killer cell-like (1/17) lymphoma, or peripheral T-cell lymphoma (1/17). Lineage remained uncertain in 1 case. Cutaneous lymphomas at injection sites (CLIS) shared some clinical and pathological features with feline injection site sarcomas and with lymphomas developing in the setting of subacute to chronic inflammation reported in human beings. Persistent inflammation induced by the injection and by reactivation of FeLV expression may have contributed to emergence of CLIS."

Narcolepsy shares many features of rare disorders, in particular the lack of awareness of the disease with serious consequences for healthcare supply. Similar to other rare diseases, only a few European countries have registered narcolepsy cases in databases of the International Classification of Diseases or in registries of the European health authorities. A promising approach to identify disease-specific adverse health effects and needs in healthcare delivery in the field of rare diseases is to establish a distributed expert network. A first and important step is to create a database that allows collection, storage and dissemination of data on narcolepsy in a comprehensive and systematic way. Here, the first prospective web-based European narcolepsy database hosted by the European Narcolepsy Network is introduced. The database structure, standardization of data acquisition and quality control procedures are described, and an overview provided of the first 1079 patients from 18 European specialized centres.

Primary wake disorders],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9773032,"Primary wake disorders encompass various conditions of excessive daytime sleepiness and/or increased nighttime sleep, of unknown origin beginning most often in adolescence and of chronic or recurrent natural history. The best known of these conditions is narcolepsy associating two major clinical features, irresistible episodes of sleep, sleep onset REM periods and an almost constant association with HLA DR2-DQ1. The prevalence of the condition is close to the one of multiple sclerosis but positive diagnosis requires most often over 10 years to be made. The treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness has recently benefited from a new non-amphetamine awakening compound, modafinil, active in 60 to 70 p. 100 of the cases. The treatment of cataplexy still relies on antidepressants, tricyclics or selective serotonin reuptake blockers. Major advances in pathophysiology and pathogeny have been obtained through a natural model of the disease, canine narcolepsy. Pharmacological studies point to the importance of alpha-1 b adrenergic mechanisms in cataplexy, while dopaminergic systems seem more involved in excessive daytime sleepiness. As concerns genetics, the HLA DQB1*0602 gene predisposes to narcolepsy. In the canine model it is mirrored by an autosomal recessive gene showing a strong homology with the human immunoglobulin gene mu-switch. Familial studies have shown that besides typical phenotypes, attenuated forms of the condition characterized by isolated recurrent daytime naps and/or lapses into sleep do exist. In addition one or several other genes may be involved. Narcolepsy is multifactorial, including one or several genes as well as environmental factors. Idiopathic hypersomnia is noted for very long night sleep, difficulty waking up and more or less constant excessive daytime sleepiness. In contrast with narcolepsy sleep in not refreshing. There is no polysomnographic or immunogenetic special feature. Idiopathic hypersomnia is 10 times less frequent than narcolepsy. It is often overdiagnosed due to insufficient knowledge of other causes of excessive daytime sleepiness such as the upper airway resistance syndrome. Modafinil is also of great value in the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia. In the absence of an animal model, pathophysiology and pathogeny are still poorly understood. Even rarer is the Kleine-Levin syndrome which is easily distinguishable through its recurrent character and its tendency to progressively disappear. It mainly occurs in early adolescent males. Its main features are episodes of sleep of a week duration recurring at a several months' interval along with disturbances of alimentary and sexual behavior. There is no satisfactory treatment of hypersomniac episodes. On the other hand a prophylactic treatment with carbamazepine or lithium may be active. Pathophysiology remains unsettled in spite of some evidence of a hypothalamic functional disturbance."

There is a paucity of data published commenting on pediatric CVD exclusive of Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome (KTS) and post-thrombotic syndrome.This study aimed to define patterns of pediatric venous disease. All venous reflux studies performed on patients <18 years of age between January 2012 and June 2014 were reviewed. Study indication, patient history, clinical examination, and duplex ultrasound results were queried and described. Venous reflux parameters were compared using one-way analysis of variance.Twenty patients were evaluated. All presented through the vascular surgery or multidisciplinary venous clinic at a tertiary academic medical center. Indications for referral included swelling (n = 10), varicose veins (n = 9), and rubor/acrocyanosis (n = 3); two patients carried a diagnosis of KTS. Mean age at study was 13 years (range, 5-17 years). Clinical examination revealed the following: dependent rubor (n = 3); edema (n = 9); and varicose veins or venous abnormality concerning for venous malformation (n = 9). There were no stigmata of chronic inflammation, hyperpigmentation, or ulceration; 90% of patients (n = 18) demonstrated venous reflux by duplex ultrasound interrogation. Mean right great saphenous vein (GSV) diameter was 0.49 cm (range, 0.31-0.66 cm); mean left GSV diameter was 0.55 cm (range, 0.24-0.93 cm). Adjunctive studies were often used (including magnetic resonance venography and lymphoscintigraphy). Despite the presence of venous reflux on imaging, an alternate diagnosis was made in 8 of 18 children (44%), including postural orthostatic hypotension syndrome (n = 2), vascular malformation (n = 2), lymphedema (n = 2), complex regional pain syndrome (n = 1), and acrocyanosis of disuse (n = 1). An additional case of KTS was identified. Three cases referred for varicose veins were diagnosed with venous malformation. Maximum GSV diameter and venous reflux time were compared across patients with isolated CVD, KTS, or an alternate diagnosis (as before). Whereas there was no significant difference in maximum GSV diameter, superficial venous reflux time was significantly increased in the patients with primary CVD and KTS (P = .0394).The differential diagnosis for pediatric lower extremity edema and varicosities is broad; workup often requires adjunctive studies to secure the appropriate diagnosis. Often there is venous reflux present despite an alternative clinical diagnosis. Superficial venous reflux time may aid in the diagnosis of primary CVD. Whereas the clinical significance of pediatric venous reflux remains unclear, ongoing work to expand on venous parameters in healthy pediatric controls is warranted, as is additional follow-up to assess the natural history of pediatric venous disease."

Here, we report a fourth patient with asymmetric overgrowth due to a somatic PIK3CA mutation who had nephroblastomatosis or Wilms tumor. Similar to two of three reported patients with a somatic PIK3CA mutation and renal tumors, he shared a PIK3CA mutation affecting codon 1047, presented at birth with asymmetric overgrowth, and had fibroadipose overgrowth. Codon 1047 is most commonly affected by somatic mutations in PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS).

RESULTS:Of the 884 records found, 130 full text articles were reviewed, and 57 records were included. The median prevalence of elbow flexion contracture in BPBI was 48%. The magnitude of the contractures was between 5 and 90 degrees. Contractures > 30 degrees were found in 21% to 36% of children. With recent clinical and lab studies, there is stronger evidence that the contractures are largely due to the effects of denervation causing failure in the growth of the affected flexor muscles, while muscle imbalance, splint positioning, and postural preferences play a smaller role. CONCLUSION:The etiology of elbow flexion contractures is multifaceted.

Advances in surgical technique have resulted in the availability of safe, reliable options for treatment. Prevailing paradigms include, ""all neonatal brachial plexus palsy recovers,"" ""wait a year to see if recovery occurs,"" and ""don't move the arm."" Practicing by these principles places these patients at a disadvantage. Thus, the importance of this review is to provide an update on the management of NBPP to replace old beliefs with new paradigms. Observations:Changes within denervated muscle begin at the moment of injury, but without reinnervation become irreversible 18 to 24 months following denervation. These time-sensitive, irreversible changes are the scientific basis for the recommendations herein for the early management of NBPP and put into question the old paradigms. Early referral has become increasingly important because improved outcomes can be achieved using new management algorithms that allow surgery to be offered to patients unlikely to recover sufficiently with conservative management. Mounting evidence supports improved outcomes for appropriately selected patients with surgical management compared with natural history. Primary nerve surgery options now include nerve graft repair and nerve transfer. Specific indications continue to be elucidated, but both techniques offer a significant chance of restoration of function. Conclusions and Relevance:Mounting data support both the safety and effectiveness of surgery for patients with persistent NBPP. Despite this support, primary nerve surgery for NBPP continues to be underused. Surgery is but one part of the multidisciplinary care of NBPP. Early referral and implementation of multidisciplinary strategies give these children the best chance of functional recovery. Primary care physicians, nerve surgeons, physiatrists, and occupational and physical therapists must partner to continue to modify current treatment paradigms to provide improved quality care to neonates and children affected by NBPP."

Renal biopsies revealed thickening of glomerular basal membranes, mesangial matrix abnormalities, podocyte injury, focal segmental sclerosis, ischaemic changes and tubular abnormalities at various levels. Lipid vacuoles were visualized in electron microscopy images. CONCLUSIONS:CKD is conspicuously frequent in patients with lipodystrophy which has an early onset. Renal involvement appears multifactorial. While poorly controlled diabetes caused by severe insulin resistance may drive the disease in some cases, inherent underlying genetic defects may also lead to cell autonomous mechanisms contributory to the pathogenesis of kidney disease."

Prompt evaluation and diagnosis of these individuals not only facilitates more appropriate intervention but, together with identification of the underlying genetic defects, may provide valuable mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of rare as well as common, obesity-associated IR. Although diagnosis of these syndromes is complicated by the variability of their natural history, several presenting features are common to all severe IR syndromes including disturbed glucose metabolism (either hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia), acanthosis nigricans and severe ovarian dysfunction in lean individuals. These features may be evident at birth, or appear during childhood or adolescence, so their recognition by paediatricians is essential. Here we review the general and specific features of syndromes of severe IR, summarise their classification, and recommend strategies for their subsequent investigation."

The aim of the study is to describe the natural history of SPS, the extent of accumulated disability and the associated clinical and immunological features in patients followed for up to 8 years in a single center. METHODS:Our collective cohort included 57 SPS patients. Additionally, 32 of these patients were examined every 6 months for a two-year period in a longitudinal study protocol, to assess disease progression using quantitative measures of stiffness and heightened sensitivity. RESULTS:The most frequent initial symptom was leg stiffness, followed by paraspinal muscle rigidity and painful spasms in 95% of the patients. Although none of the patients required assistance for ambulation during the first 2 years of disease onset, 46 patients (80%) lost the ability to walk independently during our follow-up, despite symptomatic medications. In the longitudinal cohort, the number of stiff areas increased (p < 0.0001), consistent with worsening functional status and quality of life. High-titer anti-GAD antibodies were present in serum and CSF with elevated intrathecal GAD-specific IgG synthesis, but they did not correlate with clinical severity or progression. CONCLUSIONS:This large study on SPS patients, combining an eight-year follow-up at a single center by the same leading neurologist and his team, is the first to provide longitudinal data in a large patient subgroup using objective clinical measures. One of the main findings is that SPS is a progressive disease leading to physical disability over time."

In this case study, we used the eight-camera motion capture system for gait analysis (GA) to outline the gait features and track the clinical evolution of a young patient with SPS receiving a personalized multimodal therapy. GA was accurate in reflecting clinical changes over a 7-week-long period, thus representing a potential source for objective biomarkers in SPS. Therefore, future studies focusing on either the natural history or the treatment of SPS could adopt GA for reliable outocome measures, confirming this preliminary observation."

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions."

Clinical sites were selected over a wide geographic range within Latin America and the Caribbean, taking into account the dynamic course of the ZIKV epidemic. METHODS:Recruitment to the PW cohort will take place in antenatal care clinics. PW will be enrolled regardless of symptoms and followed over the course of pregnancy, approximately every 4 weeks. PW will be revisited at delivery (or after miscarriage/abortion) to assess birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities according to the evolving definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). After birth, children will be followed for 2 years in the CH cohort. Follow-up visits are scheduled at ages 1-3, 4-6, 12, and 24 months to assess neurocognitive and developmental milestones. In addition, a NH cohort for the characterization of symptomatic rash/fever illness was designed, including follow-up to capture persisting health problems. Blood, urine, and other biological materials will be collected, and tested for ZIKV and other relevant arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever) using RT-PCR or serological methods. A virtual, decentralized biobank will be created. Reciprocal clinical monitoring has been established between partner sites. Substudies of ZIKV seroprevalence, transmission clustering, disabilities and health economics, viral kinetics, the potential role of antibody enhancement, and co-infections will be linked to the cohort studies. DISCUSSION:Results of these large cohort studies will provide better risk estimates for birth defects and other developmental abnormalities associated with ZIKV infection including possible co-factors for the variability of risk estimates between other countries and regions. Additional outcomes include incidence and transmission estimates of ZIKV during and after pregnancy, characterization of short and long-term clinical course following infection and viral kinetics of ZIKV.

Three environmental MSSA and three environmental MRSA are selected for proteomic profiling using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation tandem mass spectrometry (iTRAQ MS/MS). Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotation are applied to interpret the functions of the proteins detected. 792 proteins are identified in MSSA and MRSA. Comparative analysis of MRSA and MSSA reveals that 8 of out 792 proteins are upregulated and 156 are downregulated. Proteins that have differences in abundance are predominantly involved in catalytic and binding activity. Among 164 differently abundant proteins, 29 are involved in pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, stress response, mismatch repair, and cell wall synthesis. Twenty-two proteins associated with pathogenicity including SPA, SBI, CLFA, and DLT are upregulated in MRSA. Moreover, the upregulated pathogenic protein ENTC2 in MSSA is determined to be a super antigen, potentially capable of triggering toxic shock syndrome in the host.

OBJECTIVE:To retrospectively study outcome of conservative treatment in patients with low output (<200 ml/day) EPF with DPDS following percutaneous or surgical intervention in acute necrotising pancreatitis (ANP). METHODS:The data of patients of low output EPF with DPDS treated conservatively in our unit over last 5 years was retrospectively analysed. Their clinical course, complications as well as time taken for fistula closure was retrieved. RESULTS:33 patients (27 males; mean age: 40.5 ± 9.3 years) of low output EPF and DPDS were studied. 31 patients developed EPF following percutaneous drainage (PCD) and 2 patients developed fistula following surgery. The drain fluid amylase ranged from 1600 to 32,000 IU/l and site of disruption was neck, proximal body and distal body in 4, 16 and 13 patients respectively. EPF closed spontaneously in all patients within 88.2 ± 63.46 days. PCD slipped out in 2 patients and led to formation of pseudocyst in 1 patient that was treated endoscopically.

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]"

We studied the pattern of MS closure on 3D-CT scans of 477 children admitted for head trauma since 2012. We also studied the prevalence of trigonocephaly and the sex ratio in our clinical series of patients with all types of synostosis diagnosed during the last 4 decades. In the majority of children, MS closure started at 4 months and was complete at 9 months. The prevalence of metopism was stable after 1 year of age, at 5.1%; it was more than twice as frequent in girls (F/M ratio 2.1, non-significant). Our trigonocephaly series and the literature show a steady increase in prevalence over recent decades. During the same period, the prevalence of metopism decreased steadily. Data from comparative anatomy and paleoanthropology suggest that postnatal MS persistence in our species results from the risk of dystocia caused by the closed pelvis associated with bipedalism. The increasing incidence of trigonocephaly appears to parallel the fall in prevalence of metopism. The increasing use of cesarean section may have eliminated a potent selection factor in favor of postnatal persistence of the MS."

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Measurements taken from CTs of non-operated children with Apert syndrome and age-matched controls were analysed using Centricity PACS system (from the lateral scout image) and the thick-sliced Osirix tool. CTs from non-operated children with Apert syndrome were used to investigate the natural history of their turricephaly both as a group and individually. RESULTS:There was statistically significant agreement between measurements taken from the CT scout and Osirix for 42 control children (R2 = 0.97) and 42 children with Apert syndrome (R2 = 0.98) and between two separate observers. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between CT scout-derived TI value between controls (1.73 ± 0.12, range 1.46-1.99) and Apert children (1.42 ± 0.15, range 1.13-1.73).

He showed single-mindedness and obsessive interests in the pursuit of science in his younger years and later he pursued with religion with the same determination. Pascal neglected social interactions; he was cold and aloof and had an obsessive revulsion to any expression of emotional attachment. As shown by his funerary mask and the autopsy report Pascal had craniosynostosis (primary nonsyndromic oxycephaly) with atrophy of the right half of the face. Congenital facial asymmetry due to craniosynostosis has a genetic basis. This suggests that Pascal's facial deformity may betray his propensity to suffer from genetically determined diseases including ASD. Despite the intrinsic limitations of a diagnosis based only on biographical information, we surmise that Pascal had the three key symptoms (obsessive interests, difficulty in social relationship and problems in communicating) that characterize ASD individuals."

The gold standard of therapy is the potassium channel blocker 3,4-diaminopyridine. To the best of our knowledge, no clinical reports have been published to date about long-term follow-up outcomes in patients who discontinued 3,4-diaminopyridine therapy. In addition, we know of no recent articles in which the natural history in patients with autoimmune-mediated Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome has been addressed. In this report, we describe the cases of two such patients.Patient 1 was a Caucasian man who had been diagnosed at age 15 years with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome with symptoms of fluctuating muscle weakness and easy fatigability. These symptoms stabilized, and his electrophysiological parameters normalized, during treatment with a maintenance dose of 50mg/day of 3,4-diaminopyridine. After 5.5 years, however, he wished to discontinue the treatment. After that point, his electrophysiological parameters and presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium-channel antibody titer remained stable. During the 15-year follow-up period, patient 1 reported mild exertion-induced complaints but did not feel restricted in his occupation and most daily activities. Patient 2 was a Caucasian man diagnosed at 32 years of age with a moderate limb girdle syndrome. He was treated with up to 80 mg/day of 3,4-diaminopyridine. Because of the drug's very short-lasting effect (<1 hour), however, he took it mostly irregularly (≤ 1 × 20 mg/day). During the 14- year period of observation, his repetitive nerve stimulation responses and presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium-channel antibody titer remained stable, his compound muscle action potential amplitudes were decreasing and his clinical symptoms did not deteriorate. At his last follow-up examination, patient 2 was independent in all of his daily activities.Some patients with autoimmune-mediated Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome show a stable clinical long-term course without treatment. The benefit of each long-term therapy should be critically assessed during follow-up, and possible side effects should be balanced against the quality of life in these patients."

We incidentally encountered electromyographic evidence of this syndrome in a patient being studied for another reason. The patient had controlled hypothyroidism and smoked for 9 pack-years but never had symptoms of weakness or had evidence of cancer. METHODS: Detailed electrophysiological and serological evaluations were undertaken in this study. RESULTS: Neuromuscular transmission tests were consistent with a presynaptic disorder. Autoantibodies specific for P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) were detected in the serum and persisted throughout 7 years of follow-up. Multiple IgG markers of thyrogastric autoimmunity also were detected. CONCLUSIONS: This demonstration of asymptomatic Lambert-Eaton syndrome persisting for 8 years provided novel insight into the natural history of the disorder. It is plausible that patients with a subclinical syndrome would have abrupt neuromuscular decompensation when challenged with medications that compromise the safety factor for synaptic transmission.

The analytic sample includes 448 children aged 8-10 years, 39% of whom were overweight or obese. MetS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation recommendations. Gingival inflammation was defined by the level of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and the extent of gingival bleeding. Sex-specific linear regression analyses estimated the associations between MetS and gingival inflammation, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Twenty-five children had MetS. Boys with MetS compared to those without, had a 49.5% (p-value = 0.001) higher GCF TNF-α level and 13.7% (p-value = 0.033) more sites with gingival bleeding. Moreover, for three of the five components of MetS - waist circumference, fasting plasma triglycerides, systolic blood pressure - an increase was associated with increased GCF TNF-α level in boys.

After neurology specialist training at Queen Square, he became the director of the Batten Unit, continuing his interest in respiratory physiology. There he began to work on myasthenia gravis in collaboration with Ricardo Miledi at University College London and in 1978, after performing the first studies on plasma exchange in that disease, he established a myasthenia gravis research group at the Royal Free Hospital. There he investigated the role of the thymus in this disease and demonstrated an autoimmune basis for the Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome and 'seronegative' myasthenia. He was awarded the first Medical Research Council Clinical Research Professorship in 1979 but moved to Oxford in 1987 when he was elected Action Research Professor of Neurology. While at Oxford, he continued to run a very successful multidisciplinary group, researched further into the thymic abnormalities and cellular immunology of myasthenia, identified antibody-mediated mechanisms in acquired neuromyotonia, and began the molecular work that identified the genetic basis for many forms of congenital myasthenic syndrome. Meanwhile, he was also involved in university and college governance and contributed widely to the Medical Research Council, government committees, research charities and the Association of British Neurologists. Among many honours, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1991, appointed Commander of the British Empire in 1996 and made a Foreign Associate Member of the Institute of Medicine of the United States in 2001. Nearing and following retirement from Oxford, where he continued to see patients with myasthenia, he was the President of the Association of British Neurologists and Editor of Brain, and led a National Institutes of Health-funded international trial of thymectomy."

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions."

Clinical sites were selected over a wide geographic range within Latin America and the Caribbean, taking into account the dynamic course of the ZIKV epidemic. METHODS:Recruitment to the PW cohort will take place in antenatal care clinics. PW will be enrolled regardless of symptoms and followed over the course of pregnancy, approximately every 4 weeks. PW will be revisited at delivery (or after miscarriage/abortion) to assess birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities according to the evolving definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). After birth, children will be followed for 2 years in the CH cohort. Follow-up visits are scheduled at ages 1-3, 4-6, 12, and 24 months to assess neurocognitive and developmental milestones. In addition, a NH cohort for the characterization of symptomatic rash/fever illness was designed, including follow-up to capture persisting health problems. Blood, urine, and other biological materials will be collected, and tested for ZIKV and other relevant arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever) using RT-PCR or serological methods. A virtual, decentralized biobank will be created. Reciprocal clinical monitoring has been established between partner sites. Substudies of ZIKV seroprevalence, transmission clustering, disabilities and health economics, viral kinetics, the potential role of antibody enhancement, and co-infections will be linked to the cohort studies. DISCUSSION:Results of these large cohort studies will provide better risk estimates for birth defects and other developmental abnormalities associated with ZIKV infection including possible co-factors for the variability of risk estimates between other countries and regions. Additional outcomes include incidence and transmission estimates of ZIKV during and after pregnancy, characterization of short and long-term clinical course following infection and viral kinetics of ZIKV.

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]"

Each parameter was assessed to obtain a total score. Patients were divided into five classes according to the anterior commissure (AC) visualization: class 0, complete AC visualization with large-bore laryngoscopes in the Boyce-Jackson position; class I, as class 0 with external laryngeal counterpressure; class II, as class I in the flexion-flexion position; class III, as class II using small-bore laryngoscopes; and class IV, impossible AC visualization. RESULTS: Class 0-I-II (good/acceptable laryngeal exposure) presented a median score < 6. This value was chosen as cutoff for distinguishing favorable versus difficult/impossible laryngeal exposures.

Problems related to the need to identify goblet cells to diagnose BE include the facts that goblet cells are uncommon in pediatric patients with BE, a small percentage of adults with columnar metaplasia of the esophagus do not contain goblet cells, the chances of detecting goblet cells are proportional to the length of columnar metaplasia, sampling error is common, and interpretation and differentiation of goblet cells vs. pseudogoblet cells may be difficult in some circumstances. In addition, goblet cells have been shown to wax and wane over the natural history of BE. Recent studies suggest that the background nongoblet epithelium in BE is biologically intestinalized, and shows a variety of molecular abnormalities similar to the goblet cell-containing epithelium. In addition, several retrospective and outcome studies suggest a well-defined risk of neoplasia in patients with esophageal columnar metaplasia, but without goblet cells. There are important clinical and economic implications to these findings and also with regard to the definition of BE. This review provides evidence to suggest that a diagnosis of BE should not require demonstration of goblet cells in mucosal biopsies, and offers considerable data to support the notion that a nongoblet epithelium is also at risk of malignancy.

Preexisting psychotic disorders (24.5%) and mood or anxiety disorders (31.1%) were common, as were early dystonia (19.4%) and a history of seizures (33.3%). CONCLUSIONS:Major clinical characteristics and response to standard treatments appear comparable in 22q11.2DS-associated PD to those in idiopathic PD, although the average age at onset is earlier. Importantly, treatment of preexisting psychotic illness may delay diagnosis of PD in 22q11.DS patients. An index of suspicion and vigilance for complex comorbidity may assist in identifying patients to prioritize for genetic testing."

Research up to now focuses on the management of the disease during childhood. The longer lifespan of these patients warrants deeper investigations of how and if aging could be affected by the syndrome. We decided to focus on the association of the disease with proliferative disorders. Data on proliferative disorders in a cohort of 321 patients from Italian and German Cri du Chat databases were collected. A neoplasia was present in four patients (age 10-50 yrs), and a fifth patient developed a cholesteatoma during childhood. It is of interest that two cases had an early onset of the neoplasia as compared to the expected age of development in the general population. The chromosome region deleted in 5p does not contain genes whose haploinsufficiency is a well-known main cause of the proliferative disorders observed. We nonetheless believe that reporting even sporadic cases of proliferative disorders in CdC patients may increase our knowledge as to the natural history of the disease. In conclusion, available information suggests that surveillance for cancer development in CdC can follow the guidelines for the general population."

In a prospective cohort study, 38 patients with the syndrome and 58 unaffected siblings were identified. Patients were studied in 1987 and again in 1993. Age of onset of blindness, hypertension, diabetes, renal impairment, and death was determined. The prevalence of obesity, gonadal dysfunction, and renal structural abnormalities was assessed. All but 5 BBS patients (86%) were legally blind, 26% being blind by the age of 13 years and 50% by 18 years. Eighty-eight percent were above the 90th percentile for height and weight. Twenty-five (66%) patients had hypertension, 25% of BBS patients by age 26 years, and 50% by age 34 years, whereas in the unaffected group, 25% had hypertension by age 49 years (P < 0.0001). Twelve (32%) BBS patients developed diabetes mellitus, compared with none of the unaffected group. Only 2 patients were insulin dependent. Twenty-five percent of BBS patients had diabetes by the age of 35 years. In 12 women of reproductive age, 1 (8%) had primary gonadal failure. In 10 men, 4 had primary testicular failure. Nine (25%) patients developed renal impairment, with 25% of the BBS group affected by the age of 48 years. Imaging procedures of the kidney were performed in 25 patients with normal renal function. Whereas fetal lobulation and calyceal cysts/diverticula/clubbing were characteristic, occurring in 96% of patients, 20% (n = 5) had diffuse and 4% (n = 1) focal cortical loss.

A greater knowledge of the genetics of inherited RCC has the potential to translate into novel therapeutic targets for sporadic RCC. METHODS:A literature review was performed summarising the current knowledge on hereditary RCC diagnosis, surveillance and management. RESULTS:Familial RCC is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although inherited RCC may present without a relevant family history. A number of familial RCC syndromes have been identified. Familial non-syndromic RCC is suspected when ≥ 2 relatives are affected in the absence of syndromic features, although clear diagnostic criteria are lacking. Young age at onset and bilateral/multicentric tumours are recognised characteristics which should prompt molecular genetic analysis. Surveillance in individuals at risk of inherited RCC aims to prevent morbidity and mortality via early detection of tumours. Though screening and management guidelines for some inherited RCC syndromes (e.g. von Hippel-Lindau disease, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis) are well defined for rare cause of inherited RCC (e.g. germline BAP1 mutations), there is limited information regarding the lifetime RCC risks and the most appropriate screening modalities.

Patients with Madelung deformity often report wrist deformity resulting from the prominence of the relatively long ulna. The typical Madelung deformity is associated with a Vickers ligament that creates a tether across the volar-ulnar radial physis that restricts growth across this segment. The distal radius deforms in the coronal (increasing radial inclination) and the sagittal (increasing volar tilt) planes. There is lunate subsidence and the proximal carpal row adapts to the deformity by forming an upside-down pyramid shape or triangle. Treatment depends on the age at presentation, degree of deformity, and magnitude of symptoms. Mild asymptomatic deformity warrants a period of nonsurgical management with serial x-ray examinations because the natural history is unpredictable. Many patients never require surgical intervention. Progressive deformity in the young child with considerable growth potential remaining requires release of Vickers ligament and radial physiolysis to prevent ongoing deterioration Concomitant ulnar epiphysiodesis may be necessary. Advanced asymptomatic deformity in older children with an unacceptable-appearing wrist or symptomatic deformity are indications for surgery. A dome osteotomy of the radius allows 3-dimensional correction of the deformity. Positive radiographic and clinical results after dome osteotomy have been reported."

The natural history of the disease following transplantation using a haploidentical (obligate heterozygous) living donor is still unclear, although previously described as favorable. We describe acute metabolic crises in a 20-month-old child with MSUD type II. The first well-documented one occurred 5 months after a successful liver transplantation from his mother. The patient developed encephalopathy with progressive lethargy and seizures after an episode of gastroenteritis with dehydration. Plasma levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine were markedly elevated and alloisoleucine was detected. He promptly responded to dialysis and BCAA-free dietetic management and subsequently could resume a normal diet. Since then he has had another symptomatic metabolic crisis with seizures. This case strongly suggests that some recipients of liver transplantation from a haploidentical parent possess limited capacity to oxidize BCAA at the time of catabolic stress and dehydration and remain at risk of severe metabolic crises. Thus, careful metabolic monitoring and prompt treatment post liver transplantation are still required to avoid neurological sequelae of MSUD, particularly if the donor is heterozygous for MSUD."

However, a very large expansion of covered metabolic disorders eluded Guthrie despite his best efforts. This required a new screening technology, tandem mass spectrometry, which was not available until recently. Now, almost all developed newborn screening program use tandem mass spectrometry to cover the 29 metabolic disorders recommended for coverage by the American College of Medical Genetics and additional secondary disorders. The results have in some cases been spectacular in preventing or greatly reducing the burden of disease imposed by many of the screened disorders. However, expanded newborn screening has also brought problems that need to be addressed. These include lack of knowledge about the natural history of some of the disorders, absence of effective preventive therapy for others, identification of seemingly benign disorders or benign variants of severe disorders, and the resulting parental anxiety. To address these and other issues brought by expanded newborn screening, a national effort led by the American College of Medical Genetics has been developed.

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33.

Neurological involvement results in severe disability and premature death, but understanding of the natural history of the disease remains limited. In this study, 32 caregivers of patients with MLD in the USA (16 with late-infantile MLD; 16 with juvenile MLD) were interviewed about their experiences of the disease. Qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts was performed to gain insights into symptom onset, the diagnostic process and disease progression, with a focus on the differences between late-infantile and juvenile MLD. RESULTS:The mean ages of patients at interview were 7.6 years and 20.7 years for individuals with late-infantile and juvenile MLD, respectively. Patients with late-infantile MLD had a mean age of 1.5 years at symptom onset and 2.6 years at diagnosis. The most common initial symptoms in this group related to problems with gross motor function (12/16 patients); 11 patients never learned to walk independently. For patients with juvenile MLD, the mean ages at symptom onset and diagnosis were 8.7 years and 11.6 years, respectively. Cognitive or social/behavioural problems were the most common first reported symptoms in this group (9/16 and 7/16 patients, respectively); these were generally followed by deterioration in motor function. The rate of functional decline was more rapid in patients with late-infantile MLD than those with juvenile MLD; the mean time from first symptom to first functional loss was 1 year versus 6.1 years, respectively. Nine patients with juvenile MLD and three with late-infantile MLD had undergone a haematopoietic stem cell transplant; outcomes following transplant were variable. CONCLUSIONS:Our data highlight clear overall differences in symptom profiles and disease progression between late-infantile and juvenile MLD, but also indicate some degree of interindividual variability within each subtype. These findings are broadly consistent with previously published descriptions of MLD and enhance our knowledge of the natural history of the disease, which ultimately should help to improve patient care and aid assessments of the effectiveness of disease-related interventions in the future."

When possible, parental interviews informed current neurologic status, quality-of-life, and adaptive functioning. Gross motor and expressive functions for late-infantile (LI-MLD) and juvenile (J-MLD) patients were described using previously reported, MLD-specific scales.Forty patients with confirmed MLD have undergone HSCT at our center. Twenty-one (53 %) survive at a median 12 years post-HSCT. Most deaths (n = 17) were treatment-related; two died from disease progression. Survival did not depend upon MLD subtype or symptom status at transplant. LI-MLD patients survive beyond reported life expectancy in untreated disease. Abnormal brain MRI and peripheral nerve conduction velocities (NCV) were common before HSCT. Following transplant, fewer patients experienced MRI progression compared to NCV deterioration. Sixteen LI-MLD and J-MLD survivors were evaluable for long-term gross motor and/or expressive language functioning using existing MLD clinical scoring systems. While most J-MLD patients regressed, the aggregate cohort demonstrated superior retention of function compared to published natural history. Seventeen LI-MLD, J-MLD and adult subtype (A-MLD) survivors were evaluable for long-term adaptive functioning, activities of daily living, and/or cognition. Relative cognitive sparing was observed despite overall global decline. Five sibling pairs (one LI-MLD and four J-MLD), in which at least one underwent transplant in our cohort, were evaluable. Within each familial dyad, survival or function was superior for the treated sibling, or if both siblings were transplanted, for the pre-symptomatic sibling.HSCT is a viable treatment option for MLD, but has significant limitations. Later-onset phenotypes may benefit most from early, pre-symptomatic transplant. Until superior, novel treatment strategies are demonstrated, MLD patients should be carefully considered for HSCT."

It is most commonly due to Alzheimer's disease pathology, while Lewy body disease, corticobasal degeneration, and prion disease are neuropathological entities that are less frequently associated with PCA. The diagnosis of PCA is often delayed, to the detriment of the patient, and awareness and understanding of PCA will improve detection, prognostication, and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS:The natural history of PCA appears to be distinct from typical Alzheimer's disease and significant heterogeneity exists within the PCA syndrome, with the underlying causes of this heterogeneity beginning to be explored. Functional and molecular imaging can assist in better understanding PCA, particularly assessment of network disruptions that contribute to clinical phenotypes. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are useful to detect underlying pathology, but measures of retinal thickness are less promising. There are currently no adequate treatment options for PCA. SUMMARY:Continued efforts to characterize PCA are needed, and greater awareness and understanding of atypical presentations of neurodegenerative dementias could serve to elucidate pathobiological mechanisms of underlying disease."

It is well recognized that these misfolded proteins are able to self-propagate and spread throughout the nervous system and cause neuronal injury in a way that resembles prion disease. These disease-specific misfolded proteins demonstrate unique features, including the seeding barrier, the conformational memory effect, strain selection and strain evolution, based on the presence of various strains. However, the accurate definition of the term strain remains to be clarified. Here, a clear interpretation is proposed by a retrospective of its history in prion research and the recent progress in neurodegeneration research. Furthermore, the causes contributing to the genesis of various strains are also summarized. Deeper insight into strains helps us to understand the phenomena we observe in this field and it also enlightens us on the elusive mechanisms and management of neurodegeneration."

However, rates of misdiagnosis are high, and little is known of its natural history and outcomes. Very few previous studies have been able to access routine clinical information for large, unbiased DLB cohorts in order to establish initial presentation, neuropsychological profile, and mortality. OBJECTIVE:To examine in detail, symptom patterns at presentation and their association with outcomes, including mortality, in a large naturalistic DLB cohort from a secondary care sample. METHODS:A retrospective cohort design was used to identify a DLB cohort (n = 251) from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT). Information relating to first consultation, diagnosis, and DLB diagnostic features were extracted. RESULTS:A wide range of presenting complaints and differential initial diagnoses were identified for the cohort. Along with memory loss (27.1%) and hallucinations (25.4%), low mood (25.1%) was noted as a key presenting complaint among the DLB cohort. Rates of REM sleep disorder were considerably lower (8.4%) than would be expected. Deficits in non-amnestic cognitive domains were associated with reduced mortality compared with amnestic-only presentations. CONCLUSION:Individuals later diagnosed with DLB present initially to secondary care with a wide range of symptoms and complaints, some of which are not immediately suggestive of a DLB diagnosis. More examinations of large cohorts such as this are needed to further elucidate the complex presentation and clinical course of DLB, and to confirm whether amnestic-only presentation confers a worse outcome."

DESIGN:Twenty-question online survey administered through the Lewy Body Dementia Association. SETTING:United States. PARTICIPANTS:Caregivers, family, and friends of individuals who died in the past 5 years with a diagnosis of DLB (survey respondents: n = 658, 89% female, median age 50-69). MEASUREMENTS:The survey included 3 questions about the respondent's background and 17 about the end-of-life experiences of the person with DLB. Topics included time from symptom onset and diagnosis to death, cause of death, advance directive completion, end-of-life education, hospice use, and location of death. Results were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS:Most individuals with DLB died within 5 years of diagnosis (median 3-4 years). Respondents indicated that physicians rarely discussed what to expect at the end of life (40% total, but only 22% to a helpful degree) and that the caregiver usually initiated such conversations. Death was usually expected, but fewer than half of respondents felt prepared for what to expect. Seventy-eight percent used hospice, usually at home or in skilled care, with wide variations in duration. Failure to thrive was the most common cause of death (65%), followed by pneumonia and swallowing difficulties (23%), other medical conditions (19%), and complications from falling (10%) (multiple causes allowed). CONCLUSION:Study results highlight a critical need for better prognostic counseling and education for persons and families living with DLB. The results of the current study can inform such counseling, but additional studies are needed to further explore expected prognosis of individuals diagnosed clinically with DLB and optimal use of palliative care services.

Placebo effects and responses can produce a beneficial effect that cannot be attributed to the properties of the intervention itself, since it is usually inactive, and should, therefore, be due to the patient's expectations about treatment (placebo effects), or confounding factors such as natural history, co-interventions, biases, among other co-factors (placebo responses). However, adverse events (AEs) may occur when using a placebo intervention, a phenomenon that is called nocebo. Like placebo, the nocebo effect is a cognitive and idiosyncratic phenomenon with specific biological bases, controlled by distinctive neurotransmitters within mapped brain areas most likely located within the network of the limbic system. Nocebo responses has been found to be very prevalent in various neurological conditions, in particular, in many brain disorders including headache, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and motor neuron disease. Pooled AE rates in the placebo groups (nocebo AE rates) vary from 25% in the symptomatic treatment for multiple sclerosis RCTs to almost 80% in motor neuron disease RCTs. Pooled dropout rates because of AEs in the placebo groups (i.e., nocebo dropout rates) vary from 2% in multiple sclerosis RCTs to almost 10% in PD RCTs. Across all brain disorders, the nature of AEs reported in the placebo-treated subjects mirrors those reported by active drug-treated subjects, suggesting that awareness of drug side-effect profiles might have influenced patient expectations and, thus, nocebo responses. Unexplored brain diseases where nocebo should be studied further include mental disorders (i.e., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), vascular disorders (i.e., acute ischemic stroke, vascular dementia), degenerative disorders (i.e., frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia) and other systemic atrophies of the brain (i.e., hereditary ataxias)."

OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine possible causal associations and review the clinical features, natural history, and response to treatment of patients with FFA attending a specialist hair clinic. METHODS: This was a case note review of 60 patients with FFA. RESULTS: The number of patients with FFA seen has increased over the last decade. All were Caucasian women, with significantly above-average affluence scores and were less likely to be smokers. The mean age at presentation was 64 years and average disease duration was 3.4 years (range: 6 months-30 years). Three patients were premenopausal. All patients had frontotemporal involvement, with follicular hyperkeratosis, scarring, and variable perifollicular erythema. Several patients had more unusual patterns: 8 had extensive parietal involvement, 4 had occipital involvement, 1 had asymmetric frontal involvement, and 5 had typical FFA associated with diffuse scalp lichen planopilaris. Eyebrow loss was documented in 73%, eyelash loss in 3%, and body hair loss in 25%. Almost all patients had been treated with superpotent topical steroids.

Dermoscopy can be very useful, as the differential diagnosis between traction alopecia, alopecia areata, FFA and cicatricial marginal alopecia may be difficult. It is not clear whether or not treatment alters the natural history of the disease - the disease stabilized with time in most of the patients with or without continuing treatment.

RESULTS:Eighty-seven patients with LP were examined during a 12.5-year period of observation. These patients formed 2.5% of the total number of pediatric dermatology patients and 0.6% of the total number of new dermatology outpatients. The male : female ratio was 1.1 : 1. The age at onset was between 8 months and 12 years (mean, 7.1 years). Classical LP was observed in 53 (60.9%) patients, followed by actinic LP in 10 (11.5%), and lichen planus hypertrophicus (LPH) and linear LP in eight (9.2%) each. Other forms seen were eruptive, follicular, lichen planopilaris, atrophic, and bullous LP. The involvement of skin alone was observed in 75 (86.2%) children and mucosa alone only in one (1.1%) child. Concomitant skin and mucosal involvement was seen at the time of presentation in four patients, while mucosal involvement occurred later during the course of the disease in seven patients. Lesions appeared earlier in boys than in girls. CONCLUSIONS:The natural history of LP in children was essentially similar to that in adults. Unusual features, such as involvement of the palms and soles and upper eyelids, were observed. Actinic LP, mimicking melasma, as reported in adult women, also seems to occur in children."

The etiology is unknown, but likely heterogeneous. While postnatal identification of its associated gastrointestinal, spinal, and genitourinary systems delineates the extent and natural history of OEIS complex, prenatal findings may provide additional information regarding early detection, possible causative factors, and outcome. The purposes of this study were to: (1) present the prenatal ascertainment of OEIS complex in this series of 15 cases identified through several different sources compared to the literature, and (2) discuss the relationship of these prenatal findings to possible abnormal developmental mechanisms causing OEIS complex. These 15 cases indicate that OEIS complex may be difficult to diagnose prenatally, and that the full extent of abnormalities may not be clear until postnatal exam. Confusion with limb-body wall complex (two of our cases) and pentalogy of Cantrell (one of our cases) can occur. Anal/gastrointestinal malformations and genital ambiguity are under-ascertained. Conversely, prenatal defects may resolve postnatally, yet may provide clues for pathogenetic mechanisms. For instance, the finding of nuchal thickening in our three cases (one reported) suggests vascular/hemodynamic compromise early in embryologic development, or intrathoracic compression leading to jugular lymphatic obstruction may play a role. The association of twinning and OEIS complex suggests they may occur as early as blastogenesis. Our three sets of discordant twins also suggest a non-genetic etiology for OEIS complex of uteroplacental insufficiency. This study also indicates that OEIS complex may be more common than previously thought."

The Y111C-KCNQ1 mutation causes a severe phenotype in vitro, suggesting a high-risk mutation. This study investigated the phenotype among Y111C-KCNQ1 mutation carriers in the Swedish population with a focus on life-threatening cardiac events. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 80 mutation carriers in 15 index families, segregating the Y111C-KCNQ1 mutation during a national inventory of mutations causing the long-QT syndrome. Twenty-four mutation carriers <40 years experienced syncope (30%). One mutation carrier had an aborted cardiac arrest (1.25%). No case of sudden cardiac death was reported during a mean nonmedicated follow-up of 25+/-20 years. This corresponds to a low incidence rate of life-threatening cardiac events (0.05%/year versus 0.3%/year, P=0.025). In 8 Y111C families connected by a common ancestor, the natural history of the mutation was assessed by investigating the survival over the age of 40 years for 107 nonmedicated ascertained mutation carriers (n=24) and family members (n=83) born between 1873 and 1968. In total, 4 deaths in individuals younger than 40 years were noted: 1 case of noncardiac death and 3 infant deaths between 1873 and 1915. CONCLUSIONS: The dominant-negative Y111C-KCNQ1 mutation, associated with a severe phenotype in vitro, presents with a low incidence of life-threatening cardiac events in a Swedish population.

We investigated growth, renal function, and serum chemistry values in patients with the oculocerebrorenal syndrome to determine the natural history of the disorder and its heterogeneity with respect to these characteristics. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with the oculocerebrorenal syndrome, ranging in age from 4 months to 31 years, were examined. Height was compared with bone age. Renal function was assessed by measurements of proteinuria, urinary volume, and fractional excretions of potassium, phosphate, carnitine, and amino acids. Creatinine clearance was determined as a measure of glomerular function. RESULTS: In the oculocerebrorenal syndrome, linear growth decreases after one year of age; bone age lies between chronologic age and height age. Renal dysfunction occurs in the first year of life, characterized by proteinuria (mean [+/- SD], 1.38 +/- 0.77 g of urinary protein per square meter of body-surface area per day; normal, less than or equal to 0.10), generalized aminoaciduria (mean, 686 +/- 505 mumol of urinary amino acid per kilogram of body weight per day; normal, 94 +/- 45), carnitine wasting (mean fractional excretion, 0.10 +/- 0.05; normal, 0.03 +/- 0.01), and phosphaturia progressing into the third decade. Urinary wasting of individual amino acids is milder than in cystinosis, and branched-chain amino acids are relatively spared. Reciprocal serum creatinine levels fall linearly with age, predicting renal failure in the fourth decade. Concentrations of the muscle enzymes creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as of total serum protein, serum alpha 2-globulin, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are elevated. CONCLUSIONS: Renal glomerular deterioration is slowly progressive in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome. Renal tubular dysfunction begins early and persists; most patients require alkalinization therapy, and many benefit from supplemental potassium, phosphate, calcium, or carnitine. Serum enzyme elevations suggest muscle involvement in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome."

The system was built to be used through the internet, ensuring a secure environment, respecting privacy for participants, and acting automated to allow for low costs and limiting human mistakes in data handling. Recruitment of participants is through the patient support groups. In addition, as a sub-study, we used the data from the waihonapedia system to compare the two proposed diagnostic classification systems for PTHS. RESULTS:We present here the results of the initial, cross-sectional questionnaire in which early development, physical health, cognition and behaviour are interrogated, and to which modules specific for PTHS were added on epilepsy and breathing patterns. We describe 101 individuals with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of PTHS. Comparison of the two classification systems aimed at helping the clinical diagnosis was performed in 47 of the present PTHS individuals, with disappointing results for both. Internationally accepted clinical diagnostic criteria are needed. CONCLUSION:The present cross-sectional data on the natural history of PTHS have yielded useful information which will further increase when follow-up data will be added. No doubt this will improve both care and research."

We performed a collaborative international study to delineate phenotype, natural history, variability, and genotype-phenotype correlations in more detail. We gathered information on 103 cytogenetically or molecularly confirmed affected individuals. TRPS I was present in 85 individuals (22 missense mutations, 62 other mutations), TRPS II in 14, and in 5 it remained uncertain whether TRPS1 was partially or completely deleted. Main features defining the facial phenotype include fine and sparse hair, thick and broad eyebrows, especially the medial portion, a broad nasal ridge and tip, underdeveloped nasal alae, and a broad columella. The facial manifestations in patients with TRPS I and TRPS II do not show a significant difference. In the limbs the main findings are short hands and feet, hypermobility, and a tendency for isolated metacarpals and metatarsals to be shortened. Nails of fingers and toes are typically thin and dystrophic. The radiological hallmark are the cone-shaped epiphyses and in TRPS II multiple exostoses. Osteopenia is common in both, as is reduced linear growth, both prenatally and postnatally. Variability for all findings, also within a single family, can be marked. Morbidity mostly concerns joint problems, manifesting in increased or decreased mobility, pain and in a minority an increased fracture rate. The hips can be markedly affected at a (very) young age. Intellectual disability is uncommon in TRPS I and, if present, usually mild. In TRPS II intellectual disability is present in most but not all, and again typically mild to moderate in severity. Missense mutations are located exclusively in exon 6 and 7 of TRPS1. Other mutations are located anywhere in exons 4-7. Whole gene deletions are common but have variable breakpoints. Most of the phenotype in patients with TRPS II is explained by the deletion of TRPS1 and EXT1, but haploinsufficiency of RAD21 is also likely to contribute. Genotype-phenotype studies showed that mutations located in exon 6 may have somewhat more pronounced facial characteristics and more marked shortening of hands and feet compared to mutations located elsewhere in TRPS1, but numbers are too small to allow firm conclusions."

The majority of breakpoints lie within segmental duplication (SD) blocks. Low sequence identity and large intervals of unique sequence between SD blocks likely contribute to the rarity of 15q24 deletions, which occur 8-10 times less frequently than 1q21 or 15q13 microdeletions in our series. Two small, atypical deletions were identified within the region that help delineate the critical region for the core phenotype in the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome.The molecular characterisation of these patients suggests that the core cognitive features of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, including developmental delays and severe speech problems, are largely due to deletion of genes in a 1.1-Mb critical region. However, genes just distal to the critical region also play an important role in cognition and in the development of characteristic facial features associated with 15q24 deletions. Clearly, deletions in the 15q24 region are variable in size and extent. Knowledge of the breakpoints and size of deletion combined with the natural history and medical problems of our patients provide insights that will inform management guidelines. Based on common phenotypic features, all patients with 15q24 microdeletions should receive a thorough neurodevelopmental evaluation, physical, occupational and speech therapies, and regular audiologic and ophthalmologic screening."

A National Institutes of Health LAM Registry was established to define the natural history and identify prognostic biomarkers that can help guide management and decision-making in patients with LAM. METHODS:A linear mixed effects model was used to compute the rate of decline of FEV1 and to identify variables affecting FEV1 decline among 217 registry patients who enrolled from 1998 to 2001. Prognostic variables associated with progression to death/lung transplantation were identified by using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS:Mean annual decline of FEV1 was 89 ± 53 mL/year and remained remarkably constant regardless of baseline lung function. FEV1 decline was more rapid in those with greater cyst profusion on CT scanning (P = .02) and in premenopausal subjects (118 mL/year) compared with postmenopausal subjects (74 mL/year) (P = .003). There were 26 deaths and 43 lung transplantations during the evaluation period. The estimated 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year transplant-free survival rates were 94%, 85%, 75%, and 64%, respectively.

METHODS: Demographic data, clinical features, lung function and tumour size were obtained from clinical records of patients attending the National Centre for LAM in Nottingham, UK. RESULTS: 122 patients with definite or probable LAM by European Respiratory Society criteria were identified. One hundred and seven had sporadic LAM, of which 53 (50%) had at least one angiomyolipoma. In patients with sporadic LAM presentation of angiomyolipoma preceded or followed onset of lung symptoms by up to 11 and 38 years respectively. Mean tumour size was 28 mm (range 5-140 mm) at presentation and growth was 1.8 mm/yr (95% C.I. 0.42-3.82) thereafter. Eleven patients with sporadic LAM had had a nephrectomy due to angiomyolipoma bleeding. The need for intervention did not differ between those with TSC-LAM and sporadic LAM. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LAM have a high prevalence of symptomatic angiomyolipoma which can present at any time. Angiomyolipoma in sporadic-LAM have a similar risk of bleeding to those with TSC.

In 2007, the most recently published checklist of Iranian mosquitoes included 64 species representing seven genera. Public databases were searched to the end of August 2018 for publications concerning the diseases in Iran caused by mosquito-borne pathogens. Pertinent information was extracted and analyzed, and the checklist of Iranian mosquitoes was updated. Six arboviral diseases, two bacterial diseases, four helminthic diseases and two protozoal diseases occur in Iran. The agents of these diseases are biologically or mechanically known or assumed to be transmitted by mosquitoes. The updated checklist of Iranian mosquitoes includes 69 species representing seven or 11 genera depending on the generic classification of aedines. There is no published information about the role of mosquitoes in the transmission of the causal agents of avian malaria, avian pox, bovine ephemeral fever, dengue fever, Rift Valley fever, Sindbis fever, Deraiophoronema evansi infection, lymphatic filariasis, anthrax and tularemia in Iran. There is just one imported case of lymphatic filariasis, which is not endemic in the country. It seems arthropods do not play an important role in the epidemiology of anthrax and ixodid ticks are the main vectors of the tularemia bacterium. In view of the recent finding of only a few adults and larvae of Aedes albopictus in southeastern Iran and the absence of Ae. aegypti, it is not possible to infer the indigenous transmission of the dengue fever virus in Iran.

In Burkina Faso larviciding had been phased out by 1989 when it was considered that onchocerciasis had been reduced to levels below the transmission breakpoint (and any residual infections would disappear without further intervention). There was never any mass drug administration against onchocerciasis in Burkina Faso, except in the Bougouriba and Comoé river basins (from 1996 and 2011 to present respectively) because in each of these two areas there was a resurgence of infection, and in parts of the Nakambé River basin and Sissili River basin from 1992 to 1998. However, mass drug administration with ivermectin was also phased in across the whole country starting in 2000 using ivermectin against lymphatic filariasis and is currently being phased out (depending upon the epidemiological parameters). In this publication we report a new epidemiological survey for onchocerciasis which was carried out in 2014 in the Upper Mouhoun, Nakambé and Nazinon river basins in Burkina Faso to evaluate the prevalence and intensity of infection of onchocerciasis. A total of 11,195 people from 61 villages were examined across these three river basins, and onchocerciasis prevalence by skin-snip was below 5% in all villages, below 1% in 57 villages (93% of 61 villages) and zero in 47. In the 14 villages with positive skin snips, prevalence figures ranged from 0.31% to 3.50%. During the survey 31 infected individuals were found. All of them were Burkinabé, of whom 30 had a recent history of residence in Côte d'Ivoire (with a range of 0.5 to 73 microfilariae per skin-snip from two snips per person) and only one had no history of migration and presumably had an autochthonous infection (mean of 0.5 microfilariae per skin snip from two snips). According to parasitological indicators listed by the World Health Organization African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control in 2010, the situation for onchocerciasis was considered to be satisfactory in all three river basins and probably below the transmission threshold, in which case the disease should disappear naturally without the need for further intervention in the absence of continuing immigration. However, the results clearly indicate that infected persons coming from endemic zones of Côte d'Ivoire are settling in small communities which are otherwise nearly free from onchocerciasis in Burkina Faso. They are thus a source of continuing re-introduction of the parasite into the basins and could be a risk for the achievement of onchocerciasis elimination in all three basins. This would justify the continuation of periodic epidemiological surveys to monitor the possible recrudescence of the disease, and entomological (vector) surveys should be undertaken to assess and monitor the residual transmission."

It is estimated that almost 2 billion people worldwide are infected with helminths. Whilst the WHO treatment guidelines for helminth infections are mostly aimed at controlling morbidity, there has been a recent shift with some countries moving towards goals of disease elimination through mass drug administration, especially for LF and onchocerciasis. However, as prevalence is driven lower, treating entire populations may no longer be the most efficient or cost-effective strategy. Instead, it may be beneficial to identify individuals or demographic groups who are persistently infected, often termed as being ""predisposed"" to infection, and target treatment at them. METHODS:The authors searched Embase, MEDLINE, Global Health, and Web of Science for all English language, human-based papers investigating predisposition to helminth infections published up to October 31st, 2017. The varying definitions used to describe predisposition, and the statistical tests used to determine its presence, are summarised. Evidence for predisposition is presented, stratified by helminth species, and risk factors for predisposition to infection are identified and discussed. RESULTS:In total, 43 papers were identified, summarising results from 34 different studies in 23 countries. Consistent evidence of predisposition to infection with certain species of human helminth was identified. Children were regularly found to experience greater predisposition to Ascaris lumbricoides, Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium than adults. Females were found to be more predisposed to A. lumbricoides infection than were males. Household clustering of infection was identified for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and S. japonicum. Ascaris lumbricoides and T. trichiura also showed evidence of familial predisposition. Whilst strong evidence for predisposition to hookworm infection was identified, findings with regards to which groups were affected were considerably more varied than for other helminth species. CONCLUSION:This review has found consistent evidence of predisposition to heavy (and light) infection for certain human helminth species. However, further research is needed to identify reasons for the reported differences between demographic groups. Molecular epidemiological methods associated with whole genome sequencing to determine 'who infects whom' may shed more light on the factors generating predisposition."

Recently, attention and funding has turned towards the question whether MDA alone can result in the interruption of transmission for STH. The lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination programme, have been successful in reaching whole communities. There is the possibility of building upon the infrastructure created for these LF-programmes to enhance the control of STH. Using hookworm as an example, we explore what further MDA coverage might be required to induce interruption of transmission for hookworm in the wake of a successful LF programme. RESULTS:Analyses based on the model of STH transmission and MDA impact predict the effects of previous LF control by MDA over five years, on a defined baseline prevalence of STH in an area with a defined transmission intensity (the basic reproductive number R0). If the LF MDA programme achieved a high coverage (70, 70 and 60% for pre-SAC, SAC and adults, respectively) we expect that in communities with a hookworm prevalence of 15%, after 5 years of LF control, the intrinsic R0 value in that setting is 2.47. By contrast, if lower LF coverages were achieved (40, 40 and 30% for pre-SAC, SAC and adults, respectively), with the same prevalence of 15% at baseline (after 5 years of LF MDA), the intrinsic hookworm R0 value is predicted to be 1.67. The intrinsic R0 value has a large effect on the expected successes of follow-up STH programmes post LF MDA. Consequently, the outcomes of identical programmes may differ between these communities. CONCLUSION:To design the optimal MDA intervention to eliminate STH infections, it is vital to have information on historical MDA programmes and baseline prevalence to estimate the intrinsic transmission intensity for the defined setting (R0). The baseline prevalence alone is not sufficient to inform policy for the control of STH, post cessation of LF MDA, since this will be highly dependent on the intensity and effectiveness of past programmes and the intrinsic transmission intensity of the dominant STH species in any given setting."

We included soil samples that had been previously characterized, in addition we present other data describing the characteristics of the soil and include pure phase mineral standards as comparisons.The bulk chemical composition of the soils were statistically significantly different between the podoconiosis-endemic and non-endemic areas, with the exception of CaO and Cr. Likewise, the soil mineralogy was statistically significant for iron oxide, feldspars, mica and chlorite. Smectite and kaolinite clays were widely present and elicited a strong HA, as did quartz, in comparison to other mineral phases tested, although no strong difference was found in HA between soils from the two areas. The relationship was further investigated with principle component analysis (PCA), which showed that a combination of an increase in Y, Zr and Al2O3, and a concurrent increase Fe2O3, TiO2, MnO and Ba in the soils increased HA.The mineralogy and chemistry of the soils influenced the HA, although the interplay between the components is complex. Further research should consider the variable biopersistance, hygroscopicity and hardness of the minerals and further characterize the nano-scale particles."

In the clinical context of cancer, the pathogenesis of lymphoedema ensues most typically from the modalities employed to stage and treat the cancer (in particular, surgery and radiotherapy). Despite advances in cancer treatment, lifelong lymphoedema (limb swelling and the accompanying chronic inflammatory processes) affects approximately one in seven individuals treated for cancer, although estimates of lymphoedema prevalence following cancer treatment vary widely depending upon the diagnostic criteria used and the duration of follow-up. The natural history of cancer-associated lymphoedema is defined by increasing limb girth, fibrosis, inflammation, abnormal fat deposition and eventual marked cutaneous pathology, which also increases the risk of recurrent skin infections. Lymphoedema can substantially affect the daily quality of life of patients, as, in addition to aesthetic concerns, it can cause discomfort and affect the ability to carry out daily tasks. Clinical diagnosis is dependent on comparison of the affected region with the equivalent region on the unaffected side and, if available, with pre-surgical measurements. Surveillance is indicated in this high-risk population to facilitate disease detection at the early stages, when therapeutic interventions are most effective.

Objective:The objectives were to determine the prevalence and natural history of AWS and the association between AWS and function, range of motion, pain, lymphedema, and body mass index (BMI). Design:This study was a longitudinal prospective cohort study utilizing a repeated measures design. Methods:Axillary web syndrome, function, shoulder range of motion, pain, and lymphedema (using circumference, bioimpedance spectroscopy, tissue dielectric constant) were assessed in women at 2, 4, and 12 weeks and 18 months following breast cancer surgery. Prevalence of AWS and the association with the measured outcomes were analyzed. Results:Thirty-six women agreed to participate in the study. The cumulative prevalence of AWS was 50% (18/36) at 18 months following breast cancer surgery. AWS was identified as a risk factor for reduced function. Women with AWS had statistically reduced range of motion, lower BMI, and higher number of lymph nodes removed compared to the non-AWS group. Forty-one percent (13/32) of women had AWS at 18 months. AWS reoccurred in 6 women following resolution, and a new case developed beyond the early postoperative period. The overall prevalence of physical impairments ranged from 66% to 97% within the first 18 months following surgery regardless of AWS. Limitations:Limitations include a small sample size and potential treatment effect. Conclusion:AWS occurs in approximately 50% of women following breast cancer surgery. It can persist for 18 months and potentially longer, develop beyond the early postoperative time period, and reoccur after resolution. Clinicians need to be aware of the chronicity of AWS and its association with reduced range of motion and function."

Recently, attention and funding has turned towards the question whether MDA alone can result in the interruption of transmission for STH. The lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination programme, have been successful in reaching whole communities. There is the possibility of building upon the infrastructure created for these LF-programmes to enhance the control of STH. Using hookworm as an example, we explore what further MDA coverage might be required to induce interruption of transmission for hookworm in the wake of a successful LF programme. RESULTS:Analyses based on the model of STH transmission and MDA impact predict the effects of previous LF control by MDA over five years, on a defined baseline prevalence of STH in an area with a defined transmission intensity (the basic reproductive number R0). If the LF MDA programme achieved a high coverage (70, 70 and 60% for pre-SAC, SAC and adults, respectively) we expect that in communities with a hookworm prevalence of 15%, after 5 years of LF control, the intrinsic R0 value in that setting is 2.47. By contrast, if lower LF coverages were achieved (40, 40 and 30% for pre-SAC, SAC and adults, respectively), with the same prevalence of 15% at baseline (after 5 years of LF MDA), the intrinsic hookworm R0 value is predicted to be 1.67. The intrinsic R0 value has a large effect on the expected successes of follow-up STH programmes post LF MDA. Consequently, the outcomes of identical programmes may differ between these communities. CONCLUSION:To design the optimal MDA intervention to eliminate STH infections, it is vital to have information on historical MDA programmes and baseline prevalence to estimate the intrinsic transmission intensity for the defined setting (R0). The baseline prevalence alone is not sufficient to inform policy for the control of STH, post cessation of LF MDA, since this will be highly dependent on the intensity and effectiveness of past programmes and the intrinsic transmission intensity of the dominant STH species in any given setting."

It is thought that soil particles can pass through the soles of the feet and taken up by the lymphatic system, leading to the characteristic chronic oedema of the lower legs that becomes disfiguring and disabling over time.The close association of the disease with volcanic soils led us to investigate the characteristics of soil samples in an endemic area in Ethiopia to identify the potential causal constituents. We used the in vitro haemolysis assay and compared haemolytic activity (HA) with soil samples collected in a non-endemic region of the same area in Ethiopia. We included soil samples that had been previously characterized, in addition we present other data describing the characteristics of the soil and include pure phase mineral standards as comparisons.The bulk chemical composition of the soils were statistically significantly different between the podoconiosis-endemic and non-endemic areas, with the exception of CaO and Cr. Likewise, the soil mineralogy was statistically significant for iron oxide, feldspars, mica and chlorite. Smectite and kaolinite clays were widely present and elicited a strong HA, as did quartz, in comparison to other mineral phases tested, although no strong difference was found in HA between soils from the two areas. The relationship was further investigated with principle component analysis (PCA), which showed that a combination of an increase in Y, Zr and Al2O3, and a concurrent increase Fe2O3, TiO2, MnO and Ba in the soils increased HA.The mineralogy and chemistry of the soils influenced the HA, although the interplay between the components is complex. Further research should consider the variable biopersistance, hygroscopicity and hardness of the minerals and further characterize the nano-scale particles."

In this study we monitor the development of flap edema in a series of 18 prefabricated flaps and aim to delineate the natural history of this phenomenon by use of lymphography. METHODS:Postoperative swelling was monitored in a series of 18 pre-expanded prefabricated cervical skin flaps used for hemi-facial burns-scar resurfacing. Time to spontaneous resolution, presence or absence of venous congestion, and clinical outcome were recorded. In two cases, indocyanine-green (ICG) lymphography was used to monitor the dermal backflow pattern until swelling had completely resolved. Average moving velocity of ICG after injection as well as flap thickness was also recorded over the follow-up period. RESULTS:The average moving velocity of ICG in the flap lymphatics improved from 0.48 cm/min to 1.5 cm/min in the first 12 days after flap transfer. The dermal backflow pattern was stardust in the first 12 days, indicating moderate lymphedema, transforming to splash from week three, and a robust collecting lymphatic vessel occurring from the fifth month, indicating mild lymphedema and lymphatic channel recovery, respectively. CONCLUSION:Transient swelling was observed in all prefabricated flaps in our series. We postulate that this is mostly secondary to lymphatic disruption that subsides as lymphangiogenesis takes place. ICG lymphography is an inexpensive, safe, and easy-to-use imaging technology that could be used in the monitoring of postoperative lymphedema seen in prefabricated flaps."

This assessment emphasized the lack of appropriate animal models recapitulating the natural history of this disease. Childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the result of complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and exposure to exogenous agents. The most common chromosomal alteration is the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene, which confers a low risk of developing the malignancy by originating a preleukemic clone requiring secondary hits for full-blown disease to appear. To develop potential prophylactic interventions, we need to identify the environmental triggers of the second hit. Recently, we generated a B-ALL mouse model of the human ETV6-RUNX1+ preleukemic state. Here, we present the results from the ARIMMORA pilot study, obtained by exposing 34 Sca1-ETV6-RUNX1 mice (vs. 27 unexposed) to a 50 Hz magnetic field of 1.5 mT with both fundamental and harmonic content, with an on/off cycle of 10 min/5 min, for 20 h/day, from conception until 3 months of age. Mice were monitored until 2 years of age and peripheral blood was periodically analyzed by flow cytometry. One of the exposed mice developed B-ALL while none of the non-exposed did. Although the results are statistically non-significant due to the limited number of mice used in this pilot experiment, overall, the results show that the newly developed Sca1-ETV6-RUNX1 mouse can be successfully used for ELF-MF exposure studies about the etiology of childhood B-ALL.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study in two academic institutions. METHODS: We evaluated 319 patients before microlaryngoscopy for benign and malignant glottic diseases by a standardized preoperative assessment protocol (Laryngoscore) that included 11 parameters: interincisors gap (IIG), thyro-mental distance, upper jaw dental status, trismus, mandibular prognathism, macroglossia, micrognathia, degree of neck flexion-extension, history of previous open-neck and/or radiotherapy, Mallampati's modified score, and body mass index (BMI). Each parameter was assessed to obtain a total score. Patients were divided into five classes according to the anterior commissure (AC) visualization: class 0, complete AC visualization with large-bore laryngoscopes in the Boyce-Jackson position; class I, as class 0 with external laryngeal counterpressure; class II, as class I in the flexion-flexion position; class III, as class II using small-bore laryngoscopes; and class IV, impossible AC visualization. RESULTS: Class 0-I-II (good/acceptable laryngeal exposure) presented a median score < 6. This value was chosen as cutoff for distinguishing favorable versus difficult/impossible laryngeal exposures. When the Laryngoscore was < 6, good laryngeal exposure was observed in 94% of patients, whereas when ≥ 6, DLE was encountered in 40%.

This study investigated in the dog renal functional and electrolyte abnormalities during and for 20 days following a 10-day course of low-dose gentamicin (7 mg/kg/day), high-dose gentamicin (30 mg/kg/day), and netilmicin (30 mg/kg/day). Renal histology was examined at the end of the study. Renal functional abnormalities occurred only in animals receiving high-dose gentamicin. A fall in maximal urinary osmolality (1579 +/- 347 mOsm/kg/H2O to 450 +/- 118, p less than 0.05) was followed by renal glycosuria and a fall in GFR (66.9 +/- 11.9 ml/min to 21.3 +/- 8.6, p less than 0.05). These three functional indices had recovered by day 30 in the survivors. Plasma potassium fell in animals receiving high-dose gentamicin (3.8 +/- 0.02 mEq/L to 3.3 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.05) and reached the lowest values (2.7 and 2.9 mEq/L) just prior to death in two animals dying in uremia. Netilmicin also caused a significant fall in plasma potassium (4.3 +/- 0.1 mEq/L to 3.9 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05). Hypocalcemia (10.0 +/- 1.3 mg/dl to 7.8 +/- 1.4, p less than 0.05) but not hypomagnesemia developed following high-dose gentamicin. Peak serum aminoglycoside levels after high-dose gentamicin and netilmicin were comparable, but trough levels rose only in high-dose gentamicin animals and paralleled the fall in GFR. Light microscopy of the kidney 3 weeks after high-dose gentamicin demonstrated no proximal tubular necrosis but extensive focal tubulointerstitial nephritis, especially in the juxtamedullary cortex. Similar but less extensive derangements were noted in animals receiving low-dose gentamicin, despite the absence of functional abnormalities. Minor histological abnormalities were noted in animals receiving netilmicin. To summarize: 1) major renal functional and electrolyte abnormalities developed only following high-dose gentamicin and included impaired urinary concentration, glycosuria, reduced GFR, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia (except for a fall in plasma potassium, similar doses of netilmicin were not nephrotoxic); (2) tubulointerstitial nephritis, particularly in the juxtamedullary cortex, occurred with low-dose gentamicin as well as high-dose gentamicin and may be a factor in delayed or incomplete recovery from gentamicin nephrotoxicity; (3) in this model, netilmicin at comparable doses was substantially less nephrotoxic than gentamicin; (4) renal postassium wasting may be a heretofore unrecognized consequence of aminoglycoside administration."

They are rare, odontogenic tumors, thought to be composed of the epithelium of ectodermal origin, which means they are tumors arising from the cells around the tooth root, or in close approximation, derived from the ectoderm germ layer. Ameloblastomas represent about 1% of all jaw tumors, but they are the second-most common odontogenic tumor. They are much more common in the lower jaw than in the upper jaw, and more common in the posterior mandible as compared to the anterior. The vast majority of the time, they are a benign tumor with aggressive behavior; however, rarely they can develop into, or be associated with, a malignancy (malignant ameloblastoma or ameloblastic carcinoma). It is extremely rare to find ameloblastomas outside the maxilla and mandible due to the association with teeth and their structures. Anatomy: There are 20 deciduous teeth (“baby teeth”) and 32 permanent teeth (generally depending on third molar development or wisdom teeth) that start to appear in the mouth around 6 years of age. The last four permanent teeth to erupt are third molars or ""wisdom teeth,"" each of which may or may not grow in. Among deciduous teeth, ten usually are found in the maxilla (upper jaw), and ten are in the mandible (lower jaw). For permanent teeth, 16 are in the maxilla, and 16 are in the mandible. There are specific anatomic landmarks unique to each type of tooth which define them as incisors, molars, canines, etc. The anatomy of the tooth itself consists of the root which is hidden in the gums, and the crown, or visible part. The root of the tooth is anchored to the bone to which it is associated and allows for blood flow and nerve supply to the tooth to maintain viability. This system of ligamentous attachment connecting the tooth to the surrounding socket is called the periodontium. The hard tissue covering the crown is the enamel. The root is covered by cementum, a substance that is a hardy mineral but softer than enamel.  Natural History: The vast majority of ameloblastomas are benign and slow-growing, with locally aggressive behavior, which can lead to significant pathology and require extensive surgical treatment. The abnormal cell growth easily infiltrates local tissue, typically bone. Surgical excision is usually needed to treat this disorder. It has a high propensity for local recurrence even with proper surgical management and requires lifelong follow up for surveillance. Patterns of spread: Amelomlastomas spread locally, invading surrounding tissues. They spread through bone and can invade soft tissues as well if given enough time to do so. However, this is a benign tumor so metastasis to lymph nodes, distant sites, etc., is rare and changes the staging to malignant. The thinking is that malignant ameloblastomas comprise less than 1% of all ameloblastomas."

This is partly due to considerable inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity. Changes in the cellular energy-producing mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (MRC) activities are a hallmark of glioblastoma relative to the normal brain, and associate with differential survival outcomes. Targeting MRC complexes with drugs can also facilitate anti-glioblastoma activity. Whether mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encode several components of the MRC contribute to these phenomena remains underexplored. We identified a germ-line mtDNA mutation (m. 14798T > C), enriched in glioblastoma relative to healthy controls, that causes an amino acid substitution F18L within the core mtDNA-encoded cytochrome b subunit of MRC complex III. F18L is predicted to alter corresponding complex III activity, and sensitivity to complex III-targeting drugs. This could in turn alter reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell behaviour and, consequently, patient outcomes. Here we show that, despite a heterogeneous mitochondrial background in adult glioblastoma patient biopsy-derived cell cultures, the F18L substitution associates with alterations in individual MRC complex activities, in particular a 75% increase in MRC complex II_III activity, and a 34% reduction in CoQ10, the natural substrate for MRC complex III, levels. Downstream characterisation of an F18L-carrier revealed an 87% increase in intra-cellular ROS, an altered cellular distribution of mitochondrial-specific ROS, and a 64% increased sensitivity to clomipramine, a repurposed MRC complex III-targeting drug. In patients, F18L-carriers that received the current standard of care treatment had a poorer prognosis than non-carriers (373 days vs. 415 days, respectively). Single germ-line mitochondrial mutations could predispose individuals to differential prognoses, and sensitivity to mitochondrial targeted drugs. Thus, F18L, which is present in blood could serve as a useful non-invasive biomarker for the stratification of patients into prognostically relevant groups, one of which requires a lower dose of clomipramine to achieve clinical effect, thus minimising side-effects."

METHODS:This single-center retrospective study included 39 infants (42 eyes) aged ≤3 months who were diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral advanced intraocular retinoblastoma (group D and E eyes) and received IAC as primary or secondary treatment between June 2012 and February 2017. Based on each patient's therapeutic history and response to chemotherapeutic drugs, melphalan, topotecan, and/or carboplatin were used for IAC. The main outcomes included the technical success rate for IAC, survival rates, and adverse events. RESULTS:In total, 29 and 13 eyes received IAC as primary and secondary treatments, respectively. Catheterization was successful in 136 of 137 procedures. All eyes in the secondary IAC group had previously received intravenous chemotherapy. The mean number of IAC sessions for each eye was 3 (range, 2-6). The 2-year ocular survival rates were 80.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58.9-91.7) in the primary IAC group and 91.7% (95% CI, 53.9-98.8) in the secondary IAC group. During the follow-up period, 1 patient with unilateral disease (group E) developed extraocular disease and died. The 2-year recurrence-free survival rates in the primary and secondary IAC groups were 71.9% (95% CI, 49.4-85.7) and 75.0% (95% CI, 40.8-91.2), respectively. During each catheterization procedure, the main complications included eyelid erythema (2.4%), fundus hemorrhage (11.9%), myelosuppression (7.7%), transient vomiting and hair loss (2.6%), and transient pancytopenia (2.6%). Prolonged complications included phthisis bulbi (19.0%), vision loss (19.0%), poor vision (9.5%), and cataract (2.4%). There was no case of stroke, neurological impairment, secondary malignant tumor, or metastasis. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings suggest that IAC, whether primary or secondary, is effective and fairly safe for the management of advanced retinoblastoma in infants aged < 3 months. However, adverse events related to intra-arterial injection and the visual outcomes cannot be neglected and require further investigation."

GCIII, a single-arm observational study, used new risk stratification, replaced consolidation chemotherapy with a standard number of cycles and introduced surveillance for all stage I MGCTs. Pure teratomas were registered to understand their natural history. METHODS:Patients with MGCTs were stratified to three risk groups - low risk (LR), intermediate risk (IR) and high risk (HR), using stage and prognostic factors. Patients with alpha fetoprotein (AFP) >10,000 kU/L, stage IV disease (except testis <5 years and all germinomas) or stage II-IV mediastinal tumour were classified HR. Stage I tumours (LR) received chemotherapy only if disease progressed. IR and HR patients received 4 and 6 JEB cycles, respectively. Carboplatin dose was calculated using glomerular filtration rate to give an area under the curve of 7.9 ml/m2.min. RESULTS:Eighty-six patients with MGCTs were enrolled from 2005 to 2009: 59% female, median age, 5.7 years. Twenty-five patients were LR, 21 IR and 38 HR. Seven LR patients had disease progression; all were successfully treated with chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) for the whole group was 97%; 5-year event-free survival for JEb-treated patients was 92%, and OS, 95%. JEb was well tolerated with no observed significant hearing or renal side-effects. There was no discernible difference in carboplatin dose whether calculated by body surface area or creatinine clearance. Forty-seven patients with teratoma were managed with surgery and one had malignant transformation. CONCLUSION:Carboplatin-based chemotherapy as part of a risk-stratified approach leads to excellent survival in paediatric MGCTs, minimising potential burden of long-term effects."

In most publications, affected patients were identified during the investigation of various complaints. METHODS:Using a cross-sectional multicenter retrospective natural history study, we describe the course of all known CMAMMA individuals in the province of Quebec. RESULTS:We identified 25 CMAMMA patients (6 months to 30 years old) with a favorable outcome regardless of treatment. All but one came to clinical attention through the Provincial Neonatal Urine Screening Program (screening on day 21 of life). Median methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels ranged from 107 to 857 mmol/mol creatinine in urine (<10) and from 8 to 42 μmol/L in plasma (<0.4); median urine malonic acid (MA) levels ranged from 9 to 280 mmol/mol creatinine (<5). MMA was consistently higher than MA. These findings are comparable to those previously reported in CMAMMA. Causal ACSF3 mutations were identified in all patients for whom genotyping was performed (76% of cases). The most common ACSF3 mutations in our cohort were c.1075G > A (p.E359K) and c.1672C > T (p.R558W), representing 38.2 and 20.6% of alleles in genotyped families, respectively; we also report several novel mutations. CONCLUSION:Because our province still performs urine newborn screening, our patient cohort is the only one free of selection bias. Therefore, the favorable clinical course observed suggests that CMAMMA is probably a benign condition, although we cannot exclude the possibility that a small minority of patients may present symptoms attributable to CMAMMA, perhaps as a result of interactions with other genetic or environmental factors."

The disease is characterized by the triad of arterial tortuosity and aneurysms, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula or cleft palate and is caused by heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding transforming growth factor beta receptors 1 and 2 (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, respectively). METHODS: We undertook the clinical and molecular characterization of 52 affected families. Forty probands presented with typical manifestations of the Loeys-Dietz syndrome. In view of the phenotypic overlap between this syndrome and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, we screened an additional cohort of 40 patients who had vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome without the characteristic type III collagen abnormalities or the craniofacial features of the Loeys-Dietz syndrome. RESULTS: We found a mutation in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 in all probands with typical Loeys-Dietz syndrome (type I) and in 12 probands presenting with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Loeys-Dietz syndrome type II). The natural history of both types was characterized by aggressive arterial aneurysms (mean age at death, 26.0 years) and a high incidence of pregnancy-related complications (in 6 of 12 women). Patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type I, as compared with those with type II, underwent cardiovascular surgery earlier (mean age, 16.9 years vs. 26.9 years) and died earlier (22.6 years vs. 31.8 years). There were 59 vascular surgeries in the cohort, with one death during the procedure. This low rate of intraoperative mortality distinguishes the Loeys-Dietz syndrome from vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in either TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 predispose patients to aggressive and widespread vascular disease. The severity of the clinical presentation is predictive of the outcome. Genotyping of patients presenting with symptoms like those of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may be used to guide therapy, including the use and timing of prophylactic vascular surgery."

Recent observation on cases of maternal phenylalaninemia who were detected through unselected screening indicate that the reproductive risk associated with the condition may have been overstimated in the past. This risk is concentrated in mothers who had been affected themselves. Mental level appears to be a stronger predictor of reproductive outcome in phenylalaninemic women than the degree of phenylalaninemia. Selective prenatal intervention based on maternal mental level is not possible, however, where the natural history of the condition has been altered. This is the case in phenylketonuric girls who has been treated during childhood. These girls are now reaching child-bearing age in fast growing numbers, as a result of screening for phenylketonuria. Prenatal intervention is appropriate for all of them until predictors are established that can identify those at risk of reproductive casualty."

Measles has been analyzed extensively as a paradigm for consumer-resource dynamics due to the oscillatory nature of the host-pathogen life cycle, the abundance of rich data to test theory, and public health relevance. The dynamics of measles in London, in particular, has acted as a prototypical test bed for such analysis using incidence data from the pre-vaccination era (1944-1967). However, during this timeframe there were few external large-scale perturbations, limiting an assessment of the relative impact of internal and extra demographic perturbations to the host population. Here, we extended the previous London analyses to include nearly a century of data that also contains four major demographic changes: the First and Second World Wars, the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the start of a measles mass vaccination program. By combining mortality and incidence data using particle filtering methods, we show that a simple stochastic epidemic model, with minimal historical specifications, can capture the nearly 100 years of dynamics including changes caused by each of the major perturbations. We show that the majority of dynamic changes are explainable by the internal nonlinear dynamics of the system, tuned by demographic changes. In addition, the 1918 influenza pandemic and World War II acted as extra perturbations to this basic epidemic oscillator.

In several cases, models that make the simplifying assumption of homogeneous time-dependent transmission rates give good agreement with data in the absence of secular trends in population demography or transmission. The prime example is afforded by the dynamics of measles in industrialized countries in the pre-vaccine era. Accurate description of the transient dynamics following the introduction of routine vaccination has proved more challenging, however. This is true even in the case of measles which has a well-understood natural history and an effective vaccine that confers long-lasting protection against infection. Here, to shed light on the causes of this problem, we demonstrate that, while the dynamics of homogeneous and age-structured models can be qualitatively similar in the absence of vaccination, they diverge subsequent to vaccine roll-out. In particular, we show that immunization induces changes in transmission rates, which in turn reshapes the age distribution of infection prevalence, which effectively modulates the amplitude of seasonality in such systems. To examine this phenomenon empirically, we fit transmission models to measles notification data from London that span the introduction of the vaccine. We find that a simple age-structured model provides a much better fit to the data than does a homogeneous model, especially in the transition period from the pre-vaccine to the vaccine era. Thus, we propose that age structure and heterogeneities in contact rates are critical features needed to accurately capture transient dynamics in the presence of secular trends."

Vaccination programs often depend on a combination of routine and non-routine services, including supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) and vaccination weeks (VWs), that both aim to vaccinate all eligible children regardless of vaccination history or natural infection. Madagascar has used a combination of these activities to improve measles coverage. However, ongoing massive measles outbreak suggests that the country was in a ""honeymoon"" period and that coverage achieved needs to be re-evaluated. Although healthcare access is expected to vary seasonally in low resources settings, little evidence exists to quantify temporal fluctuations in routine vaccination, and interactions with other immunization activities. METHODS:We used three data sources: national administrative data on measles vaccine delivery from 2013 to 2016, digitized vaccination cards from 49 health centers in 6 health districts, and a survey of health workers. Data were analyzed using linear regressions, analysis of variance, and t-tests. FINDINGS:From 2013 to 2016, the footprint of SIAs and VWs is apparent, with more doses distributed during the relevant timeframes. Routine vaccination decreases in subsequent months, suggesting that additional activities may be interfering with routine services. The majority of missed vaccination opportunities occur during the rainy season. Health facility organization and shortage of vaccine contributed to vaccination gaps. Children born in June were the least likely to be vaccinated on time. DISCUSSION:Evidence that routine vaccination coverage varies over the year and is diminished by other activities suggests that maintaining routine vaccination during SIAs and VWs is a key direction for strengthening immunization programs, ensuring population immunity and avoiding future outbreaks.

In India, measles vaccine is administered alone or as MMR at 9 months age. Varicella vaccine is not routinely used. Immunization age is a function of disappearance of maternal antibodies and natural exposure of the children to the pathogens. In view of the measles-WHO-initiative, we aimed to assess if the current immunization age for measles is still valid. In addition, the kinetics of IgG and IgM antibodies against rubella, mumps and varicella viruses was also examined. METHODS:This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Pune, India. A total of 600 children, 150 each in 6-month/9-month (no vaccination) and 12-month/15-month (minimum 4 weeks post-measles-vaccine) cohorts were included. History of these infections and birth status (term/preterm) was recorded. All serum samples were screened for IgG-anti-MMRV-antibodies while IgG-positives were tested for specific IgM antibodies (ELISA). RESULTS:At 6-months, the prevalence of MMRV antibodies was 4.7%, 2.7%, 10.7%, 5.3% respectively depicting disappearance of maternal antibodies in majority of the children. Birth status did not influence antibody positivity. Despite vaccination at ∼9-months, >25% children were still susceptible to measles virus at the age of 12/15-months. The ratio of clinical:subclinical infections was 4:10 (measles) and 12:1 (varicella). All the mumps/rubella IgM positives (1 and 2 respectively) represented subclinical infections. CONCLUSION:Demonstration of early disappearance of maternal antibodies against MMRV viruses leading to the risk of these infections at an early age emphasize need for early immunization of Indian children. Suboptimal response to measles vaccine needs to be seriously addressed especially in view of the WHO's initiative for measles eradication."

For such monitoring to be feasible, a cost-effective, reliable and high-throughput assay is necessary. Herein we describe an ELISA protocol for assessment of anti-measles antibody levels in human serum samples that fulfills the above criteria and is easily adaptable by various laboratories. A serum bank of anonymous patient sera was established (N > 3000 samples). Sera were grouped based on measles immunization schedules and/or changes in vaccine components since the introduction of the first measles vaccine in Hungary in 1969. Newly designed ELISA was performed by using Siemens BEP 2000 Advance System and data were confirmed using commercially available kits. Our indirect ELISA was compared to indirect immunfluoresence and to anti-measles nucleocapsid (N) monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISA. The results obtained are in high agreement with the confirmatory methods, and reflect measles vaccination history in Hungary ranging from pre-vaccination era, through the initial period of measles vaccination, to present. Based on measurement of 1985 sera, the highest ratio of low/questionable antibody level samples was detected in cluster '1978-1987' (~25.4%), followed by cluster '1969-1977' (~15.4%).Our assay is suitable for assessment of anti-measles immunity in a large cohort of subjects. The assay is cost-effective, allows high-throughput screening and has superior signal-to-noise ratio. This assay can serve as a first step in assessment of the effectiveness of all three components of the MMR vaccine."

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]"

The literature on fetal megacystis was systematically reviewed, focusing on prenatal diagnosis, associations and outcomes. This yielded a total of 18 primary references and eight secondary references. Fetal megacystis has an estimated first-trimester prevalence of between 1:330 and 1:1670, with a male to female ratio of 8:1. In the first trimester, megacystis is most commonly defined as a longitudinal bladder dimension of ≥7 mm. Later in pregnancy, a sagittal dimension (in mm) greater than gestational age (in weeks) + 12 is often accepted. Megacystis can be associated with a thickened bladder wall, which has been objectively defined as >3 mm. Oligohydramnios is present in approximately half of all cases. The most common underlying diagnosis is posterior urethral valves (57%), followed by urethral atresia/stenosis (7%), prune belly syndrome (4%), megacystis-microcolon-intestinal-hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) (1%), and cloacal anomalies (0.7%). Karyotype anomalies are found in 15%, and include trisomy 18, trisomy 13 and trisomy 21. Ultrasound imaging alone is often insufficient to enable a definitive diagnosis, although it may indicate that a specific diagnosis is more likely. Overall, about 50% of reported fetuses with megacystis are terminated, but this proportion varies considerably between countries and over time. Prognostic stratification is evolving, with the most important factors being oligohydramnios, gestational age at diagnosis, degree of bladder enlargement, renal hyperechogenicity, karyotype, and sex. CONCLUSIONS:This review demonstrated some consensus on the ultrasound criteria for defining fetal megacystis, and illustrated the spectrum of pathologies and their relative frequencies that can cause this condition. It also underlined important associated karyotype anomalies. To progress understanding of the natural history of enlarged fetal bladders, more accurate diagnostics are required, and risk stratification needs to be refined to facilitate prenatal counseling."

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]"

Individuals with AS due to a UBE3A mutation are more likely to have siblings who also have AS compared with those with AS due to other cytogenetic/molecular mechanisms, but it is unknown whether the developmental outcome of siblings who have AS is similar. METHODS:Through an ongoing AS Natural History Study, we identified seven pairs of siblings with AS due to a UBE3A mutation. We compared the neurodevelopment of the first-born and second-born siblings with AS participants who have a UBE3A mutation and have either typically developing siblings or no siblings. RESULTS:Second-born AS participants due to a UBE3A mutation were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier age. With the exception of higher expressive language scores among the second-born participants, no other differences were observed in the developmental and adaptive functioning skills across the different groups. CONCLUSIONS:The presence of an older sibling with the same neurodevelopmental disorder is associated with an earlier age of diagnosis and may be associated with an improvement in expressive language skills; the developmental outcome of siblings with AS due to a UBE3A mutation is otherwise comparable."

Angiotropism, a marker of extravascular migration of melanoma cells along vascular channels, often appears responsible for microscopic satellite, satellite and in transit metastases development in cutaneous melanoma. In addition, diffuse tissue microscopic satellites are correlated with widespread melanoma dissemination and death. Herein we report rapid conjunctival melanoma progression and a fatal outcome in four of five patients following recurrence as satellite in transit metastases. Five patients aged 31, 60, 63, 56, and 67 years developed primary conjunctival melanoma, histologically characterised by tumour thicknesses of 4, 4, 1.1, 3, and 2 mm. Two or more conjunctival melanomas manifested ulceration, significant mitotic rates, necrosis, angiotropism, and intralesional transformation. The conjunctival melanoma recurred in a matter of months as one or more discrete satellite in transit lesions in the vicinity of the primary melanoma. Histological examination revealed well-defined micronodules containing atypical melanocytes in the subepithelial connective tissue stroma. All lesions were extravascular and most appeared angiotropic. Four of five patients subsequently developed parotid or other loco-regional nodal disease and rapidly ensuing widespread metastases and death. The time course from diagnosis to the demise of the patients averaged about 13 (range 7-20) months. Our findings suggest that satellite in transit metastases constitute an important new risk marker for possible rapid metastatic disease progression and death in patients with conjunctival melanoma. This finding appears to take on even greater significance if such lesions develop rapidly, i.e., in a matter of weeks or months following diagnosis of primary conjunctival melanoma, and if the primary melanoma manifests additional high-risk features. Additional studies are underway in order to further elucidate the mechanism of these metastases."

As a base estimate, imaging was assumed to detect regional and distant recurrences of which 80% and 20% could be surgically treated with curative intent, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for all point estimates. For each disease stage, we calculated the number of surgically treatable regional or distant recurrence detected during 5 years per 10,000 patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans at 6- or 12-month intervals. The associated positive and negative predictive values and life expectancy were also calculated and compared with clinical examination alone.At 5-year follow-up, CT or PET/CT at 6-month intervals detected surgically treatable regional or distant recurrence in 6.4% of patients with stage I, 18.5% of stage II, and 33.1% of stage III disease; 12-month intervals decreased the rates to 3.0%, 7.9%, and 13.0%, respectively. The high false-positive rates of CT (20%) and PET/CT (9%) resulted in overall low positive predictive values. However, both CT and PET/CT effectively predicted absence of disease.

Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed hemosiderin deposition throughout the brain cortical layer and in the cerebellum, affecting the dentate nucleus as well. A computed tomography revealed an osteolytic formation in the clivus, involving the inner bone table and bone marrow. The patient was then submitted to an endoscopic endonasal transclival approach to close the defect. CONCLUSIONS:SS may be a result of several etiologies generating repetitive meningeal bleeding.

There were no children with lipomyelomeningocele. All children were free of neurological symptoms until 94 months after the initial surgery. Subsequently, one child exhibited delayed neurological deficits and underwent a second surgery because of motor and sensory disturbances; slight sensory disturbance was noted at the final follow-up examination.

The patients present with congenital herniation of brain tissue from the anterior cranial fossa through a defect in the facial skeleton. Associated craniofacial deformities include hypertelorism, orbital dystopia, and elongation of the face. The natural history of the disease is progressive, and the life expectancy of affected patients is drastically reduced. Conventional surgical therapy includes extracranial and intracranial approaches with frontal craniotomy or trepanation of the frontal bone. METHODS: Given a lack of appropriate facilities in a developing country in the Third World, the authors operated on 52 Burmese patients with frontoethmoidal meningoceles using a purely extracranial approach. RESULTS: Twenty nasofrontal, 16 nasoethmoidal, one nasoorbital, and 15 combined nasoethmoidal/nasoorbital meningoencephaloceles were surgically treated. Early cerebrospinal rhinorrhea was observed in 15 patients, and one of them required operative dural repair by means of an intracranial approach. In the other 14 patients, rhinorrhea resolved spontaneously. None of the patients developed meningitis or other infections of the central nervous system. There were no perioperative or postoperative deaths. Two patients developed secondary healing with exposure of wires or screws. CONCLUSIONS: Frontal craniotomy is not mandatory in the treatment of frontoethmoidal meningoencephaloceles. Extracranial correction alone is capable of reliably closing the connection between the intracranial and extracranial spaces, and the incidence of early postoperative complications is low. The extracranial approach may be an attractive option in countries where craniofacial expertise is not available and where surgical facilities are limited."

With improvements in prenatal diagnosis, a defined antenatal natural history, and the concept of fetal intervention to arrest or reverse ongoing in utero damage, maternal-fetal surgery for MMC closure developed as a feasible therapy. Animal studies and early human studies investigating in utero MMC closure were promising, leading to Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS trial).

Global prevalence at birth is approximately 18.6 per 10,000 live births, with more than 300,000 infants with NTDs born every year. Substantial strides have been made in understanding the genetics, pathophysiology, and surgical treatment of NTDs, yet the natural history remains one of high morbidity and profound impairment of quality of life. Direct and indirect costs of care are enormous, which ensures profound inequities and disparities in the burden of disease in countries of low and moderate resources. All indices of disease burden are higher for NTDs in developing countries. The great tragedy is that the majority of NTDs can be prevented with folate fortification of commercially produced food. Unequivocal evidence of the effectiveness of folate to reduce the incidence of NTDs has existed for more than 25 years. Yet, the most comprehensive surveys of effectiveness of implementation strategies show that more than 100 countries fail to fortify, and consequently only 13% of folate-preventable spina bifida is actually prevented. Neurosurgeons harbor a disproportionate, central, and fundamental role in the management of NTDs and enjoy high standing in society. No organized group in medicine can speak as authoritatively or convincingly. As a result, neurosurgeons and organized neurosurgery harbor disproportionate potential to advocate for more comprehensive folate fortification, and thereby prevent the most common and severe birth defect to impact the human nervous system. Assertive, proactive, informed advocacy for folate fortification should be a central and integral part of the neurosurgical approach to NTDs. Only by making the prevention of dysraphism a priority can we best address the inequities often observed worldwide."

It can cause severe lifelong physical and neurodevelopmental disabilities. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that the neurological deficits associated with SBA are not simply caused by incomplete neurulation at the level of the lesion. Additional damage is caused by prolonged exposure of the spinal cord and nerves to the intrauterine environment and a suction gradient due to cerebrospinal fluid leakage, leading to progressive downward displacement of the hindbrain. This natural history can be reversed by prenatal repair. A randomised controlled trial demonstrated that mid-gestational maternal-fetal surgery for SBA decreases the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting and hindbrain herniation at 12 months and improves neurological motor function at 30 months of age. This came at the price of maternal and fetal risks, the most relevant ones being increased prematurity and a persistent uterine corporeal scar. Recently minimally invasive fetal approaches have been introduced clinically yet they lack extensive experimental or clinical trials. We aim to provide clinicians with the essential information necessary to counsel SBA parents as the basis for considering referral of selected patients to expert fetal surgery centres.

In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions."

Clinical sites were selected over a wide geographic range within Latin America and the Caribbean, taking into account the dynamic course of the ZIKV epidemic. METHODS:Recruitment to the PW cohort will take place in antenatal care clinics. PW will be enrolled regardless of symptoms and followed over the course of pregnancy, approximately every 4 weeks. PW will be revisited at delivery (or after miscarriage/abortion) to assess birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities according to the evolving definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). After birth, children will be followed for 2 years in the CH cohort. Follow-up visits are scheduled at ages 1-3, 4-6, 12, and 24 months to assess neurocognitive and developmental milestones. In addition, a NH cohort for the characterization of symptomatic rash/fever illness was designed, including follow-up to capture persisting health problems. Blood, urine, and other biological materials will be collected, and tested for ZIKV and other relevant arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever) using RT-PCR or serological methods. A virtual, decentralized biobank will be created. Reciprocal clinical monitoring has been established between partner sites. Substudies of ZIKV seroprevalence, transmission clustering, disabilities and health economics, viral kinetics, the potential role of antibody enhancement, and co-infections will be linked to the cohort studies. DISCUSSION:Results of these large cohort studies will provide better risk estimates for birth defects and other developmental abnormalities associated with ZIKV infection including possible co-factors for the variability of risk estimates between other countries and regions. Additional outcomes include incidence and transmission estimates of ZIKV during and after pregnancy, characterization of short and long-term clinical course following infection and viral kinetics of ZIKV.

Three environmental MSSA and three environmental MRSA are selected for proteomic profiling using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation tandem mass spectrometry (iTRAQ MS/MS). Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotation are applied to interpret the functions of the proteins detected. 792 proteins are identified in MSSA and MRSA. Comparative analysis of MRSA and MSSA reveals that 8 of out 792 proteins are upregulated and 156 are downregulated. Proteins that have differences in abundance are predominantly involved in catalytic and binding activity. Among 164 differently abundant proteins, 29 are involved in pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, stress response, mismatch repair, and cell wall synthesis. Twenty-two proteins associated with pathogenicity including SPA, SBI, CLFA, and DLT are upregulated in MRSA.

OBJECTIVE:To retrospectively study outcome of conservative treatment in patients with low output (<200 ml/day) EPF with DPDS following percutaneous or surgical intervention in acute necrotising pancreatitis (ANP). METHODS:The data of patients of low output EPF with DPDS treated conservatively in our unit over last 5 years was retrospectively analysed. Their clinical course, complications as well as time taken for fistula closure was retrieved. RESULTS:33 patients (27 males; mean age: 40.5 ± 9.3 years) of low output EPF and DPDS were studied. 31 patients developed EPF following percutaneous drainage (PCD) and 2 patients developed fistula following surgery. The drain fluid amylase ranged from 1600 to 32,000 IU/l and site of disruption was neck, proximal body and distal body in 4, 16 and 13 patients respectively. EPF closed spontaneously in all patients within 88.2 ± 63.46 days. PCD slipped out in 2 patients and led to formation of pseudocyst in 1 patient that was treated endoscopically. There has been no recurrence in any patient over follow up of 32.5 ± 21.9 months. CONCLUSION:Low output EPF developing post PCD or surgery in patients with DPDS following ANP closely spontaneously in majority of patients within 3 months with good long term outcome."

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]"

Costello syndrome is typically characterized by failure to thrive in infancy as a result of severe postnatal feeding difficulties; short stature; developmental delay or intellectual disability; coarse facial features (full lips, large mouth, full nasal tip); curly or sparse, fine hair; loose, soft skin with deep palmar and plantar creases; papillomata of the face and perianal region; diffuse hypotonia and joint laxity with ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers; tight Achilles tendons; and cardiac involvement including: cardiac hypertrophy (usually typical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), congenital heart defect (usually valvar pulmonic stenosis), and arrhythmia (usually supraventricular tachycardia, especially chaotic atrial rhythm/multifocal atrial tachycardia or ectopic atrial tachycardia). Relative or absolute macrocephaly is typical, and postnatal cerebellar overgrowth can result in the development of a Chiari I malformation with associated anomalies including hydrocephalus or syringomyelia. Individuals with Costello syndrome have an approximately 15% lifetime risk for malignant tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma in young children and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in adolescents and young adults. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of Costello syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous HRAS pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Failure to thrive is the most common and challenging clinical problem; most infants require nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding; many require Nissen fundoplication. Treatment of cardiac manifestations and malignancy is routine. Ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers often requires early bracing and occupational and/or physical therapy; tight Achilles tendons may require surgical tendon lengthening. Developmental disability requires early-intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Recurrent facial papillomata may require routine removal with dry ice. Hemodynamically significant valvar stenoses require antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis; anesthesia may pose a risk to those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or those predisposed to some types of atrial tachycardia. Surveillance: Monitoring for neonatal hypoglycemia; echocardiography with electrocardiogram at diagnosis with subsequent follow up by a cardiologist who is aware of the spectrum of cardiac disease and its natural history; abdominal and pelvic ultrasound examinations to screen for rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma every three to six months until age eight to ten years may be considered; annual urinalysis for evidence of hematuria to screen for bladder cancer beginning at age ten years. GENETIC COUNSELING:Costello syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands with Costello syndrome have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; although parents of probands are not affected, vertical transmission has been reported in two families with the rare, attenuated phenotype. Because Costello syndrome is typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of a proband is presumed to be small; however, recurrence in sibs has been reported and is suspected to be the result of germline mosaicism in a parent. Individuals with Costello syndrome typically do not reproduce. Once an HRAS pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible."

Most noteworthy among these are Recognition of the probable heterogeneity of migraine, not merely in the manifestation of symptoms but, more importantly, in the existence of distinct etiologic subtypes. A number of findings suggest that some migraine subtypes are sensitive to certain precipitants, some appear to be a part of a more generalized constitutional disorder, and some are accompanied by a higher prevalence of migraine among family members. Efforts should be made in understanding the relationship between specific biochemical markers and traits (such as monoamine oxidase deficiency and tyramine sensitivity); precipitants related to the migraine attack; and epidemiologic characteristics such as age at onset and sex. Creation of a more precise, reliable, and practically useful definition of migraine. Without such a definition, it is difficult, if not impossible, to compare results between studies, to understand the relationship between risk factors and migraine subtypes, to understand properly associations identified in selected clinic populations, and, in general, to understand the epidemiology of migraine. More accurate characterization of the case group under study. More documentation of the age at onset, symptoms, frequency of attacks, and other characteristics related to migraine would be very useful to compare properly results between studies.

Clinical examination, radiographic findings, and natural history.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8829034,"Numerous clinical features of hallux limitus/rigidus have been previously reported as isolated entities based on individual case review or myopic observations. Few attempts have been made to synthesize a comprehensive natural history which correlates the inter-relationship of these findings. Frequently unrecognized or overlooked subtle clinical findings, such as shoe-wear patterns, hyperkeratoses locations, and gait disturbances, precede significant radiographic changes or painful degenerative arthritis by months to years. Recognition of these subtle clinical features will aid in establishing an early and accurate diagnosis, and provide the physician with an opportunity to institute treatment prior to the need for surgical reconstruction. Several conclusions can be made regarding the natural history of hallux rigidus. 1. Predisposing factors (pes planovalgus, uncompensated varus) lead to spastic contracture of the hallux (hallux equinus). 2. A shift in the axis of movement occurs within the first metatarsophalangeal joint, from centrally within the metatarsal head to plantarly at the level of the sesamoidophalangeal ligament. 3. Dorsal articular impingement of the proximal phalangeal base on the metatarsal head leads to either a chronic erosion of the dorsal metatarsal head (chondritis dissecans), or fracture through the subchondral bone plate (osteochondritis dissecans). 4. Progressive degenerative arthritis within the first metatarsophalangeal joint appears as joint space narrowing, dorsal osteophyte proliferation, subchondral cyst formation and sclerosis, and articular flattening. 5. Synovial effusion produces periarticular pain, resulting in chronic splinting of the hallux. 6. Auto-fusion of the metatarsophalangeal joint represents the end-stage progression of hallux rigidus. In addition to degeneration of the metatarsophalangeal joint, sesamoid degeneration further compounds joint immobility. 1. Sesamoid immobility from chronic spasm leads to traction proliferation of the sesamoid bones (hypertrophy). 2. Disuse osteopenia of the sesamoids is an indication of sesamoid-metatarsal degeneration, and parallels degenerative changes of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. 3. Proximal sesamoid retraction reflects the degree of hallux equinus. Metatarsus primus elevatus is a co-existant feature of hallux limitus and hallux rigidus. 1. Primary metatarsus primus elevatus is encountered in patients with a more proximal level of uncompensated varus, with hallux equinus occurring secondarily in an attempt to provide medial column support. 2. Secondary metatarsus primus elevatus results from the retrograde effects of hallux equinus on the first metatarsal, and occurs in patients with pes planovalgus. 3. Flexor stabilization syndrome of the hallux occurs in patients with pes planovalgus, and is analogous to a flexor stabilization hammertoe of the lesser digits. 4. Differentiation between primary and secondary metatarsus primus elevatus is made by evaluation of weight-bearing radiographs, comparing the standard lateral radiograph to a lateral radiograph using a forefoot block test, in which the digits are suspended off of the weight-bearing surface."

MKD is characterized by recurrent febrile attacks that are frequently accompanied by lymphadenopathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgia, myalgia, skin rash, and aphthous ulcers. Patients with MVA also have intrauterine growth retardation, congenital defects (cataracts, shortened limbs, and dysmorphic craniofacial features), neurological disease, and failure to thrive. Mean age at onset of symptoms is within the first year of life. There is a delay by several years between symptom onset and diagnosis, which is in part attributable to the initial misdiagnosis due to the rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations of disease. The frequency of recurrent febrile attacks is highest in childhood and gradually decreases after adolescence. MKD is associated with rare long-term complications such as type AA amyloidosis, joint contractures, abdominal adhesions, renal angiomyolipoma, and severe pneumococcal infections. Frequent febrile attacks significantly impair several aspects of patients' and caregivers' quality of life, with an adverse impact on patients' daily activities, education, and employment.

This study was undertaken to determine the characteristics, presentation, natural history, and response to treatment in 46 patients who had been referred for evaluation at the UK National Amyloidosis Centre. METHODS: Disease activity was monitored by serial measurement of serum amyloid A. Renal function was assessed by measurement of serum creatinine and albumin levels, the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria from 24-hour urine collections. The amyloid load was measured by serum amyloid P scintigraphy. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had familial Mediterranean fever, 12 patients had tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, 6 patients had cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, and 4 patients had mevalonate kinase deficiency. The median age at onset of HPFS was 5 years; median age at presentation with AA amyloidosis was 38 years. Diagnosis of an HPFS had not been considered prior to presentation with AA amyloidosis in 23 patients (50%). Eleven patients (24%) had end-stage renal failure (ESRF) at presentation; of these, 3 had received transplants prior to referral. A further 13 patients developed ESRF over the followup period, with 10 undergoing renal transplantation. The median time to progression to ESRF from onset of AA amyloidosis was 3.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2-8), with a median time to transplant of 4 years (IQR 3-6). Eleven patients (24%) died. The median survival in the entire cohort was 19 years from diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. Of the 37 patients who were treated successfully, or in whom at least partial suppression of the underlying HPFS was achieved, 17 (46%) showed amyloid regression, 14 (38%) showed a stable amyloid load, and 2 (5%) showed increased amyloid deposition over the followup period. CONCLUSION: AA amyloidosis remains a challenging and serious late complication of HPFS; however, outcomes are excellent when HPFS is diagnosed early enough to allow effective treatment, thus preventing or retarding further amyloid deposition and organ damage."

However, taxonomic assessment of the immature stages of most arthropods is challenging; characters for identification are often dependent on adult morphology and reproductive structures. This study aims to strengthen the identification of such specimens through DNA barcoding, with a focus on microlepidoptera. A sample of 241 primarily immature microlepidoptera specimens intercepted at U.S. ports-of-entry from 2007 to 2011 were selected for analysis. From this sample, 201 COI-5P sequences were generated and analyzed for concordance between morphology-based and DNA-based identifications. The retrospective analysis of the data over 10 years (2009 to 2019) using the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) system demonstrates the importance of establishing and growing DNA barcode reference libraries for use in specimen identification. Additionally, analysis of specimen identification using public data (43.3% specimens identified) vs. non-public data (78.6% specimens identified) highlights the need to encourage researchers to make data publicly accessible. DNA barcoding surpassed morphological identification with 42.3% (public) and 66.7% (non-public) of the sampled specimens achieving a species-level identification, compared to 38.3% species-level identification by morphology. Whilst DNA barcoding was not able to identify all specimens in our dataset, its incorporation into border security programs as an adjunct to morphological identification can provide secondary lines of evidence and lower taxonomic resolution in many cases. Furthermore, with increased globalization, database records need to be clearly annotated for suspected specimen origin versus interception location."

We tested the hypothesis that EEG background abnormalities in immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome correlate with clinical signs of neurotoxicity. In addition, we describe ictal and interictal EEG patterns to better understand the natural history of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome-associated seizures. METHODS:EEGs were obtained in 19 of 100 subjects in a prospective cohort study of children and young adults undergoing CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. We classified the EEG background on a severity scale of 0 to 5 during 30-minute epochs. EEG grades were compared with neurotoxicity scored by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium scores. Descriptive analysis was conducted for ictal and interictal EEG abnormalities. RESULTS:EEG background abnormality scores correlated well with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events neurotoxicity scores (P = 0.0022) and Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium scores (P = 0.0085). EEG was better able to differentiate the severity of coma patterns compared with the clinical scores. The EEG captured electroclinical seizures in 4 of 19 subjects, 3 of whom had additional electrographic-only seizures. Seizures most often arose from posterior head regions. Interictal epileptiform discharges were focal, multifocal, or lateralized periodic discharges. No seizures or interictal epileptiform abnormalities were seen in subjects without previous clinical seizures. CONCLUSIONS:Continuous EEG monitoring is high yield for seizure detection in high-risk chimeric antigen receptor T cell patients, and electrographic-only seizures are common.

MYLK, LMOD1, MYL9, and MYH11 encode for various proteins within smooth muscle cells; abnormalities within these proteins lead to abnormal intestinal smooth muscle contractions. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is defined by symptoms of bowel obstruction in the absence of a lumen-occluding lesion. CIPO is a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the enteric neurons, intestinal smooth muscle, and/or the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). Symptoms can be non-specific and etiologies include both primary and secondary causes of CIPO that contribute to the delay in recognizing this condition and making the correct diagnosis. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction has been recognized in both adults and children with fundamental differences in the etiology, symptom onset, clinical features and natural history of this disorder. For this reason, it has been considered a separate entity referred to as pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction (PIPO)."

It is defined as a pauci-immune necrotizing small vessel vasculitis, which usually affects the kidneys, followed by the lungs. It also presents systemic symptoms. The etiology of MPA is still unclear, but evidence reinforces the autoimmune mechanisms as the main etiopathogenic factor. Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is not an uncommon disease whose etiology varies according to geographical differences and the patient's age. The natural history of AS begins with a prolonged asymptomatic period, but when symptomatic, respiratory failure is one of its main clinical presentations. The authors present the case of a 55-year-old woman who was admitted with the diagnosis of renal failure, anemia, and a cardiac murmur. The patient had been recently diagnosed with pneumonia. During hospitalization, diagnostic workup disclosed a normal kidney size as well as parenchymal thickness. A renal biopsy was undertaken but the specimen was exiguous, showing 4 sclerotic glomeruli and 1 glomerulus with crescentic glomerulonephritis. The search for ANCA was positive. The investigation of the cardiac murmur disclosed AS. The patient, on hemodialysis, presented episodes of respiratory failure, which was interpreted as acute pulmonary edema, but a suspicion of ANCA-related pulmonary renal syndrome was raised. However, the aortic valve replacement was prioritized. While awaiting cardiac surgery, the patient died because of respiratory insufficiency. Autopsy findings concluded that MPA with pulmonary hemorrhage due to vasculitis was the immediate cause of death. Although AS was present at autopsy and classified as moderate/severe, this lesion was a bystander in the process of this patient's end of life, demonstrating the value of autopsy for medical learning and reasoning purposes."

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. METHODS: Review of GPA cases (identified by serology, biopsy, or clinical presentation) seen in the otolaryngology department of an academic medical center. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were identified; each patient was followed for an average 6.8 years. Sinusitis and subglottic stenosis were the most commonly observed head and neck manifestations at diagnosis, seen in 64% and 36%, respectively. Over time, disease spread to additional sites in more than half the cohort (n = 14), but only two of 13 patients with disease initially limited to the head and neck developed pulmonary disease, and none developed renal disease. Cumulatively, otitis media was more likely to be observed in patients with systemic disease (P = .04). Patients with localized (n = 12) and systemic (n = 12) GPA did not have significantly different rates of surgical interventions (0.55 vs. 0.72 surgical interventions/patient-year of follow-up, respectively, P = .19). CONCLUSIONS: GPA has a variety of head and neck manifestations, most commonly sinusitis, nasal disease, subglottic stenosis, and otitis media. GPA commonly progresses to involve additional sites, regardless of the extent of disease. These patients require frequent surgical intervention, and the clinician should remain vigilant for progression of disease."

RECENT FINDINGS: The term polyarteritis nodosa has been used for more than 100 years as a diagnostic term for patients with systemic vasculitis; however, specific vasculitides have been singled out like branches being chopped off a tree. Now, so little is left of the trunk of that tree that it is questionable to what extent we can trust older literature with respect to clinical features, natural history and response to treatment. Many authors of case reports, as well as authors of reviews and book chapters, claim they adhere to the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference definition of polyarteritis nodosa, yet still cite almost exclusively studies using older definitions without highlighting this dilemma. In the past year, two proposals affecting classification have been published: one stating that cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa and hepatitis-associated polyarteritis nodosa are diseases distinct from classical polyarteritis nodosa, and one providing an algorithm to separate microscopic polyangiitis from classical polyarteritis nodosa. SUMMARY: There is hope that a wide acceptance of the new classification principles will lead to a more uniform way to diagnose classical polyarteritis nodosa, which will facilitate clinical studies and eventually improve management."

Treatment affects the tissue reaction. The microscopic recognition of partially treated disease is important, as the absence of expected lesions may lead to nonspecific diagnoses and inappropriate management. The appearance of treated disease over time may offer insight into its histogenesis and natural history. We correlated clinical features and pulmonary histology in 20 patients with WG after they had been treated with corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide or both. All patients had inflammatory or fibrotic pulmonary disease resulting from WG, but only 4 (20%) had macronodular necrosis typical of WG. Serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was elevated in all patients in whom it was measured. We divided the pathological findings into (1) vasculitis, (2) extravascular necrosis, (3) bronchiolitis, and (4) other lesions, and further divided them into (a) diagnostic for active disease, (b) suspicious for active disease, (c) suspicious for healing disease, (d) suspicious for residual disease, and (e) possible disease. Diagnostic or suspicious vascular lesions occurred in 15 patients (75%) and included granulomatous vasculitis, capillaritis or suspicious capillaritis, and neutrophilic vasculitis. Diagnostic or suspicious extravascular lesions occurred in 12 patients (60%) and included palisading granuloma, microabscess, macronodular pathergic necrosis, giant cell nodules, and micronodular scars. The giant cell nodules and nodular scars were an unusual healing pattern of palisading granulomas. Diagnostic bronchiolar lesions occurred in 1 patient (6%) and suspicious lesions in 13 patients (65%), including three novel patterns of bronchiolitis fibrosa (BF): (1) BF with giant cells, (2) BF with hemosiderin, and (3) BF with micronodular scars. Other features related to WG included diffuse alveolar damage, peculiar alveolar fibrin, interstitial fibrosis, pneumonitis resembling usual interstitial pneumonitis, and lipoid pneumonia. Classic necrotic nodules and vasculitis of WG should not be anticipated after therapy, but the diagnosis of pulmonary WG after treatment may be made if the effects of treatment on histology are considered. Changes in anticipated histology are found after therapy as short as 6 days. The histology typically has muted features. BF develops in most patients and may reflect a salutary effect of therapy. Palisading granuloma may convert to giant cell nodule or micronodular scar. Interstitial fibrosis is common, and pneumonitis resembling usual interstitial pneumonitis can develop. If only healing or residual disease is encountered, one should search further clinically and pathologically for active disease. Dampened inflammatory lesions represent smoldering disease that presumably needs additional therapy. Scarring presumably represents successfully treated but permanent disease."

The musculature, a common site of infection, provides access to biochemical (carbohydrate-rich) and physiological (mitochondria-rich) conditions conducive to prolific parasite replication and maturation. The significant proportion of body plan devoted to skeletal musculature in Crustacea provides the location for a highly efficient intracellular parasite factory. In this study, we utilize histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic evidence to describe a previously known (Inodosporus octospora) and novel (Ovipleistophora arlo n. sp.) microsporidian parasites infecting the musculature of the common prawn (Palaemon serratus) from the same site, at the same time of year. Despite similar clinical signs of infection, both parasites are otherwise distinct in terms of pathogenesis, morphology and phylogeny. Based upon partial subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rDNA) sequence, we show that that I. octospora may be identical to a Kabatana sp. previously described infecting two-spot goby (Gobiusculus flavescens) in Europe, or at least that Inodosporus and Kabatana genera are synonyms. In addition, SSU rDNA sequence for O. arlo places it within a distinct clade containing Ovipleistophora mirandellae and Ovipleistophora ovariae, both infecting the oocytes of freshwater fish in Europe. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for trophic-transfer between crustacean and fish hosts for two different microsporidians within clade 5 of the phylum. Furthermore, it demonstrates that morphologically and phylogenetically distinct microsporidians can infect the same tissues of the same host species to impart clinical signs which mimic infection with the other."

Mixed infections of the two species occur, and little is known about the interactions among the host and the two pathogens that have allowed N. ceranae to become dominant in most geographical areas.

We found similar rates of infection (percentage of bees with active infections after inoculation) for both species in mixed infections, with N. apis having a slightly higher rate (91% compared to 86% for N. ceranae). We observed slightly higher spore counts in bees infected with N. ceranae than in bees infected with N. apis in single microsporidia infections, especially at the midpoint of infection (day 10). Bees with mixed infections of both species had higher spore counts than bees with single infections, but spore counts in mixed infections were highly variable. We did not see a competitive advantage for N. ceranae in mixed infections; N. apis spore counts were either higher or counts were similar for both species and more N. apis spores were produced in 62% of bees inoculated with equal dosages of the two microsporidian species. N. ceranae does not, therefore, appear to have a strong within-host advantage for either infectivity or spore growth, suggesting that direct competition in these worker bee mid-guts is not responsible for its apparent replacement of N. apis."

RECENT FINDINGS:MELAS is associated with endothelial dysfunction by decreased plasma L-arginine, nitric oxide (NO), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Endothelial dysfunction is also evident using flow-mediated vasodilation measurement by high-resolution Doppler echocardiography in the forearm artery in patients with MELAS. L-arginine is known to be an important precursor of NO to normalize the endothelial function in MELAS. In our clinical trial followed by 7 years follow-up study, the systematic administration of L-arginine to patients with MELAS significantly improved the survival curve of patients compared with natural history. Maintaining plasma arginine concentration at least 168 μmol/l may prevent the ictuses through the putative pathophysiologic mechanism and optimal normalization of endothelial dysfunction.

Results:We identified echocardiogram and ECG as the principal screening modalities that identify cardiac structural (29%) and conduction abnormalities (39%) in various MM syndromes. ECG abnormalities were more prevalent in patients with m.3243A>G mutations than other gene defects, and patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) had a higher prevalence of ECG abnormalities than patients with other clinical syndromes.

METHODS:1847 consecutive patients with severe AS (aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2 and aortic valve systolic mean Doppler gradient ≥40 mm Hg or peak velocity ≥4 m/s) and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50% were identified. The independent association of AF and all-cause mortality was assessed. RESULTS:Age was 76±11 years and 46% were female; 293 (16%) patients had AF and 1554 (84%) had SR. In AF, 72% were symptomatic versus 71% in SR. Survival rate at 5 years for AF (41%) was lower than SR (65%) (age- and sex-adjusted HR=1.66 (1.40-1.98), p<0.0001). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with mortality included age (HR per 10 years=1.55 (1.42-1.69), p<0.0001), dyspnoea (HR=1.58 (1.33-1.87), p<0.0001), ≥ moderate mitral regurgitation (HR=1.63 (1.22-2.18), p=0.001), right ventricular systolic dysfunction (HR=1.88 (1.52-2.33), p<0.0001), left atrial volume index (HR per 10 mL/m2=1.13 (1.07-1.19), p<0.0001) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) (HR=0.44 (0.38-0.52), p<0.0001). AF was not a predictor of mortality independent of variables strongly correlated HR=1.02 (0.84-1.25), p=0.81). The 1-year probability of AVR following diagnosis of severe AS was lower in AF (49.8%) than SR (62.5%) (HR=0.73 (0.62-0.86), p<0.001); among patients with AF not referred for AVR, symptoms were frequently attributed to AF instead of AS. CONCLUSION:AF was associated with poor prognosis in patients with severe AS, but apparent differences in outcomes compared with SR were explained by factors other than AF including concomitant cardiac abnormalities and deferral of AVR due to attribution of cardiac symptoms to AF."
1344,GARD:0003685,Mitral atresia,30725821,['Review'],Aortic Valve Replacement,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30725821,"The aortic valve is a semilunar valve with three leaflets, which lies at the junction of left ventricle and aorta. It allows unidirectional blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. Because of the highly complex and sophisticated cellular and molecular functions, the thin valve leaflet can withstand extreme mechanical and hemodynamic forces with every cardiac cycle.[1] Various factors including age and congenital defects can compromise the normal valvular function leading to a wide variety of complications.[2] Although bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are the most common congenital abnormality, congenital valve defects can range from aortic atresia (missing or incomplete closure of aortic valves) to a sub or supra-valvular stenosis. BAV is reported to have an incidence of 1 to 2% with a male predominance. Lack of microfibrillar proteins during valvulogenesis has been reported to affect the leaflet development where two leaflets are fused to form one large leaflet. It frequently correlates with aortic abnormalities such as aortic dilation (root, ascending and arch) and coarctation of the aorta.[3] The bicuspid aortic valve leaflets can undergo accelerated calcific degeneration because of abnormal hemodynamic forces. Congenital abnormalities including BAV can lead to various valvular complications including aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation leading to an increased risk to infective endocarditis, which has a reported incidence of 12 to 39% in BAV.[3] Unless severe, BAV generally remains asymptomatic till the age of 50 to 60 years. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a narrowing of the valve aperture reducing the aortic valve area. Increased resistance to blood flow and transvalvular pressure gradient causes increased left ventricle workload causing hypertrophy. Its prevalence increases with age and can be as high as 4.6% in people greater than age 75 years. Being the most common valvular disease in Europe and America, estimates are that 3.5 million people in England alone will have AS by the year 2020.[4] Calcific degeneration leading to stiffening and restriction motion of valve leaflet is the most common cause of AS. Disruption of endothelium lining on the aortic side caused by increased mechanical stress seem to be the inciting event. Posterior leaflets are reported to be affected the most.[5] Rheumatic fever causing inflammation of the leaflets is still the leading cause of AS in developing countries. AS can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms of syncope, angina and heart failure.[6] Severe AS is fatal with a 50% mortality at 2 years.[7] As per The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, AS is graded severe when the orifice area is less than 1.0 cm, the mean gradient is greater than 40 mmHg or the jet velocity is greater than 4 m/s. Prognosis is poor in symptomatic or severe cases unless the valve is replaced. Up to 30% of patients aged > 75 do not undergo surgical valve replacement either because of technical reasons; this may include porcelain aorta, general frailty, refusal to undergo surgery, and serious comorbid conditions.[8] The operative death risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is as high as 10% in patients with LV dysfunction, chronic renal disease, and advanced age.[9] Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR/TAVI) have emerged as a more feasible and less risky option for patients not suitable for surgery. Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle when the valve leaflets fail to coapt. Common causes include congenital defects, calcific degeneration, infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever, and trauma.[10][11][12][13] Ventricular hypertrophy in chronic cases accommodates increased volume to maintain the normal stroke volume and end-diastolic pressure; hence, chronic AR can be asymptomatic for decades.[14] In contrast, with acute cases of AR, ventricles do not have enough time to undergo the needed changes such as hypertrophy to accommodate increased volumes. Because of decreased stroke volume, the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output but is insufficient to meet the demand resulting in increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. On physical examination, AR murmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after the aortic component of S (A); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal intercostal space. It also has associations with various other murmurs including: “Mid-systolic murmur” because of rapid ejection of an overload of blood from the left ventricle, “Austin Flint” murmur is mid-to-late diastolic murmur due to partial closure of mitral valve during ventricular systole because of regurgitant flow from aortic valve, “Cole-Cecil” is a diastolic murmur due to the fusion of an aortic murmur with the S3 because of simultaneous filling of the left ventricle from left atrium and AR. History of valvular surgery Dr. Theodore Tuffier, in 1912, used his finger to free the fused leaflets of a stenosed aortic valve.[15] Before the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mitral valve repair involved commissurotomy through access from the left atrial chamber. Thomas Homes Sellors performed first pulmonary valvulotomy in 1948 by using a tenotomy knife.[16] Charles Hufnagel developed the first artificial valve based on a reciprocating ball and cage. It was used to prevent backflow of blood into the ventricles due to aortic insufficiency.[17] CPB machine revolutionized the valve replacement in the anatomical position. Dr. Dwight Harken and his colleagues performed the first successful aortic valve replacement. Later that year, Drs. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards performed mitral valve replacement.[18] Bioprosthetic valves are closer in function to natural valves but have a limited life expectancy, whereas, Mechanical valves are more durable but require anticoagulation. The choice of valves, among other factors, depends upon the patient’s age and well-being. Mechanical heart valves are known to last for approximately 25 years. Seventy different mechanical heart valves have been developed since 1960.[19] Ball and cage, bi-leaflet, and tilting disc are the common ones. Modification of the ball valve by Dr. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards entailed developing a cage made of lucite with a silicone elastomer ball. The cage material was later changed to stainless steel and then cobalt-chromium alloys. The Starr-Edward valve also has a Teflon sewing ring, which enabled suturing into mitral and later into the aortic position.[20]  Increased thrombogenicity has been a significant issue, for which valves underwent several modifications such as measures to reduce metal contact by covering the struts with cloth and using Silastic shields. Other issues included hemolysis due to excessive rubbing of the ball against the sewing ring and occlusion of coronary ostia because of high profile. Despite these issues, these valves showed the feasibility of prosthetic valve enabling Starr-Edwards to draw design criteria. Basic points included that the valves should be chemically inert, biocompatible, a-traumatic to blood, and non-thrombogenic.[21]  In 1965, Kay-Shiley’s non-rotating disc valve replaced the ball with a single disc but demonstrated poor hemodynamics and hemolysis and was discontinued. Bjork-Shiley in 1969 developed a tilting-disc valve, which overcame the problems with the single-disc valve. Free rotation of disc between metal struts allows it to open by tilting at a 60-degree angle. Bjork-Shiley replaced the flat with the convexo-concave disc to create a larger orifice in 1975 but were the object of a recall due to fracture of welded struts.[22]  Medtronic Hall valve developed by Dr. Karl Hall and Robert Kaster is the most common tilting disc valve. Perforation in the middle of the disc served as a guide and an improved tilting angle.[23] In 1977, St Jude Medical developed Bi-leaflet valve, which comprised two semi-circular flaps with hinges close to the center of the orifice. Stagnation of blood flow leading to thrombus formation around the hinge region was a problem with the bi-leaflet valve.[15] A newly developed valve resolved this issue with a valve in which the continuous 360-degree rotation around the central axis of the valve ensured an even distribution of blood flow and prevent thrombus formation.[16]  Predisposition for thrombosis, embolism, need for lifelong anticoagulation therapy are drawbacks of mechanical valves. Bioprosthetic valves can either be an allograft (cadaver or Ross procedure) or, a xenograft (native or pericardium). The Ross procedure involves replacing the diseased aortic valve with the patient’s own pulmonary valve (autograft) and replace the pulmonary valve with aortic or pulmonary allograft. The pulmonary autograft grows with the patient and does not induce an immunologic response. The most common xenografts are porcine aortic valves and bovine pericardial valves. Lonescu-Shiley developed xenograft valves by using bovine pericardium on a titanium stent in 1971 but was later withdrawn in 1987 due to structural failure including abrasive tears because of fabric-tissue interface and leaflet calcification. Carpentier-Edwards bovine pericardial valve overcame those issues by making some structural modifications, like stitching pericardium to the inside of the fabric and using flexible stent posts. Although biological valves have better hemodynamics compared to mechanical valves, they have a shorter lifespan because of calcification, which stiffens the valve leaflets. Tissues engineering, a field in regenerative medicine restores and maintains the function of living tissues. Skin graft for burn victims is an example. Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) are perceived to be non-thrombogenic, and infection resistant. With advancement in material science and culturing techniques, there is the possibility of a TEHV valve that is capable of growing, remodeling and repairing itself as the patients grow. Polymeric valves have been around for over 50 years, but because the earlier versions were prone to calcification and degradation, they were not widely used and instead only used in bridge devices like artificial hearts and left ventricular assist devices. Besides the advantage that they can be produced in various shapes and sizes,[17] they are known to combine the durability of mechanical valves and the hydrodynamic function of bioprosthetic valves.[18] The earliest polymeric valve implanted in a 44-year-old female in 1958 at the mitral position was a polyurethane design with Teflon chordae tendinae.[18][24] Polyurethane valves have been found to have better hemodynamics compared to bioprosthetic valves and a lower incidence of thrombogenicity than mechanical valves. With advances in material sciences, the future of polymeric valves seems promising."

On the contrary, a bicuspid aortic valve can also occur with normal function throughout life and never need treatment. Numerous genetic mechanisms are involved in the abnormal cellular functions that may cause abnormal development of the aortic valve during early foetal life. As several chromosomal disorders are also associated with a bicuspid valve, there does not appear to be an apparent common trigger to the abnormal development of the aortic valve. The clinical care of the bicuspid aortic valve patient has been changed by a significant body of evidence that has improved the understanding of the natural history of the disease, including when to best intervene with valve replacement and when to provide prophylactic aortic root surgery. Moreover, as bicuspid valve disease is also part of various syndromes, we can identify high-risk patients in whom a bicuspid valve is much more unfavourable than in the normal population. This review provides an overview of all aspects of the bicuspid aortic valve condition and gives an updated perspective on issues from pathophysiology to clinical care of bicuspid aortic valve disease and associated aortic disease in asymptomatic, symptomatic, and pregnant patients, as well as our viewpoint on population screening."

MPS I and II patients often develop cardiac involvement leading to early mortality, however there are limited data in MPS III. The objective of this study is to describe cardiac abnormalities in a large group of MPS III patients followed in a longitudinal natural history study designed to determine outcome measures for gene transfer trials. METHODS:A single center study of MPS III patients who were enrolled in the Nationwide Children's Hospital natural history study in 2014. Two cardiologists reviewed all patient echocardiograms for anatomic, valvular, and functional abnormalities. Valve abnormalities were defined as abnormal morphology, trivial mitral regurgitation (MR) with abnormal morphology or at least mild MR, and any aortic regurgitation (AR). Abnormal left ventricular (LV) function was defined as ejection fraction < 50%. Group comparisons were assessed using two-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. RESULTS:Twenty-five patients, 15 Type A and 10 Type B MPS III, underwent 45 echocardiograms. Fifteen patients (60%) demonstrated an abnormal echocardiographic finding with age at first abnormal echocardiogram within the study being 6.8 ± 2.8 years. Left-sided valve abnormalities were common over time: 7 mitral valve thickening, 2 mitral valve prolapse, 16 MR (8 mild, 8 trivial), 3 aortic valve thickening, and 9 AR (7 mild, 2 trivial). Two patients had asymmetric LV septal hypertrophy. No valvular stenosis or ventricular function abnormalities were noted. Incidental findings included: mild aortic root dilation (2), bicommissural aortic valve (1), and mild tricuspid regurgitation (3). CONCLUSIONS:Individuals with Sanfilippo A and B demonstrate a natural history of cardiac involvement with valvular abnormalities most common. In short-term follow up, patients demonstrated only mild progression of abnormalities, none requiring intervention. Valvular disease prevalence is similar to MPS I and II, but appears less severe. These findings raise no specific concerns for gene transfer trials in patients in this age range."

In this review, we describe the natural history, radiological features, proposed pathogenesis, and management options for this debilitating condition. RECENT FINDINGS:Since its first description in 1922, about 400 cases of melorheostosis have been reported, either as single reports or in small case series. Melorheostosis affects the appendicular skeleton more commonly than the axial skeleton and usually presents with lower limb deformity. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and radiological features that help differentiate this condition from other sclerosing bone dysplasias. LEM domain-containing protein 3 (LEMD3) gene mutations have been demonstrated in several familial cases, but these have been more strongly correlated with other hereditary dysplasias, such as osteopoikilosis, and are not thought to be the causative gene for melorheostosis. The exact etiology of classic sporadically occurring melorheostosis remains unknown, with possible causes being somatic LEMD3 mutations, somatic mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein/transforming growth factor-beta pathway, mutations in multiple genes, or other non-genetic causes. Management in recent years has involved nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates in addition to traditional orthopedic surgical approaches and physical therapy. Melorheostosis may present as mixed or atypical osseous involvement in addition to the classically described ""dripping candle wax"" appearance of hyperostosis. Some patients may have overlap with osteopoikilosis or Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome. In the future, better characterization of genetic and developmental factors predisposing to melorheostosis may lead to the development of targeted therapy for this condition, as well as for more commonly encountered skeletal abnormalities."

The purposes of this study were: to identify any patients followed in a large Turkish cohort as T1D, with an atypical natural history, who may in fact have MODY, and to define the criteria which would indicate patients with likely MODY as early as possible after presentation to allow prompt genetic testing. METHODS:Urinary C-peptide/creatinine ratio (UCPCR) was studied in 152 patients having a diagnosis of T1D for at least 3 years. Those with a UCPCR ≥0.2 nmol/mmol were selected for genetic analysis of the Glucokinase (GCK), Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a (HNF1A), Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (HNF4A), and Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b (HNF1B) genes. This UCPCR cut-off was used because of the reported high sensitivity and specificity. Cases were also evaluated using a MODY probability calculator. RESULTS:Twenty-three patients from 152 participants (15.1%) had a UCPCR indicating persistent insulin reserve. The mean age ± SD of the patients was 13.6 ± 3.6 years (range 8.30-21.6). Of these 23, two (8.7%) were found to have a mutation, one with HNF4A and one with HNF1B mutation. No mutations were detected in the GCK or HNF1A genes. CONCLUSION:In Turkish children with a diagnosis of T1D but who have persistent insulin reserve 3 years after diagnosis, up to 9% may have a genetic mutation indicating a diagnosis of MODY."

To date, no microbiome studies have been performed in maturity-onset diabetes of the young 2 (MODY2), a monogenic cause of diabetes. Gut microbiota of type 1 diabetes, MODY2, and healthy control subjects was compared. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:This was a case-control study in 15 children with type 1 diabetes, 15 children with MODY2, and 13 healthy children. Metabolic control and potential factors modifying gut microbiota were controlled. Microbiome composition was determined by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. RESULTS:Compared with healthy control subjects, type 1 diabetes was associated with a significantly lower microbiota diversity, a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Veillonella, Blautia, and Streptococcus genera, and a lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospira. Children with MODY2 showed a significantly higher Prevotella abundance and a lower Ruminococcus and Bacteroides abundance. Proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharides were increased in type 1 diabetes, and gut permeability (determined by zonulin levels) was significantly increased in type 1 diabetes and MODY2. The PICRUSt analysis found an increment of genes related to lipid and amino acid metabolism, ABC transport, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, antigen processing and presentation, and chemokine signaling pathways in type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS:Gut microbiota in type 1 diabetes differs at taxonomic and functional levels not only in comparison with healthy subjects but fundamentally with regard to a model of nonautoimmune diabetes. Future longitudinal studies should be aimed at evaluating if the modulation of gut microbiota in patients with a high risk of type 1 diabetes could modify the natural history of this autoimmune disease."
