These four patients, as well as those previously reported, all had absent hair, brows, and lashes, absent or short eyelids, macrostomia, ear anomalies, redundant skin, and abnormal genitalia. Many have persistent visual problems, often related to early corneal exposure. Hearing loss, poor hair growth, finger contractures, and growth retardation were also chronic problems. Developmental impairment was present in two-thirds of patients but was usually mild. This report contributes to our knowledge regarding the natural history of AMS and includes the first report of an adult patient. It also adds further evidence that AMS is distinct from Barber-Say syndrome, which has similar features.",

Diarrhea started in infancy in the two brothers and from the age of 13 in the sister. During the second decade of life, central nervous system symptoms became prominent, with fatigue and disturbance in gait and balance. Night blindness developed at a later phase of the disease in the brothers, whereas cavus developed in both legs in the sister. Apolipoprotein B was absent in all patients, and each had more than 50% of acanthocytes present on peripheral smear. The diagnosis of A-beta-lipoproteinemia was established on the basis of small bowel histology and serum lipid estimations. Family studies revealed normal lipid profiles in all healthy members. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) pattern in the two most severely affected patients was identical. The only detectable difference between the severely ill patients and other members of the family, however, was homozygosity for the HLA B18 antigen, whereas the third patient had no alleles for the HLA B18 antigen. Treatment consisted of a low-fat diet and high doses of vitamins A and E. A modified diet substituting medium-chain triglycerides for dietary fat was also given, with significant improvement in the nutritional status of patients but not in symptoms related to advanced disease, such as retinal and cardiac manifestations. We conclude that the course of the disease in untreated patients is characterized by continuous symptoms. Some of the symptoms, however, especially those related to malabsorption, as well as some anthropometric parameters can be improved by the application of a modified diet including medium-chain triglycerides. We suggest the routine measurement of plasma lipids and apoproteins not only in children with failure to thrive, with unexplained malabsorption, or with neurologic symptoms, but also in adults with chronic diarrhea accompanied by neurologic symptoms or clinical and laboratory signs of malabsorption.",

Geleophysic dysplasia is an acromelic dysplasia that is associated with characteristic facial features, progressive cardiac valvular thickening, and tracheal stenosis. Owing to overlapping clinical features with other types of short-limbed skeletal dysplasias, it is important to make a precise diagnosis as they have different cardiac morbidity and mortality. We present the cases of three patients with geleophysic dysplasia and progressive mitral valve disease to emphasise the natural history of this disorder and provide guidance regarding cardiac health supervision in these individuals.",

Some non-motor symptoms such as hyposmia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and constipation may develop during the prodromal stage of PD and precede PD diagnosis by years. OBJECTIVES:We examined the promise and pitfalls of research on premotor symptoms of PD and developed priorities and strategies to understand their clinical and etiological implications. METHODS:This review was based on a workshop, Parkinson's Disease Premotor Symptom Symposium, held 7-8 June 2012 at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. DISCUSSION:Research on premotor symptoms of PD may offer an excellent opportunity to characterize high-risk populations and to better understand PD etiology. Such research may lead to evaluation of novel etiological hypotheses such as the possibility that environmental toxicants or viruses may initiate PD pathogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract or olfactory bulb. At present, our understanding of premotor symptoms of PD is in its infancy and faces many obstacles. These symptoms are often not specific to PD and have low positive predictive value for early PD diagnosis. Further, the pathological bases and biological mechanisms of these premotor symptoms and their relevance to PD pathogenesis are poorly understood. CONCLUSION:This is an emerging research area with important data gaps to be filled. Future research is needed to understand the prevalence of multiple premotor symptoms and their etiological relevance to PD. Animal experiments and mechanistic studies will further understanding of the biology of these premotor symptoms and test novel etiological hypothesis.",
5,GARD:0000008,Agnosia,17028557,"['Review', 'Journal Article', 'English Abstract']",[From physiopathology to treatment of Alzheimer's disease].,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17028557,"The natural and molecular history of familial or sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows that APP (amyloid protein precursor) dysfunction is a consensual central etiological factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is demonstrated by 1) genetic defects involving APP gene or APP dysfunction (such as PS1 or PS2), leading to the formation of neocortical amyloid plaques in familial AD; 2) transgenic mice with these mutated genes that develop plaques; 3) both sporadic and familial AD develop plaques. But two alternatives to explain the physiopathology can be proposed: a gain of toxic function of AB peptide (reflected by the amyloid cascade hypothesis) or a loss of function of APP, a ubiquitous and well conserved protein with numerous possible neurotrophic activities. On the other hand, AD is also characterized by another inescapable degenerating process: tauopathy, an intraneuronal aggregation of tau proteins into neurofibrillary tangles. Remarkably enough, progression of tauopathy in neocortical areas fully explains the progressive clinical deficits of AD, from memory loss to aphasia, apraxia, agnosia. Also one has to bare in mind that most demented patients and most dementing neurodegenerative disorders have a tauopathy. From that, it is concluded that APP an Tau are solid therapeutic targets. But if we know that APP and Tau dysfunctions interact to boost neurodegeneration in AD, we still do no know what are the intraneuronal signaling pathways to activate or to inhibit to stop the degenerating process. There are many hypotheses and many possible approaches: the inhibition of toxicity of plaque, of AB protofibrils, or of AB oligomers inside or outside the neuron, using vaccination or ligands (Alzhemed). On the other hand, modulation of secretases that cleave APP by inhibiting those involved in the amyloidogenic pathway or by stimulating those of the non-amyloidogenic pathway, is a major route of research. Also modulation of kinases or phosphatases possibly involved in the aggregation of tau is also investigated. Because animal models are not perfectly relevant, at the end of the long and costly pathway of drug discovery, therapeutic trials are the only way to test these different hypotheses.",

The prevalence of this age related disabling illness is increasing. During the course of the disease, the clinical diagnosis will be that of ""possible Alzheimer's disease"", then ""probable Alzheimer's disease"". But the diagnosis of ""definite Alzheimer's disease"" requires a post-mortem brain examination and the demonstration of numerous senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in hippocampal and association cortical areas. The neuropathological examination confirms probable Alzheimer's disease clinical diagnosis in 85% of the cases examined in medical schools. However, with much more than 15% errors, the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease must be improved since it is a key factor for the therapeutic approach, and more especially for the efficiency of drug trials. At the present time, there are new leads for a biological diagnosis in the blood or the CSF. However, the natural (and molecular) history of Alzheimer's disease points out that all biochemical dysfunctions remain in the CNS, and more particularly in association brain areas. This is demonstrated using reliable biochemical markers such as A beta and pathological Tau proteins, which are the basic components of amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively. Also, a genetic diagnosis can be performed in half of familial autosomic dominant Alzheimer's disease, which represents less than 1% of all Alzheimer's disease cases. Together, this shows that there is a lack of reliable Alzheimer's disease markers. The search for new specific markers (clinical, epidemiological, genetic, biochemical, biological) must go on.",

Characterization of the evolution and outcome into adulthood has not been sufficiently investigated. The goal of this study was to elucidate the natural history of alternating hemiplegia within a large cohort of 157 patients, as part of the European Network for Research on Alternating Hemiplegia project. A questionnaire was formulated to determine the severity of both paroxysmal and global neurological impairment and address progression of the disorder by allocating data to specific age epochs up to and over 24 years of age. Patients in early age groups were consistently present in subsequent later age groups and for each patient, data were collected for each corresponding age epoch. The study was based on predominantly retrospective and, for a period of 2 years, prospective data. At inclusion, patients were aged from 9 months to 52 years. The median age at diagnosis was 20 months. All patients experienced hemiplegic attacks; 86.5% reported episodes of bilateral weakness, 88% dystonic attacks, 53% epileptic seizures, 72% developed chorea and/or dystonia and 92% mental retardation. When data over the course of the illness were examined for the whole cohort, the severity of symptoms did not appear to change, with the exception of abnormal ocular movements and hypotonia that regressed, but did not disappear into adulthood (from 86 to 36% and 76 to 36%, respectively). No statistically significant correlation between a history of severe paroxysmal hemiplegic/dystonic episodes and a worse neurological outcome was identified. Seven patients died, some of whom experienced severe plegic attacks or epileptic seizures at the time of death. History of severe plegic/dystonic attacks was not found to be an aggravating factor for deceased patients. Our results provide evidence that the natural history of alternating hemiplegia is highly variable and unpredictable for individual patients. However, we did not find evidence to support a steadily progressive and degenerative course of the disorder when patients were analysed as a group. For a minority of patients, a risk of sudden death was associated with more severe neurological impairment. The European Network for Research on Alternating Hemiplegia Registry, validated by our study, includes all major neurological signs and symptoms of alternating hemiplegia and may thus be used as a precedent for the progressive inclusion and follow-up of patients as well as a reference for genetic studies and treatment trials.",

The aim of this cross-sectional sub-study was to describe the baseline characteristics, risk factors, and comorbidities of patients enrolled in CARE-PF to date. METHODS:Patients completed study questionnaires and clinical measurements at enrollment and each follow-up visit. Environmental exposures were assessed by patient self-report and comorbidities by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Baseline characteristics, exposures, and comorbidities were described for the overall study population and for incident cases, and were compared across ILD subtypes. RESULTS:The full cohort included 1285 patients with ILD (961 incident cases (74.8%)). Diagnoses included connective tissue disease-associated ILD (33.3%), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (24.7%), unclassifiable ILD (22.3%), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) (7.5%), sarcoidosis (3.2%), non-IPF idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (3.0%, including idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) in 0.9%), and other ILDs (6.0%). Patient-reported exposures were most frequent amongst chronic HP, but common across all ILD subtypes. The CCI was ≤2 in 81% of patients, with a narrow distribution and range of values. CONCLUSIONS:CTD-ILD, IPF, and unclassifiable ILD made up 80% of ILD diagnoses at ILD referral centers in Canada, while idiopathic NSIP was rare when adhering to recommended diagnostic criteria. CCI had a very narrow distribution across our cohort suggesting it may be a poor discriminator in assessing the impact of comorbidities on patients with ILD.",

Although the frequency of M-pneu has been reported to range between 0.3 and 11.6%, more recent studies and meta-analyses have challenged that, suggesting that it is less common than previously thought. M-pneu is considered a hypersensitivity reaction usually occuring early after MTX commencement, and to be dose-independent. Furthermore, it does not seem to be truly related to the development of interstitial lung disease observed in some patients as part of the natural history of RA (RA-ILD). On the other hand, there are data suggesting that clinicians should be cautious when commencing MTX in patients with pre-existing lung disease. However, treatment should not be delayed or limited in progressive RA that could lead to RA-ILD, and MTX remains one of the central players in the treat-to-target approach. In this review, we aimed to summarize the current evidence from observational studies and clinical trials on lung disease in MTX-treated RA patients.

Irrespective of the clinical diagnosis, these progressive fibrosing ILDs show commonalities in the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms that drive a self-sustaining process of pulmonary fibrosis. The natural history of progressive fibrosing ILDs is characterized by decline in lung function, worsening of symptoms and health-related quality of life, and early mortality. Greater impairment in forced vital capacity or diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide, and a greater extent of fibrotic changes on a computed tomography scan, are predictors of mortality in patients with fibrosing ILDs. However, the course of these diseases is heterogenous and cannot accurately be predicted for an individual patient.

Among the most common and deadly ILDs are idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP). As the name implies, the cause of IPF remains elusive, but a variety of genetic and infectious risk factors have been identified. CHP results from chronic inhalation of an organic antigen, usually of avian or mold origin, and may occur in patients with a genetic predisposition. While IPF is treated with anti-fibrotic compounds, CHP is generally treated by suppression of the immune system and elimination of the causative antigen. Despite advances in our understanding of IPF and CHP, there exists substantial variability in the diagnosis and treatment of these disease processes. Furthermore, IPF and CHP natural history and treatment response remain far from uniform, leaving it unclear which patients derive the most benefit from disease-specific therapy. While clinical prediction models have improved our understanding of outcome risk in patients with various forms of ILD, recent advances in genomic technology provides a valuable opportunity to begin understanding the basis for outcome variability. Such advances will ultimately allow for the incorporation of genomic markers into risk stratification and clinical decision-making. In this piece, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the genomic factors that influence susceptibility and outcome risk among patients with IPF and CHP. Genomic modalities used to identify these genomic markers include genome-wide association studies, analyses of gene expression, drug-gene interaction testing, telomere length determination, telomerase mutation analysis, and studies of the lung microbiome. We then identify gaps in knowledge that should be addressed to help facilitate the incorporation of these genomic technologies into ILD clinical practice.",

Most of these remain asymptomatic with surgical intervention being reserved for those cysts causing symptoms from mass effect or hydrocephalus. It is not properly understood why cysts enlarge nor is it possible to predict in which cysts this will occur. The aim of this study is to review the natural history of incidental arachnoid cysts. METHODS:A retrospective case review was conducted of all patients diagnosed with an arachnoid cyst between 2007 and 2016. Case notes and radiology reports were reviewed for demographics, symptoms, and changes in cyst sizes. RESULTS:Four hundred and eighty-five patients were diagnosed with an arachnoid cyst during this time period; of these, 425 (87.6%) were asymptomatic. Patients with symptomatic cysts were significantly younger and more likely to have associated hydrocephalus. The most common indications for imaging which resulted in the diagnosis of the cyst were headaches (n = 106), stroke (n = 51), and seizures (n = 41). The cyst size remained stable or reduced in 147 patients (99.3%) with follow-up imaging (n = 148), and the enlarging cyst remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS:Asymptomatic arachnoid cysts have a low rate of cyst enlargement on follow-up imaging, which supports not routinely imaging these patients. However, serial imaging and surgery may still be indicated in asymptomatic patients at risk of obstructive hydrocephalus which, in this series, was only seen in the pediatric population.

Most ACs may persist and remain asymptomatic throughout life and not require treatment. However, there have been some case reports of ACs that have become larger or smaller over time and, in rare cases, have even spontaneously resolved. It is the authors' practice to recommend serial neuroimaging in patients with asymptomatic sylvian ACs and not offer surgery to patients without symptoms, even in those with a relatively large cyst. CASE REPORT:The present article describes a case involving a 6-year-old boy with a large, asymptomatic AC in the left Sylvian fissure involving the temporo-frontal region, which resolved spontaneously during the 2-year follow-up period after initial diagnosis without any surgical intervention. Currently, at the 7-year follow-up, the patient has remained neurologically intact, attends school, and is symptom-free.

Even though the risk of hemorrhage in patients with AC is very low, the presence of AC is a known risk factor for SDH. Fortunately, the clinical outcome of patients who present with hemorrhage associated with AC is generally favorable with early recognition and prompt surgical treatment.

METHODS:This study retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who underwent lung transplant at a single center, Norton Thoracic Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2016. Pretransplant esophagram, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 24-hour pH monitoring, high-resolution manometry, and gastric emptying studies were analyzed. RESULTS:Of the 466 patients who underwent lung transplant during the study period, 54 (11.59%) had BE on pretransplant esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Of these, 1 patient had HGD before lung transplant. The median age of patients was 64 years (interquartile range, 58.25 to 68.75 years); 66.7% were men. Median follow-up duration was 29.48 months (interquartile range, 19.69 to 37.98 months). Sixteen of 54 patients (29.62%) underwent antireflux surgery after lung transplant. LGD or EAC developed in 3 patients during posttransplant surveillance. One patient had a diagnosis of HGD 24 months after retransplant. She underwent complete endoscopic ablation and was dysplasia-free for 5 months, but ultimately the condition recurred, and she underwent esophagectomy for invasive cancer. Two patients had a diagnosis of LGD 7 and 13 months after lung transplant and were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation. The rate of progression to dysplasia or EAC was 2.3% per patient-year. CONCLUSIONS:BE seems to be more prevalent in lung transplant recipients than in the general population. The study findings suggest that patients with BE have a higher risk of BE-to-EAC progression after lung transplant and that HGD may progress rapidly in immunosuppressed patients. More intensive surveillance endoscopy may be required in patients with BE after lung transplant.",

Although limited, there is evidence that the esophagus contains a diverse microbial population, with Gram-positive bacteria, specifically Streptococcus, dominating in health, while Gram-negative bacteria prevail in reflux disorders including GERD and Barrett's esophagus. The microbiome is altered with other esophageal disorders as well, including eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal motility disorders, though these changes have been less well characterized.

Their consent to use their clinical data has improved our knowledge to the benefit of these same and other patients. The prevalence of BE increases with age both in men and in women. This increase starts at a younger age in men than in women. The incidence of high-grade dysplasia and cancer in BE depends on segment length, gender, and age. The latter two likely indicate the duration of the presence of BE in an individual patient. Other factors that influence the incidence of dysplasia and cancer are smoking behavior and use of certain medications such as PPIs, statins, and NSAIDs. Surveillance of BE and treatment of dysplasia can impact the incidence of and mortality due to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This is of major benefit to a subgroup of BE patients.

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions.",

METHODS:Recruitment to the PW cohort will take place in antenatal care clinics. PW will be enrolled regardless of symptoms and followed over the course of pregnancy, approximately every 4 weeks. PW will be revisited at delivery (or after miscarriage/abortion) to assess birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities according to the evolving definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). After birth, children will be followed for 2 years in the CH cohort. Follow-up visits are scheduled at ages 1-3, 4-6, 12, and 24 months to assess neurocognitive and developmental milestones. In addition, a NH cohort for the characterization of symptomatic rash/fever illness was designed, including follow-up to capture persisting health problems. Blood, urine, and other biological materials will be collected, and tested for ZIKV and other relevant arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever) using RT-PCR or serological methods. A virtual, decentralized biobank will be created. Reciprocal clinical monitoring has been established between partner sites. Substudies of ZIKV seroprevalence, transmission clustering, disabilities and health economics, viral kinetics, the potential role of antibody enhancement, and co-infections will be linked to the cohort studies.

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]",

Objectives:To expand the range of approaches available to assist in the identification of AZOOR by multimodal imaging and to analyze the fundus lesions by quantifying short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (quantitative fundus autofluorescence [qAF]) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Design, Setting, and Participants:In this observational study, patients underwent imaging at Columbia University Medical Center between November 2010 and March 2016 and were analyzed between September 2015 and August 2016. Six patients diagnosed as having AZOOR were studied by qAF and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and were compared with 30 age and race/ethnicity–matched controls from a database of 277 healthy control eyes. Main Outcomes and Measures:In unaffected regions of the macula, qAF was calculated within predetermined circularly arranged segments (qAF8). In addition, qAF was measured within specified regions of interest positioned at the autofluorescent lesion border (AZOOR line). Electroretinograms and electro-oculograms were recorded in 5 of 6 patients. Results:Among 6 patients (age range, 26-61 years; 4 female; 4 of white race/ethnicity, 1 Asian, and 1 Hispanic), 5 exhibited an autofluorescent AZOOR line in short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence images, delineating the peripapillary lesion. The mean (SD) region-of-interest qAF measured on the AZOOR line was 60 (26) times higher than in healthy control eyes (P = .03) at equivalent fundus locations. The qAF8 within nondiseased macular regions were within the normal range. At the lesion border, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed a loss of outer retinal integrity in all patients. Single-flash cone b-wave latency and 30-Hz flicker latency responses were significantly delayed bilaterally. Lesions with smooth, homogeneous borders exhibited only minimal expansion in size over time, while the lesion in a patient with a heterogeneous border progressed more rapidly. Conclusions and Relevance:The finding that qAF is elevated at the border between diseased and nondiseased retina in patients with AZOOR contributes to the understanding of the natural history of the disease.",

Two trained patients evaluated the optical coherence tomography angiography images for changes in the retinal and choroidal vasculature in the posterior pole.Four of eight eyes (50%) had birdshot lesions in the posterior pole as demonstrated on fundus photography. All of these eyes demonstrated the areas of decreased choroidal blood flow below the disrupted retinal pigment epithelium. Larger choroidal vessels bordered the birdshot lesions. All eyes analyzed showed retinal thinning, telangiectatic vessels, and an increased intercapillary space. Capillary dilatations and loops were each seen in 7 of 8 eyes (88%).Optical coherence tomography angiography provides precise microvascular detail of the retinal vasculature and choriocapillaris that allows for the noninvasive visualization of the birdshot lesions and changes in the inner retina.

CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old Hispanic woman presented with chief complaints of flickering lights and spots in her right eye that started 2 weeks earlier. Retinal examination revealed multiple white dots scattered across the retina, with an accompanying foveal granularity. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence were performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of MEWDS. The patient was monitored without treatment until resolution. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology and pathogenesis of MEWDS remain unknown; fortunately, the natural course of the disease is favorable because almost all patients retain a good outcome without the need for treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering MEWDS and other white dot syndromes in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with a history of photopsia. Because many clinical findings are absent or very subtle when patients present, the clinician should consider supplemental testing such as spectral domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence in aiding in the diagnosis.",

Whereas mother-to-child perinatal transmission of varicella zoster virus (VZV) can lead to disseminated life-threatening diseases in unimmunised newborns, postnatal acquisition will be generally a source of milder infections. The pattern and severity of the disease are known to be partly determined by the timing of VZV acquisition during pregnancy with the highest risk period located around delivery. Management of youngest children after contact with a varicella case remains difficult for clinicians not only because of unawareness of varicella natural history and risks factors for serious complications, but also because of the lack of consensus from experts available in the literature. This state of uncertainty often leads to overconsumption of healthcare resources with systematic hospitalisation and unjustified antiviral intravenous therapies. After a concise literature review, this article proposes pragmatic recommendations considering newborns in various scenarios following a contact with VZV, taking into account the timing and mode of virus transmission, the maternal immunological status, the baby's gestational age and the presence of other underlying conditions.",

The diagnosis of PCA is often delayed, to the detriment of the patient, and awareness and understanding of PCA will improve detection, prognostication, and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS:The natural history of PCA appears to be distinct from typical Alzheimer's disease and significant heterogeneity exists within the PCA syndrome, with the underlying causes of this heterogeneity beginning to be explored. Functional and molecular imaging can assist in better understanding PCA, particularly assessment of network disruptions that contribute to clinical phenotypes. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are useful to detect underlying pathology, but measures of retinal thickness are less promising. There are currently no adequate treatment options for PCA.

METHODS:We performed a systematic review of the literature published since 1996 to identify clinical features and investigations that may predict or exclude PSP pathology. We then extracted standardized data from clinical charts of patients with pathologically diagnosed PSP and relevant disease controls and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of key clinical features for PSP in this cohort. RESULTS:Of 4166 articles identified by the database inquiry, 269 met predefined standards. The literature review identified clinical features predictive of PSP, including features of the following 4 functional domains: ocular motor dysfunction, postural instability, akinesia, and cognitive dysfunction. No biomarker or genetic feature was found reliably validated to predict definite PSP.

A number of transgenic models expressing wild-type and mutant forms of the 4R Tau have been developed. However, few models of three-repeat Tau are available. A transgenic mouse model expressing three-repeat Tau was developed bearing the mutations associated with familial forms of Pick's disease (L266V and G272V mutations). Two lines expressing high (Line 13) and low (Line 2) levels of the three-repeat mutant Tau were analyzed. By Western blot, using antibodies specific to three-repeat Tau, Line 13 expressed 5-times more Tau than Line 2. The Tau expressed by these mice was most abundant in the frontal-temporal cortex and limbic system and was phosphorylated at residues detected by the PHF-1, AT8, CP9 and CP13 antibodies. The higher-expressing mice displayed hyperactivity, memory deficits in the water maze and alterations in the round beam. The behavioral deficits started at 6-8 months of age and were associated with a progressive increase in the accumulation of 3R Tau. By immunocytochemistry, mice from Line 13 displayed extensive accumulation of 3R Tau in neuronal cells bodies in the pyramidal neurons of the neocortex, CA1-3 regions, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

We reviewed donor and recipient liver biopsies to identify patients who developed de novo fatty liver following liver transplantation, recording the pretransplantation and posttransplantation blood sugar values and lipid profiles as well as body mass indices (BMI) of affected patients. RESULTS: Three patients developed de novo fatty liver after transplantation. The primary liver diseases among these patients were as follows: Crigler-Najjar syndrome, biliary atresia, and tyrosinemia. All of the patients who developed NAFLD were children. None of them had obesity; all had normal blood sugar values and lipid profiles (triglyceride cholesterol) at the time of and after the operation. Two patients received liver allografts from living related donors and 1 from a deceased donor. The BMI, lipid profile, and blood sugars of all donors were normal. Preoperative donor liver biopsy specimens showed normal histological findings with no evidence of a fatty liver, but the postoperative liver biopsy in recipients specimens revealed steatosis and fatty liver (20%-40% fat). Portal vein thrombosis and hepatic artery thrombosis were observed in the patients using color Doppler sonography. CONCLUSION: De novo NAFLD after liver transplantation occurred less frequently than noted in previous reports. All 3 patients experienced complicated courses.

We report the first natural history study of SURF1 deficiency. METHODS:We conducted a multi-centre case notes review of 44 SURF1-deficient patients from ten different UK centres and two Australian centres. Survival data for LRPPRC-deficient LS and nuclear-encoded complex I-deficient LS patients were obtained from previous publications. The survival of SURF1-deficient patients was compared with these two groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and logrank test. RESULTS:The majority of patients (32/44, 73%) presented in infancy (median 9.5 months). Frequent symptoms were poor weight gain (95%, median age 10 months), hypotonia (93%, median age 14 months), poor feeding/vomiting (89%, median age 10 months), developmental delay (88%, median age 14 months), developmental regression (71%, median age 19 months), movement disorder (52%, median age 24 months), oculomotor involvement (52%, median age 29 months) and central respiratory failure (78%, median age 31 months).

RESULTS: 55 of 56 patients were homozygous for the A354V mutation in LRPPRC. One was a genetic compound (A354V/C1277Xdel8). Clinical features included developmental delay, failure to thrive, characteristic facial appearance and, in 90% of patients, acute crises that have not previously been detailed, either metabolic (fulminant lactic acidosis) and/or neurological (Leigh syndrome and/or stroke-like episodes). Survival ranged from 5 days to >30 years. 46/56 patients (82%) died, at a median age of 1.6 years. Of 73 crises, 38 (52%) were fatal. The immediate causes of death were multiple organ failure and/or Leigh disease. Major predictors of mortality during crises (p<0.005) were hyperglycaemia, hepatic cytolysis, and altered consciousness at admission. Compared to a group of SURF1-deficient Leigh syndrome patients assembled from the literature, SLSJ-COX is distinct by the occurrence of metabolic crises, leading to earlier and higher mortality (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: SLSJ-COX is clinically distinct, with acute fatal acidotic crises on a backdrop of chronic moderate developmental delay and hyperlactataemia. Leigh syndrome is common. Stroke-like episodes can occur. The Leigh syndrome of SLSJ-COX differs from that of SURF1-related COX deficiency. SLSJ-COX has a different spectrum of associated abnormalities, acidotic crises being particularly suggestive of LRPPRC related Leigh syndrome. Even among A354V homozygotes, pronounced differences in survival and severity occur, showing that other genetic and/or environmental factors can influence outcome.",

Approximately 10% of the population will have one or more seizures during their lifetime. Seizures are symptoms that occur in acute illness, ie, provoked seizures, or in epilepsy, ie, unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is any disorder in which spontaneous recurrence of unprovoked seizures is the main symptom. It is a common chronic neurologic disorder and affects 1% to 3% of the population. Classification of seizure type is important because it enables identification of the region of the brain where the seizure originated and guides initial diagnostic testing. Classification of epilepsy syndrome, rather than only type of seizure, is more important. Epilepsy syndromes are defined by many factors, including type of seizures, age at onset of seizures, family history of seizures, and findings at physical examination, electroencephalography (EEG), and neurologic imaging studies. Identifying the epilepsy syndrome provides insight into natural history, prognosis, diagnostic testing, and therapy of the disorder and facilitates communication between health care professionals. Understanding seizure type provides useful information even when the epilepsy syndrome cannot be classified. Many sudden events are easily confused with seizures, in particular, pseudoseizures, syncope, migraine, cerebrovascular disease, movement disorders, and sleep disorders. In most cases a detailed history and physical examination concentrated on the details of the event, and results of routine EEG and magnetic resonance imaging can aid in determination of which events are seizures. Video EEG monitoring is occasionally necessary to capture events to enable definitive determination of whether they are seizures and to further characterize them. Provoked seizures are treated with relief of the provoking factor. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are not indicated. However, AEDs may be required to treat unprovoked seizures of new onset in patients at high risk for seizure recurrence or when a second seizure can have devastating psychosocial effects. High risk for recurrence is present when there is a history of brain insult, an EEG demonstrates epileptiform abnormalities, and magnetic resonance images demonstrate a structural lesion. AED therapy is the standard treatment for epilepsy, ie, two or more seizures. Selection of the appropriate AED depends on type of seizure and epilepsy present, and individual drug characteristics, including pharmacokinetics, side effects, dosing interval, and cost. All available AEDs except ethosuximide are effective as adjunctive therapy, and most are effective as initial monotherapy for partial seizures. Generalized seizures preferentially respond to valproate, lamotrigine, and topiramate, among other drugs. If trials of more than two AEDs do not control seizures, additional AEDs are unlikely to be effective, and the patient should be referred to an epilepsy center, where other treatment options, in particular, epilepsy surgery, can be offered. Epilepsy surgery renders 60% to 70% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy free of disabling seizures.",

We trapped 54 individual foxes and had 16 recaptures for a total of 70 fox samples between June 2003 and October 2004 in delineated urban and backcountry zones. We collected 296 adult and 145 nymphal ticks from the 70 captured foxes including 193 Ixodes pacificus, 149 Ixodes texanus, 98 Dermacentor variabilis, and one Dermacentor occidentalis. There were seasonal differences in tick intensities, with most I. pacificus adults occurring in winter and spring (P < 0.001), most I. texanus nymphs in spring (P = 0.03), and most D. variabilis adults in spring and summer (P = 0.01). Thirty-six (51%) of the 70 fox sera had antibodies against A. phagocytophilum, with a higher (P = 0.24) prevalence in backcountry foxes (16 of 23) than in urban-zone foxes (12 of 31). Six (9%) of 70 fox samples were polymerase chain reaction-positive for A. phagocytophilum. Twenty-eight (31%) of 90 domestic dogs sampled from vaccine clinics within the study area were seropositive for A. phagocytophilum. There was a significant difference in prevalence between dogs and backcountry foxes (70%), but no differences were found between dogs and urban foxes (39%). We propose that gray foxes are a good sentinel species for A. phagocytophilum infections in northwestern California.",

Data about disease in children have been largely derived from case reports or small case series. METHODS: A retrospective review of all medical and laboratory records from 6 sites located in the ""tick belt"" of the Southeastern United States was carried out. Demographic, history and laboratory data were abstracted from the identified medical records of patients. Bivariate statistical comparisons were performed using Fisher exact test or Wilcoxon rank sum tests. RESULTS: Common clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HME (n = 32) included fever (100%), headache (69%), myalgia (69%), rash (66%), nausea/vomiting (56%), altered mental status (50%) and lymphadenopathy (47%). Only 48% had a complaint of fever, headache and rash. Common laboratory abnormalities included thrombocytopenia (94%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (90%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (74%), hypoalbuminemia (65%), lymphopenia (57%), leukopenia (56%) and hyponatremia (55%). The median number of days of illness before the initiation of antirickettsial therapy was 6. Patients who received sulfonamides before starting doxycycline therapy developed a rash, were admitted to the hospital, and started doxycycline at a later date. Twenty-two percent of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit with 12.5% of patients requiring ventilatory and blood pressure support. CONCLUSIONS: Although HME has been recognized among children for almost 20 years, there is only a limited knowledge about its clinical course. Even among physicians practicing in endemic regions, few cases are diagnosed each year. More work is needed to understand the true burden of disease and the natural history among asymptomatically and symptomatically infected children.",

Significant progress has been made in correcting lethal primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with hematopoietic transplantation in the ensuing 40 years due to several factors: (1) ability to phenotype and quantitate (CD34+) hematopoietic stem cells, (2) advent of high-resolution tissue typing, (3) availability of closely matched unrelated donor bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, and cord blood, and (4) the application of reduced intensity conditioning regimens pre-transplant. Furthermore, the genetic basis of the majority of lethal PIDs has been defined, allowing more accurate studies of the natural history of the disorders without HCT intervention, and providing a compelling rationale for early transplantation in disorders with median survivals of 15-20 years. In the current era, we can identify several factors, which influence the ultimate success of HCT for PID. These include the age at transplant and general health of the patient. Young age is associated with fewer comorbidities and less frequent pre-transplant exposure to herpes family and enteric viruses, thus lowering the risks of related post-transplant complications. The careful selection of pre-transplant conditioning can significantly reduce early TRM in patients with certain immunodeficiencies, and increase the probability of durable engraftment in others. Because of the specific needs of children with PIDs, HCT from unrelated donors should, ideally, be performed in centers with extensive expertise and experience in the treatment of such disorders. In such centers, donor selection based on high-resolution tissue typing, younger age and specific viral immunity has led to survival rates following matched unrelated donor HCT for PIDs, which are very similar to those obtained with HCT from matched sibling donors. While ultimate success rates are similar, transplant-related management of children receiving unrelated grafts is considerably more complicated and prolonged than following matched sibling HCT.",

Objectives:Assess the natural history of clinical and laboratory findings in 24 patients with JMC and characterize the disease-causing mutant receptors in vitro. Patients and Methods:The H223R mutation occurred in 18 patients. T410P, I458R and I458K each occurred in single cases; T410R was present in a father and his two sons. Laboratory records were analyzed individually and in aggregate. Results:Postnatal calcium levels were normal in most patients, but elevated between 0.15 and 10 years (11.8 ± 1.37 mg/dL) and tended to normalize in adults (10.0 ± 1.03 mg/dL). Mean phosphate levels were at the lower end of the age-specific normal ranges. Urinary calcium/creatinine (mg/mg) were consistently elevated (children, 0.80 ± 0.40; adults, 0.28 ± 0.19).

METHOD:We analyzed death certificates, and medical records of BSCL patients who died between 1997 and 2017. If the death certificate was incomplete or unavailable, we reviewed the medical records, and if they were not available too, we collected information from the patient's relatives to understand how the death happened. We calculated the potential years of life lost as a result of premature death. RESULTS:Twenty patients (12 female and 8 male) died between 1997 and 2017. The mean age at the time of death was 27.1±12.4 years (women 25.2±12.5 vs. men 29.9±12.6 years, p = 0.41). Life expectancy for the study population was 62.9±4.8 years.

These patients with NPS did not show hyperinsulinemia or dyslipidemia. Their karyotypes were all normal, while the chromosomal breakage test showed markedly increased breakage rates in four patients. LMNA, ERCC8, or ZMPSTE24 gene mutations could not account for the disorders in these patients. Four patients died after sepsis or aspiration pneumonia at the age of 1.1, 4, 6.2 and 7.5 years.Increased chromosomal breakage and the presence of basal ganglia calcification after early childhood suggest that DNA repair defects are involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder. This rare disorder represents a complex of symptoms with unknown cause and pathogenesis, and more than one disease may account for the clinical variability of NPS.",

The association with several malignant tumors of local and worldwide distribution makes EBV one of the most important tumor viruses. Furthermore, because EBV can cause posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease, transplant medicine has to deal with EBV as a major pathogenic virus second only to cytomegalovirus. In this review, we summarize briefly the natural history of EBV infection and outline some of the recent advances in the pathogenesis of the major EBV-associated neoplasms. We present alternative scenarios and discuss them in the light of most recent experimental data. Emerging research areas including EBV-induced patho-epigenetic alterations in host cells and the putative role of exosome-mediated information transfer in disease development are also within the scope of this review. This book contains an in-depth description of a series of modern methodologies used in EBV research. In this introductory chapter, we thoroughly refer to the applications of these methods and demonstrate how they contributed to the understanding of EBV-host cell interactions. The data gathered using recent technological advancements in molecular biology and immunology as well as the application of sophisticated in vitro and in vivo experimental models certainly provided deep and novel insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms of EBV infection and EBV-associated tumorigenesis.

Due to their rarity and the multifaceted histology, an endoscopic classification has not been validated yet. This review aims to analyze the endoscopic presentation of rare gastrointestinal lymphomas from disease diagnosis to follow-up, according to the involved site and lymphoma subtype. Existing, new and emerging endoscopic technologies have been examined. In particular, we investigated the diagnostic, prognostic and follow-up endoscopic features of T-cell and natural killer lymphomas, lymphomatous polyposis and mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, plasma cell related disease, gastrointestinal lymphomas in immunodeficiency and Hodgkin's lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Contrarily to more frequent gastrointestinal lymphomas, data about rare lymphomas are mostly extracted from case series and case reports. Due to the data paucity, a synergism between gastroenterologists and hematologists is required in order to better manage the disease. Indeed, clinical and prognostic features are different from nodal and extranodal or the bone marrow (in case of plasma cell disease) counterpart.

Extended UV exposure during childhood or adolescence significantly increases the probability of skin cancer in adulthood. OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to analyse knowledge, attitudes and behaviour regarding exposure to natural and artificial UV radiation among Belgrade high school students. METHODS:The study was conducted using a questionnaire among 549 students of 3rd and 4th grade (17 and 18 years of age) in four Belgrade high schools. The questionnaire had 32 questions: questions about gender, date and month of birth and parents' education, nine questions regarding sunbed use, nine questions regarding behaviour in the sun during summer months, four questions regarding personal and family history and skin phototype and seven questions regarding attitude and general knowledge about effects of UV radiation. Assessment of frequency rate and relative numbers was used as methods of descriptive statistics. RESULTS:As many as 39% of participants had used a sunbed at least once, 38% plan on using it in the future. One quarter spends more than 3 hours in the sun on the beach during summer without any protection, and only one-third of participants had not experienced sunburn during last summer. Only one-half of students know what melanoma is, while 37% stated that they do not know.

113,GARD:0000091,"Malignant melanoma, childhood",27149135,['Journal Article'],Knowledge about Ultraviolet Radiation Hazards and Tanning Behavior of Cosmetology and Medical Students.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27149135,"Dear Editor, Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a well-known physical hazard responsible for photoaging, photoallergic, and phototoxic reactions as well as carcinogenesis, including life-threatening melanomas (1,2). Overexposure to both natural and artificial UV radiation is a public health concern. 30% of cancers diagnosed worldwide are skin cancers. Approximately three million non-melanoma skin cancers and 132 000 new cases of melanomas are diagnosed globally each year (3). Sunburns, especially in childhood, are a very important risk factor for melanomas. Several studies demonstrated a positive association between sunbed use and an increased incidence of malignant melanoma (4). Current medical and cosmetology students will soon be knowledge providers about the risks of excessive exposure to UV radiation and prophylaxis of its consequences. Our aim was to evaluate their knowledge about the side effects of ultraviolet radiation and tanning behaviors. Details on the knowledge and habits of students were obtained during classes at the Poznan University of Medical Sciences. With approval from the Institutional Bioethical Committee, a 41-question anonymous survey was conducted in the spring of 2012 among 190 medical (1-6 year) and cosmetology students (1-5 year). The mean age of the study group was 22.3 years (standard deviation (SD) = 2.4 years), range 19-28 years. The survey was composed of closed and open-ended questions prepared by the authors. The first part of the form included demographic data: gender, age, degree course, and school year. The students were also asked about their reaction to sunlight, sunburns in childhood, and personal and family history of skin cancers or dysplastic nevus syndrome. The factual section of the survey contained questions evaluating responder knowledge about sunbeds and risk of UV radiation as well as their personal tanning habits. The open-ended questions asked responders to provide definitions of: skin phototype, sun protection factor (SPF), and tanorexia. The students were additionally asked to mention possible side effects of solar radiation and contraindications to sunbeds and drugs, which may induce photosensitivity. Statistical analysis was performed using The R Project for Statistical Computing. Chi-squared test was used to compare both sun-risk knowledge and tanning behaviors between medical and cosmetology students. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. We distributed 220 questionnaires and received 190 (86%) eligible for evaluation. Table 1 shows the study population. Gender distribution among groups was uneven, with significantly more male subjects in the medicine program group. We decided to include their answers in this study to provide an unbiased view of both of those programs. Where appropriate, we additionally provided comparisons between female subjects in both groups to prove that differences were not solely due to uneven gender distribution. When we asked students to define skin phototype, cosmetology students more frequently gave a correct definition. In the group of students who stated they knew the definition of skin phototype, medical students were significantly more frequently wrong when we asked them to explain the term in their own words. Cosmetology students correctly answered significantly more knowledge checking questions (Table 2). When we asked students to list photosensitizing agents, students of the cosmetology program gave twice as many correct answers per respondent as students of the medicine program (see Table 3). Cosmetology students more frequently listed retinoids, while medical students listed tetracyclines as the main photosensitizing drug. The most common answer in the cosmetology group was the herb of Hypericum perforatum, although it is not considered a drug. Psoralens were identified by only 4 medical students as a possible cause of phototoxicity. When students were asked to list adverse effects of sunbathing, we specifically looked for three responses (see Table 4). Cosmetology students listed those answers significantly more often than medical students. Students of the cosmetology program gave significantly more correct answers when asked to list contraindications for sunbathing. While medical students reported mainly pregnancy (as a contraindication for most medical procedures), cosmetology students reported history of skin cancer as the most frequent answer (Table 5). Cosmetology students (89.04%) stated they visited a tanning salon more often than medical students (46.55%) (P<0.0001). When we restricted this analysis to only female subjects there still was a significant difference (P=0.0002) between cosmetology and medical female students. Cosmetology students reported lower incidence of sunscreen use (83.78% vs. 97.39%; P=0.0019). The age of the first tanning studio visit was also lower for cosmetology students (mean = 16.5 years) than medical students (mean = 17.2 years), (P=0.0290). Figure 1 illustrates the frequency of student tanning studio visits; the difference between groups was significant (P=0.0308). Skin cancers, dysplastic nevi syndrome, and precancerous lesions were reported in the family history by 19 students (10.00%). 12 of those students (63.16%) were also tanning salons users. 85 students (44.74%) reported a history of a sunburn in their childhood and over half of them continue visiting tanning salons. Some American (5) and French (6) studies assessed medical student knowledge and behaviors concerning sun risk and its prevention. The results of these studies indicated that medical school students did not have a satisfactory awareness about sun risk hazards. The French evaluation showed medical student knowledge was comparable to that of the French general population. Studies evaluating Polish student knowledge (7-9) showed ignorance of the term Fitzpatrick's skin phototype. We emphasize this because patients with phototype 1 and 2 are more susceptible to the development of skin cancers (10) and ignorance in this matter may be dangerous. UV rays may promote drug-induced photosensitivity reactions such as phototoxicity and photoallergy (1), with the most common causes being: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (ketoprofen, ibuprofen, piroxicam, diclofenac), cardiovascular drugs (furosemid, amiodarone, thiazides), antibiotics (tetracyclines, ciprofloxacine, sulfonamides), psoralens, and oral contraceptives (11). Our study found deficient knowledge about drugs which may trigger photosensitivity reactions. Cosmetology students reported significantly more risky tanning behavior but did better in knowledge checking questions, which may be explained by their personal interest in this subject or by educational focus due to their major. We suggest that better knowledge about sunbathing in general is due to increased interest in this matter (not solely due to formal education) and this interest derives from a positive attitude towards a tanned appearance. It has been proven that sunbathing shows signs of addictive behavior (12). Tanorexia as a term was more widely known among cosmetology students, which may illustrate that although students knew about the addictive properties of tanning, they were sure that this did not apply to them. Many studies showed that increased knowledge did not translate into safer tanning habits (13,14). Our study agrees with those findings. Our study demonstrated that medical and cosmetology student knowledge about sunbeds and risk of UV radiation is deficient. However, cosmetology students demonstrated better knowledge than medical students. Future cosmetologists may be better information providers about sun risk and its prevention. On the other hand, students of the cosmetology faculty tended to tan more often and longer and engage in more risky behavior despite being aware of the hazards of tanning. They may be more likely to develop skin cancers in the future.",

The negative effects of solar radiation are accumulated during the entire lifetime; however 80% of total lifetime sun exposure is taking place before the age of 18 years. Child skin is more sensitive than adult skin because natural defense mechanisms are not fully developed. A short exposure to midday sun will result in sunburns. Epidemiologic studies show a higher incidence of malignant melanoma in persons with a history of sunburns during childhood and adolescence. Sun exposure among infants and pre-school children is largely dependent on the discretion of adult care providers. Sun protective habits of mothers may predict the level of sun exposure in children. It is very important to transfer the knowledge and positive habits of proper sun protection to children. The purpose of sun-safety behavior is not to avoid outdoor activities, but rather to protect the skin from detrimental sun effects. Proper sun protection of children includes protection from excessive sun exposure, sunburns and other forms of skin damage caused by sun, which may lead to the future development of skin cancers.

OBJECTIVES To determine the course of pediatric PC, correlate the disease course with the clinical appearance and specific gene mutations, and assess the effect of pediatric PC on quality of life. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS One hundred one patients or families with genetically confirmed PC from the International Pachyonychia Congenita Research Registry who completed a survey on the general clinical features of PC and an auxiliary questionnaire on the clinical presentation and quality-of-life issues related to pediatric PC. EXPOSURE Individuals with pachyonychia congenita. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Completion of both surveys. RESULTS At birth, toenail changes were present in 47.5% of patients; fingernail changes in 40.6%; and plantar keratoderma in 6.9%. By 5 years of age, these 3 key manifestations were found in 81.2%, 74.2%, and 75.3%, respectively, of individuals with genotype-confirmed PC. The correct diagnosis was made during the first year of life in 26.7% of patients despite the presence of toenail dystrophy in more than 65.3%. Clinical differences that distinguished PC subtypes included (1) later onset and less frequent occurrence of nail dystrophy and keratoderma in PC-K6b, PC-K6c, and PC-K16; (2) concurrent fingernail and toenail thickening in PC-K6a and PC-K17; (3) more palmar keratoderma in PC-K16; (4) cysts primarily in PC-K17 and follicular hyperkeratoses primarily in PC-K6a; (5) hoarseness and/or oral leukokeratoses in the first year of life most often in PC-K6a; and (6) natal teeth exclusively in PC-K17. Among pediatric patients, PC affected the social interactions and function of adolescents most profoundly. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with a detectable mutation, PC manifests with nail thickening and plantar keratoderma before school age in more than three-quarters of affected children, allowing early diagnosis. The highly visible nail changes and painful plantar thickening exert a psychosocial effect on most affected adolescents. Phenotype-genotype correlations in children with PC validate the new classification based on the affected gene.",

According to his mother, the first episode presented with blistering at 7 days of age. Ever since, the condition has steadily worsened to acquire the current status. He was married at the age of 18 years, and had a stillborn child 18 months afterwards. Presently, he has three children, two girls aged 14 and 12 years and a son aged 10 years. Both the daughters are similarly affected. While cataloguing the details of the pattern of inheritance, the mother of the index case was also found to be affected (Fig. 1). The natural history of the disease was identical. Examination of the palms was marked by pronounced thickening of the skin resulting in the masking of palmar creases. The thickening was well demarcated and its margins were prominent and surrounded by an erythematous halo. The color of the skin was yellow and waxy (Fig. 2a). Contractures were present on all the fingers; nevertheless, the deformity of the middle and distal interphalangeal joints of the little finger was prominent.

Myo-MRI is widely used to identify abnormalities in muscle signal, volume or texture. Recognizable profiles or patterns have been identified in many of these genetic myopathies. The role of the radiologist is crucial in order to adapt the Myo-MRI protocols to the age of the patient and several clinical situations.

RESULTS:Motor deficits according to MFM-32 were primarily observed in the standing and transfers domain (D1; mean 71%). Among the GFTs, participants required the most time to ascend/descend stairs (>7.5 s). Functional movement, determined by GFT grades, was strongly correlated with MFM-32 (D1; r ≥ 0.770, P < 0.001). Motor Function Measure-32 and GFT scores did not reflect any change in performance between baseline and 6-month visits.

(2018). Laryngoscope Investig Otolaryngol 3:22; Derkay (1995). Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 121:1386]. In addition, it is potentially deadly, with risk of airway obstruction as well as a 3-7% risk of malignant conversion [Schraff et al. (2004). Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 130:1039]. This review highlights exciting advancements over the past 1-2 years in scientific understanding of the pathophysiology, epidemiology, natural history, prevention, and treatment of this difficult disease. RECENT FINDINGS:Recent studies have yielded the following findings: The primary quality of life reduction that patients perceive is voice-related; the membranous vocal folds are the most frequently involved anatomic subsite in adult-onset RRP; there may be a correlation between laryngopharyngeal reflux, herpes simplex virus type 2, and adult-onset RRP; there has been a decline in RRP incidence in Australia following the implementation of a national vaccination program; addition of educational audiovisual aids assists in vaccine acceptance rates; preventive vaccination can be used as treatment for pediatric as well as adult RRP patients with demonstrable effects on antibody titers and reoperation rates; calreticulin-linked DNA vaccines show promise in reducing the growth rate of human papilloma virus (HPV)11 E6/E7-expressing tumors in mice; injection of bevacizumab is associated with no adverse tissue affects; systemic bevacizumab is effective as a treatment for severe uncontrolled disease; pegylated interferon treatment is effective in select severe pediatric RRP disease; and finally, increased rates of programed death 1 T-lymphocyte infiltration and programed death-ligand 1 expression are seen on both papilloma and infiltrating immune cells. SUMMARY:RRP is declining in incidence but remains a challenging disease to treat with great costs to patients, families, and the healthcare system. As the disease continues to be better understood, new frontiers are opening in treatment, particularly for severe or poorly controlled disease.

Clinical recognition can be challenging, so echocardiography is often the means by which definitive diagnosis is made. The tricuspid valve and right ventricle are on the systemic arterial side of the ccTGA circulation, and are therefore subject to progressive functional deterioration. The natural history of ccTGA is also greatly influenced by the nature and severity of accompanying lesions, some of which require surgical repair. Some management strategies leave the right ventricle as the systemic arterial pump, but carry the risk of worsening heart failure. More complex 'double switch' repairs establish the left ventricle as the systemic pump, and include an atrial baffle to redirect venous return in combination with either arterial switch or Rastelli operation (if a suitable ventricular septal defect permits). Occasionally, the anatomic peculiarities of ccTGA do not allow straightforward biventricular repair, and Fontan palliation is a reasonable option.

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment.

This study describes the varying ocular phenotypes in JS patients, with correlation to systemic findings and genotype. DESIGN:Patients were systematically and prospectively examined at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in the setting of a dedicated natural history clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS:Ninety-nine patients with JS examined at a single center. METHODS:All patients underwent genotyping for JS, followed by complete age-appropriate ophthalmic examinations at the NIH Clinical Center, including visual acuity (VA), fixation behavior, lid position, motility assessment, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundus examination with an indirect ophthalmoscope, and retinoscopy. Color and fundus autofluorescence imaging, Optos wide-field photography (Dunfermline, Scotland, UK), and electroretinography (ERG) were performed when possible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:The VA (with longitudinal follow-up where possible), ptosis, extraocular muscle function, retinal and optic nerve status, and retinal function as measured by ERG. RESULTS:Among patients with JS with quantifiable VA (68/99), values ranged from 0 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) (Snellen 20/20) to 1.5 logMAR (Snellen 20/632). Strabismus (71/98), nystagmus (66/99), oculomotor apraxia (60/77), ptosis (30/98), coloboma (28/99), retinal degeneration (20/83), and optic nerve atrophy (8/86) were identified. CONCLUSIONS:We recommend regular monitoring for ophthalmological manifestations of JS beginning soon after birth or diagnosis. We demonstrate delayed visual development and note that the amblyogenic time frame may last significantly longer in JS than is typical. In general, patients with coloboma were less likely to display retinal degeneration, and those with retinal degeneration did not have coloboma. Severe retinal degeneration that is early and aggressive is seen in disease caused by specific genes, such as CEP290- and AHI1-associated JS. Retinal degeneration in INPP5E-, MKS1-, and NPHP1-associated JS was generally milder. Finally, ptosis surgery can be helpful in a subset of patients with JS; decisions as to timing and benefit/risk ratio need to be made on an individual basis according to expert consultation.",

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by violent motor and vocal behavior during REM sleep which represents dream enactment. The normal loss of muscle tone, with the exception of respiratory, sphincter, extra ocular and middle ear muscles, is absent in patients with RBD. The origin of RBD is frequently unknown, but can be associated with degenerative neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients do not necessarily express features of RBD, which is identified in approximately third to a half of them. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of RBD in a cohort of PD patients, as well as to identify risk-factors for its development. METHODS:In the period from December 2010 to September 2011 we recruited 97 consecutive PD outpatients, treated in the Institute of Neurology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade. After establishing the diagnosis, all the patients filled out a specially constructed questionnaire with the following items: actual age, sex, age at disease onset, disease duration, form of the disease, type of treatment, duration of treatment, the presence of constipation, lessening of smell sense, and family history of PD. At entring the study, patients disability was scored using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (motor part - UPDRS). Cognitive abilities were assessed by the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scale, and depression symptoms by the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The patients with PD were dichotomized to those with and without RBD using the RBD Questionnaire-Hong Kong (RBDQ-HK) in the manner of an interview. Forms of PD, mode of treatment, sex, constipation and family history were investigated using the Fishers χ2 test. Symptoms and treatment duration, the presence of smell disturbances, MMSE score, UPDRS motor score and HDRS score were analyzed by implementation of the Z-test. Actual age and age at disease onset were evaluated by the unpaired t-test. RESULTS:The RBD-positive group contained 15 (15.5%) patients, while in the rest of them (82/97), RBD was not identified (nonRBD group). There was no difference between the two groups considering gender distribution (p = 0.847), age (p = 0.577), age at disease onset (p = 0.141 ), duration. of PD (p = 0.069), family history (p = 0.591), type of initial symptoms (p = 0.899), constipation (p = 0.353), olfaction (p = 0.32) and MMSE scores (p = 0.217). The duration of treatment in the RBD group was longer than in the non-RBD group (9.4 ± 5.3 and 6.3 ± 3.9 years, respectively; p = 0.029), and the UPDRS motor score in the RBD group was higher (19.1 ± 9.4 and 12.7 ± 8.2, respectively; p = 0.013). Also, HDRS scores were higher in patients expressing RBD (10.1 ± 6.0 and 6.4 ± 4.5, respectively; p = 0.019). CONCLUSION:We found that 15.5% of the consecutive PD patients had RBD, and that the patients with RBD differed from the non-RBD ones regarding duration of treatment, disease and depressive symptoms severity.",

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions.",

Diseases such as poliomyelitis, diphtheria or tetanus almost disappeared in industrialized countries. The same happened with epiglottitis and meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) after vaccination against Hib was introduced in Switzerland in 1990. This success was possible because of routine vaccination. Immunization is a save procedure and adverse events are much lower than complications in the natural course of the prevented diseases. However vaccinations were accused to cause diseases themselves such as asthma, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic arthritis or autism. Hitherto no large cohort study or case-control-study was able to proof responsibility of vaccines in any of these diseases. Public media are eager to publish early data from surveillance reports or case reports which are descriptive and never a principle of cause and effect. In large controlled trials there was no proof that vaccination causes asthma, hepatitis-B-vaccination causes multiple sclerosis or macrophagic myofasciitis, Hib-vaccination causes diabetes mellitus, rubella-vaccination causes chronic arthritis, measles-mumps-rubella-vaccination causes gait disturbance or thiomersal causes autism. These results are rarely published in newspapers or television. Thus, many caring parents are left with negative ideas about immunization. Looking for the best for their children they withhold vaccination and give way to resurgence of preventable diseases in our communities. This must be prevented. There is more evidence than expected that vaccination is safe and this can and must be told to parents.",

All patients present from birth with macrothrombocytopenia, but in infancy or adult life, some of them develop sensorineural deafness, presenile cataracts, and/or progressive nephritis leading to end-stage renal failure. No consistent correlations have been identified between the 27 different MYH9 mutations identified so far and the variable clinical evolution of the disease. We have evaluated 108 consecutive MYH9-RD patients belonging to 50 unrelated pedigrees. The risk of noncongenital manifestations associated with different genotypes was estimated over time by event-free survival analysis. We demonstrated that all subjects with mutations in the motor domain of NMMHC-IIA present with severe thrombocytopenia and develop nephritis and deafness before the age of 40 years, while those with mutations in the tail domain have a much lower risk of noncongenital complications and significantly higher platelet counts. We also evaluated the clinical course of patients with mutations in the four most frequently affected residues of NMMHC-IIA (responsible for 70% of MYH9-RD cases). We concluded that mutations at residue 1933 do not induce kidney damage or cataracts and cause deafness only in the elderly, those in position 702 result in severe thrombocytopenia and produce nephritis and deafness at a juvenile age, while alterations at residue 1424 or 1841 result in intermediate clinical pictures.

Objective:To estimate the progression rate of atrophic lesions in the prospective Natural History of the Progression of Atrophy Secondary to Stargardt Disease (ProgStar) study over a 12-month period. Design, Setting, and Participants:This multicenter prospective cohort study was conducted in an international selection of tertiary referral centers from October 21, 2013, to February 15, 2017. Patients who were affected by Stargardt disease, aged 6 years and older at baseline, and harboring disease-causing variants of the ABCA4 gene were enrolled at 9 centers in the United States, United Kingdom, and continental Europe. Data analysis occurred from November 2016 to January 2017. Exposures:Autofluorescence images obtained with a standard protocol were sent to a central reading center, and areas of definitely decreased autofluorescence, questionably decreased autofluorescence, and the total combined area of decreased autofluorescence were outlined and quantified. Progression rates were estimated from linear mixed models with time as the independent variable. Main Outcomes and Measures:Yearly rate of progression, using the growth of atrophic lesions measured by autofluorescence imaging. Results:A total of 259 study participants (488 eyes; 230 individuals [88.8%] were examined in both eyes) were enrolled (mean [SD] age at first visit, 33.3 [15.1] years; 118 [54.4%] female). Gradable images were available for evaluation for 480 eyes at baseline and 454 eyes after 12 months. At baseline, definitely decreased autofluorescence was present in 306 eyes, and the mean (SD) lesion size was 3.93 (4.37) mm2. The mean total area of decreased autofluorescence at baseline was 4.07 (4.04) mm2. The estimated progression of definitely decreased autofluorescence was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.54-0.97) mm2 per year (P < .001), and the total area of both questionably and definitely decreased autofluorescence was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50-0.78) mm2 per year (P < .001). Both progression rates depended on initial lesion size. Conclusions and Relevance:In Stargardt disease, autofluorescence imaging may serve as a monitoring tool and definitely decreased autofluorescence and total area as outcome measures for interventional clinical trials that aim to slow disease progression. Rates of progression depended mainly on initial lesion size.",

CLINICAL RELEVANCE:Controversy exists regarding the progression pattern of atrophic lesions secondary to STGD1, and the reported growth rates vary widely among studies. METHODS:We searched in 6 literature databases up through March 15, 2019, to identify studies that monitored atrophy progression by fundus autofluorescence in untreated eyes with STGD1 for 6 months or more. We analyzed both study- and individual-level data from the included studies using 3 models: the area linear model (ALM), radius linear model (RLM), and area exponential model (AEM), in which the area, radius, and natural log-transformed area changes linearly with time, respectively. A horizontal translation factor was added to each dataset to correct for different participants' entry times into the studies. The best model was determined by the predicted age of lesion onset and dependence of growth rates on baseline lesion sizes. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS:Of 3158 articles screened, 7 studies (564 eyes) met our inclusion criteria. Cumulative study- and individual-level datasets fit along a straight line in the RLM after introducing horizontal translation factors to correct for different entry times (r2 = 0.99 and r2 = 0.93, respectively). The growth rate of effective lesion radius was 0.104 mm/year (95% confidence interval, 0.086-0.123 mm/year). The age of atrophy onset predicted by the RLM (22.7±5.0 years) was comparable to the reported age at onset of symptoms (22.1±3.1 years); in contrast, the predictions by the ALM and AEM deviated from this number by more than 5 years. Based on the individual-level data, the effective radius growth rate was independent of the baseline lesion size (r = 0.06); in comparison, the growth rates of area and natural log-transformed area were significantly dependent on the baseline lesion size (r = 0.47 and r = -0.33, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:The progression of STGD1 lesions followed the RLM in both study- and individual-level data. The effective radius growth rate of atrophic lesions could serve as a reliable outcome measure to monitor STGD1 progression.",

All scans were analyzed twice by two graders to evaluate reliability. The annual rate of EZ width and area loss were calculated. Results:The intra- and intergrader reliability of transverse EZ loss and area of EZ loss measurements at baseline for both graders was 0.99. The mean annual rate of transverse EZ loss (±standard deviation) was 279.5 ± 259.9 μm/y. The mean rate of area of EZ loss (±standard deviation) was 1.20 ± 1.29 mm2/y. The percentage transverse EZ loss was 10.2 ± 9.9%/y, which was significantly lower than the area of EZ loss at 19.4 ± 16.3%/y. High degree of interocular symmetry was observed. Conclusions:This is a prospective study on the quantification of EZ loss in children with STGD1 and highlights the reliability of SD-OCT in measuring EZ loss.

Fifteen of the 20 patients with Best disease had more than 1 visit, and the imaging studies from each visit were compared with each other over time.Evolution of visual acuity and clinical stage of BVMD correlated to OCT measurement parameters, including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thickness, central macular thickness, and integrity of the ellipsoid zone.Patients with BVMD demonstrated progressive disorganization and thinning of the submacular RPE on OCT when compared with normal controls.

Retrospective study of a series of 85 patients],https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2081852,"Since 1974 (Gass), many publications have referred to a macular abnormality that is similar to Best's vitelliform dystrophy, but occurs in adults and shows a normal or subnormal electro-oculogram. In our retrospective study, 85 patients with adult macular vitelliform degeneration were included; 31 patients out of 85 have been followed-up for periods ranging from one to ten years. Women (62,3%) were predominantly affected; the median age was 61 years (ranging from 37 to 81 years); family history did not reveal others affected members except in one case (mother and her son affected); electro-oculogram was recorded in 12 patients and was normal (8 patients) or slightly subnormal (4 patients). During follow-up, vitelliform lesions have shown progressive changes over many years, resulting in a round or oval atrophic area in the central retinal pigment epithelium. Visual acuity was fair at presentation but decreased progressively: at presentation, 43% of the eyes had visual acuity better or equal to 0.6; after 1 year, 59%; after 2 years, 28.5%; after 4 years, 20%, and only 8% of those followed-up for 10 years. Impairment of vision was usually related to alteration of the retinal pigment epithelium and macular atrophy, sometimes to subretinal neovascularization (14 eyes of 12 patients out of 157, or 15% of patients), or rarely to macular edema (2 cases). Several aspects of this disease are still controversial: firstly, the problem whether or not the disease represents a single nosological entity; secondarily its dominant inheritance. The analysis of our cases and of those already published seems to show that the macular changes observed are related to a single disease, well-defined by the epidemiology, the clinical aspects, the natural course. The late onset of the disease, the lack of constant familial involvement and the similarity with other retinal degenerative disorders seem to suggest that vitelliform macular lesions may represent a distinct subgroup of age-related macular degeneration, with a possible genetic predisposition.",

While the goal of eradicating such diseases is enticing, historical experience validates abandoning eradication in favor of ecologically based control strategies (which reduce morbidity and mortality to a locally accepted risk level). During the 20th century, one of the most extensive plague-eradication efforts in recorded history was undertaken to enable large-scale changes in land use in the former Soviet Union (including vast areas of central Asia). Despite expending tremendous resources in its attempt to eradicate plague, the Soviet antiplague response gradually abandoned the goal of eradication in favor of plague control linked with developing basic knowledge of plague ecology. Drawing from this experience, we combine new gray-literature sources, historical and recent research, and fieldwork to outline best practices for the control of spillover from zoonoses while minimally disrupting wildlife ecosystems, and we briefly compare the Soviet case with that of endemic plague in the western United States. We argue for the allocation of sufficient resources to maintain ongoing local surveillance, education, and targeted control measures; to incorporate novel technologies selectively; and to use ecological research to inform developing landscape-based models for transmission interruption. We conclude that living with emergent and reemergent zoonotic diseases-switching to control-opens wider possibilities for interrupting spillover while preserving natural ecosystems, encouraging adaptation to local conditions, and using technological tools judiciously and in a cost-effective way.",

We also measured biomarkers in the spinal fluid (phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain pNFH, neuron-specific enolase NSE, proteins, ß-Amyloid 1-40, ß-Amyloid 1-42, tau and phospho-tau) and creatine kinase (CK). Assessments were performed at baseline, day 63 (V4), day 180 (V5) and day 300 (V6). For statistical analysis, we compared baseline to V4, V5 and V6, using the paired sample t-test.

RESULTS:19 patients were included, 17 of them have completed the observation period of 10 months (day 300, V6). Patients were aged 18 to 59 years with disease duration ranging from 6 to 53 years. Except for the 6MWT, the RULM and the peak cough flow, there were no relevant significant changes in all functional outcome assessments at V4, V5 or V6, compared to baseline. For the 6MWT, there was a statistically significant improvement at visit 5 and at visit 6. RULM-score increased significantly at V6, and peak cough flow at visit 5. In biomarker studies, there was a significant decline in NSE and pTAU as well as a slight increase in proteins. In safety analysis, overall, Nusinersen applications were well tolerated. Eleven patients reported adverse events that were related to the study procedures, comprising back pain in seven patients and post-lumbar-puncture headache following intrathecal administration in four patients.

Mean HFMSE scores, ULM scores, and 6MWT distances improved by the day 1,150 visit (HFMSE: SMA type II, +10.8 points; SMA type III, +1.8 points; ULM: SMA type II, +4.0 points; 6MWT: SMA type III, +92.0 meters). Mean CMAP values remained relatively stable. No children discontinued treatment due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS:Nusinersen treatment over ∼3 years resulted in motor function improvements and disease activity stabilization not observed in natural history cohorts. These results document the long-term benefit of nusinersen in later-onset SMA, including SMA type III. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER:NCT01703988 (ISIS-396443-CS2); NCT02052791 (ISIS-396443-CS12).

This study assessed the health outcomes of SMA1 infants treated with AVXS-101 gene replacement therapy. METHODS:Twelve genetically confirmed SMA1 infants with homozygous deletions of the SMN1 gene and two SMN2 gene copies received a one-time intravenous proposed therapeutic dose of AVXS-101 in an open label study conducted between December 2014 and 2017. Patients were followed for 2-years post-treatment for outcomes including (1) pulmonary interventions; (2) nutritional interventions; (3) swallow function; (4) hospitalization rates; and (5) motor function. RESULTS:All 12 patients completed the study. Seven infants did not require noninvasive ventilation (NIV) by study completion. Eleven patients had stable or improved swallow function, demonstrated by the ability to feed orally; 11 patients were able to speak. The mean proportion of time hospitalized was 4.4%; the mean unadjusted annualized hospitalization rate was 2.1 (range = 0, 7.6), with a mean length of stay/hospitalization of 6.7 (range = 3, 12.1) days. Eleven patients achieved full head control and sitting unassisted and two patients were walking independently. CONCLUSIONS:AVXS-101 treatment in SMA1 was associated with reduced pulmonary and nutritional support requirements, improved motor function, and decreased hospitalization rate over the follow-up period. This contrasts with the natural history of progressive respiratory failure and reduced survival. The reduced healthcare utilization could potentially alleviate patient and caregiver burden, suggesting an overall improved quality of life following gene replacement therapy.

A peak value of ≥15 eosinophils/high power field has been defined as histologic diagnostic cutoff. Other conditions associated with esophageal eosinophilia, such as gastro-esophageal reflux disease, PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia or Crohn's disease, need to be ruled out before EoE can be diagnosed. Males are affected more frequently than females and most of the patients have concomitant allergies. Currently, the EoE prevalence is about 1 of 2,000 inhabitants in Westernized countries. The first EoE patients were described only 2 decades ago. Despite this short period, considerable progress has been made regarding the understanding of the pathophysiology, natural history, assessment of disease activity and with respect to evaluating different therapeutic options. Untreated EoE can lead to esophageal remodeling with reduced compliance and stricture formation, which represents the main risk factor for food bolus impactions. The therapeutic options can be summarized with the 3 D's, which stand for drugs, diets and dilation. Of note, as of yet, there is no EoE-specific drug that has been approved by regulatory authorities. This is, among other reasons, related to the lack of validated outcome measurement instruments until recently. Swallowed topical steroids such as budesonide or fluticasone represent the standard of care for treating symptomatic pediatric and adult EoE patients with inflammatory activity. Several trials have already evaluated different biologic therapies, such as anti-interleukin-5 or anti-IgE. Further studies are on the way. As a non-pharmacologic alternative, different dietary regimens exist. Dilation can offer long-lasting symptomatic response in case of stricturing EoE but does not have any impact on the underlying inflammation.

CONCLUSIONS:CDA type I in young adults is characterized by moderate macrocytic anemia, more severe in women, and a tendency to cholelithiasis and secondary progressive iron overload. We suggest that iron overload in this patient population should be monitored and chelation therapy initiated when indicated to prevent organ damage",

DESIGN:Retrospective case analysis. SETTING:Tertiary care pediatric medical center. PARTICIPANTS:Eight children referred for examination.

MEASUREMENTS/MAIN RESULTS:Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis was responsible for a very characteristic perinatal course in our patient cohort. All patients had hyperbilirubinemia requiring either exchange transfusions or phototherapy. Peripheral blood smears at birth revealed nucleated red blood cells, marked poikilocytosis, microcytosis, and reticulocytosis. All other pertinent laboratory studies (eg, immune hemolysis, sepsis, hereditary spherocytosis, etc) were noncontributory. Specific red blood cell membrane analysis clearly identified these patients as having hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. Follow-up evaluation of these patients (in one instance spanning 12 years) determined that this disorder is associated with a clinically apparent anemia but an excellent prognosis. CONCLUSIONS:Red blood cell membrane analysis should be performed in neonates with a hemolytic anemia requiring therapy in which no identifiable cause can be ascertained with a conventional diagnostic examination.",

Current knowledge on incidence, pathophysiology and natural history of HF in cardiomyopathies is limited, and distinct features of their therapeutic responses have not been systematically addressed. Therefore, this position paper focuses on epidemiology, pathophysiology, natural history and latest developments in treatment of HF in patients with dilated (DCM), hypertrophic (HCM) and restrictive (RCM) cardiomyopathies. In DCM, HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has high incidence and prevalence and represents the most frequent cause of death, despite improvements in treatment. In addition, advanced HF in DCM is one of the leading indications for heart transplantation. In HCM, HF with preserved ejection (HFpEF) affects most patients with obstructive, and ∼10% of patients with non-obstructive HCM. A timely treatment is important, since development of advanced HF, although rare in HCM, portends a poor prognosis. In RCM, HFpEF is common, while HFrEF occurs later and more frequently in amyloidosis or iron overload/haemochromatosis. Irrespective of RCM aetiology, HF is a harbinger of a poor outcome. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of HF in cardiomyopathies have significant implications for therapeutic decision-making. In addition, new aetiology-specific treatment options (e.g. enzyme replacement therapy, transthyretin stabilizers, immunoadsorption, immunotherapy, etc.) have shown a potential to improve outcomes. Still, causative therapies of many cardiomyopathies are lacking, highlighting the need for the development of effective strategies to prevent and treat HF in cardiomyopathies.",

AIMS:Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of acute cardiac and obstetric events in women with a cardiomyopathy during pregnancy, excluding peripartum cardiomyopathy. METHODS:In this retrospective study in a referral centre for cardiomyopathies, we included 43 consecutive pregnancies in 36 women with dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or left ventricular non-compaction. RESULTS:We observed a major cardiovascular event during 15 pregnancies (35%), including three cardiac deaths, which occurred in patients who did not follow our usual early multidisciplinary protocol. The Carpreg score was predictive of maternal complication rate (67%, 36% and 31% in women with a Carpreg score of 2, 1 and 0, respectively). However, major cardiac complications occurred in four women with no risk factors. Left ventricular ejection fraction alone, gradient in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the Zahara score and the modified World Health Organization score appeared to be less discriminant than Carpreg for maternal outcome. There were two intrauterine fetal deaths, nine premature deliveries (23%), 17 low neonatal birth weights (40%) and 11 cases of hypoglycaemia (26%). CONCLUSIONS:Pregnancy in women with a cardiomyopathy is at high risk for both women and neonates. The highest risks are observed in women who do not benefit from early multidisciplinary team management, and in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

We sought to define the characteristics, evolution, and long-term prognosis of dilated cardiomyopathy patients with mrEF at diagnosis. Methods and Results We analyzed all dilated cardiomyopathy patients consecutively evaluated in the Trieste Heart Muscle Disease Registry from 1988 to 2013. mrEF and reduced ejection fraction (rEF) were defined as baseline left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction values between 40% and 49% and <40%, respectively. All-cause mortality or heart transplantation, sudden cardiac death, or major ventricular arrhythmias were considered as outcome measures. Worsening LV ejection fraction (reduction to <40%) during follow-up was also considered to identify possible predictors of adverse remodeling. Among 812 enrolled patients, 175 (22%) presented with mrEF at presentation. At baseline, as compared with the rEF group, mrEF patients had lower rates of moderate-severe mitral regurgitation and restrictive LV filling pattern. During a median follow-up period of 120 (60-204) months, the mrEF group presented a lower rate of death/heart transplantation (9% versus 36%, P<0.001) and sudden cardiac death or major ventricular arrhythmias (4.5% versus 15%, P<0.001) than rEF patients.

Affected boys typically die from respiratory or cardiac failure. Golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is genetically homologous with DMD and causes analogous skeletal and cardiac muscle disease. Previous studies have detailed features of GRMD cardiomyopathy in mostly young dogs. Cardiac disease is not well characterized in adult GRMD dogs, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging studies have not been completed. Methods and Results We evaluated echocardiography and CMR in 24 adult GRMD dogs at different ages. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions, wall thickness, and myocardial strain were assessed with echocardiography. Features evaluated with CMR included left ventricular function, chamber size, myocardial mass, and late gadolinium enhancement. Our results largely paralleled those of DMD cardiomyopathy. Ejection fraction and fractional shortening correlated well with age, with systolic dysfunction occurring at ≈30 to 45 months. Circumferential strain was more sensitive than ejection fraction in early disease detection. Evidence of left ventricular chamber dilatation provided proof of dilated cardiomyopathy. Late gadolinium enhancement imaging showed DMD-like left ventricular lateral wall lesions and earlier involvement of the anterior septum. Multiple functional indexes were graded objectively and added, with and without late gadolinium enhancement, to give cardiac and cardiomyopathy scores of disease severity. Consistent with DMD, there was parallel skeletal muscle involvement, as tibiotarsal joint flexion torque declined in tandem with cardiac function. Conclusions This study established parallels of progressive cardiomyopathy between dystrophic dogs and boys, further validating GRMD as a model of DMD cardiac disease.",

This review focuses on sex impact on the various heart failure syndromes, including coronary artery disease, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and with reduced ejection fraction, with particular attention to dilated cardiomyopathy. Despite similar genetic predisposition in terms of identified causative mutations, other causes, such as cardiotoxic drugs exposure or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, are more prevalent in women.

Moreover, TTNtv associated with dilated cardiomyopathy are estimated to be present in 0.5% of the general population. The prognosis of asymptomatic carriers of TTNtv is poorly understood because TTNtv are associated with a highly variable phenotype. We aim to assess the natural history and clinical relevance of TTNtv by analyzing standardized mortality ratios (SMR) in multigenerational pedigrees and in close relatives of present-day patients. Methods Haplotype and genealogical analyses were performed on 3 recurrent TTNtv. Subsequently, the family tree mortality ratio method was used to compare all-cause mortality of subjects at an a priori 50% risk of carrying TTNtv to the general Dutch population. SMRs were stratified for sex, age, and calendar period. Subgroups were compared with Poisson regression. Similarly, SMRs were calculated in parents of 128 present-day dilated cardiomyopathy probands with TTNtv using the reverse parent-offspring method. Results The TTNtv were established as founder mutations and traced to 18th century ancestors. In 20 522 person-years, overall mortality was not significantly increased (SMR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95-1.18; P=0.162). However, mortality was significantly increased in subjects living after 1965 (SMR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.53; P=0.009) and aged ≥60 years (SMR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.35; P=0.02). The reverse parent-offspring analysis showed overall excess mortality (SMR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.48; P=0.003), driven by subjects aged ≥60 years. Conclusions The natural history of the analyzed TTNtv shows a relatively mild disease course with significant excess mortality in elderly patients.

OBJECTIVE:This retrospective study aims to describe the radiologic signs characterizing and identifying the shrinking vestibular schwannoma. METHODS:Involution was considered to have occurred if tumor size had decreased by 2 mm or more on its largest diameter. All magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed for tumor size, internal auditory meatus size, and tumor characteristics. Volumetric measurements were performed on the first and last scan. Audiometric data were collected at the first and last visit. RESULTS:Fourteen patients with a confirmed spontaneous regression were included, with a mean follow-up of 5 ± 2.6 years. The mean shrinkage rate was 0.9 ± 0.59 mm/year on 2D measurements, and 0.2 ± 0.17 cm3/year on volumetric measurements, with a relative shrinkage of 40 ± 16.9%. Two remarkable radiologic features were observed: First, a festooned aspect, defined by multiple curves in the tumor outline, noticed in 12 cases (86%); second, the appearance of cerebrospinal fluid filling the internal auditory meatus, associated with an enlargement of the internal auditory meatus compared to the contralateral side, and observed in 10 out of 13 cases with internal auditory meatus invasion (77%).

These antibodies are usually present in the serum but their detection is difficult, requiring a radio-immunological technique which remains uncommon. The fixed antibodies are detected more easily and more constantly in the kidney tissue than in the lung; they appear on a kidney biopsy in the form of linear deposits of immunoglobulins on the basement membrane. Thus, the renal biopsy appears to be the essential requirement to establish a diagnosis of Goodpasture's syndrome, and one should not hesitate to perform a biopsy in the presence of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage without an evident aetiology and even in the absence of any biological evidence of renal disease. Alveolar lavage may be used to confirm a haemorrhage which has been purely alveolar. The treatment for respiratory and renal recovery, using immunological therapy includes corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs and plasmapheresis. The exact methods are not yet fully defined during the course on certain clinical forms of the disease: for oliguric patients, dialysis is the single treatment; the isolated pulmonary forms have often been treated and improved by corticotherapy alone.

Contrary to beliefs held 20 years ago, we do not possess a unique satisfying explanation for the induction, maintenance, and resolution of nephrotic edema, and many concepts firmly established as ""classic"" are now being revised or reconsidered. These include the relationship between urinary protein losses and hypoalbuminemia, which is complicated by several factors such as daily protein intake, albumin catabolism, and the possible role of albumin loss at extrarenal sites. The influence of lowered plasma albumin on the decrease in plasma volume is also quite complex, due to technical difficulties in measuring plasma volume and turnover of radio-labeled albumin. The most contentious areas are how sodium and water retention are initiated and maintained and the relationship between hypoalbuminemia, plasma oncotic pressure, and edema. While aldosterone excretion and plasma concentrations are elevated in nephrotic patients, data on the renin-angiotensin system are controversial and the renal handling of sodium is related to a host of factors including glomerular filtration rate, altered proximal tubular reabsorption, and the role of vasodilators or vasoconstrictors. The complications of nephrotic syndrome are protean and relatively common. Among those are acute renal failure, thrombosis, infections, and hyperlipidemia. Since the introduction of percutaneous biopsy, the spectrum of lesions underlying nephrotic syndrome has widened considerably, the most common being minimal change, especially in children.

Serial short-axis two-dimensional echocardiograms were recorded in 11 closed chest dogs before coronary occlusion and 10, 30, 60, 180 and 360 minutes after permanent coronary ligation. Radiolabeled microsphere-derived blood flows were obtained in each study period and the histochemical (triphenyltetrazolium chloride) extent of infarction was determined at 6 hours. Previously published methods were used to quantitate field by field (every 16.7 ms) excursion of 36 evenly spaced endocardial targets. The circumferential extent of abnormal wall motion was followed sequentially using previously published definitions of abnormality: 1) systolic fractional radial change of less than 20%; 2) dyskinesia (systolic bulging) at the point in time (echocardiographic field) in which there is maximal dyskinesia; and 3) correlation with composite normal ray motion falling outside the 95% confidence limits defined in the control period. On the basis of the triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining pattern, the ventricle was divided into five zones: central infarct zone, zone with greater than 25% transmural infarction, total infarct zone, border zones and normal zone. Mean systolic fractional radial change was calculated for each zone and used as an index of the magnitude of abnormal wall motion. Regardless of the definition of abnormality employed, the circumferential extent of abnormal wall motion manifested at 10 minutes after occlusion did not significantly change, even up to 6 hours later. Similarly, 10 minutes after coronary occlusion the three infarct zones and border zones demonstrated significantly reduced systolic fractional radial change. This remained stable over the remainder of the 6 hour study period. It is concluded that once established at 10 minutes after coronary occlusion, the circumferential extent and magnitude of abnormal wall motion do not significantly change in the immediate postinfarct (6 hour) period.",

The insulin resistance in several syndromic forms of extreme insulin resistance has been shown to be caused by mutations in the receptor gene. We studied 8 female patients with the type A form of extreme insulin resistance and 3 patients (2 male and 1 female) with the Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome and followed the natural history of these patients for up to 30 years. The 11 patients ranged in age from 7 to 32 years at presentation. All 11 patients had extreme insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, and hyperandrogenism in the female patients, and all but 1 were of normal body weight. This phenotype strongly predicts mutations in the insulin receptor: of the 8 patients studied, 7 were found to have mutations. Similar results from the literature are found in other patients with type A and Rabson-Mendenhall syndromes and leprechaunism. The hyperandrogenic state resulting from hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in these patients was extreme: 6 of 8 patients had ovarian surgery to correct the polycystic ovarian syndrome and elevation of serum testosterone. By contrast, a larger group of insulin-resistant patients who were obese with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans (HAIR-AN syndrome) did not have a high probability of mutations in the insulin receptor. The morbidity and mortality of these patients were high: 3 of 11 died, 9 of 11 were diabetic and 1 had impaired glucose tolerance, and 7 of 9 patients had 1 or more severe complication of diabetes. Our literature review revealed that the mortality of leprechaunism is so high that the term leprechaunism should be restricted to infants or young children under 2 years of age. Analogous to patients with the common forms of type 2 diabetes, these patients had a heterogeneous course. In 2 patients who were able to maintain extremely high endogenous insulin production, the fasting blood glucose remained normal even though post-glucose-challenge levels were elevated. Most patients, however, required large doses of exogenous insulin to ameliorate the severe hyperglycemia. Preliminary results of a recent study suggest that recombinant leptin administration may benefit these patients with severe insulin resistance.",

In the absence of inflammatory (post-contrast enhancing) lesions on MRI cognitive function is considered spared, but some form of cognitive dysfunction may nevertheless be present. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to characterize cognitive functioning of ALD men with no or minimal MRI abnormalities, which will define cognitive functioning in this category of patients. METHODS:A neuropsychological battery covering a broad range of cognitive domains, including language, verbal and non-verbal memory, visuoconstruction, executive functioning, and psychomotor speed, was used. Means and proportions of borderline and impaired T scores ≤36 were compared to the standardized norm group and a qualitative case-by-case analysis was performed for participants with T scores ≤36 within ≥2 domains. Patients with MRI abnormalities that were extensive (Loes score > 3) or showed enhancement post-contrast were excluded. RESULTS:Thirty-three men participated (median age 44 years, range 19-71). Mean performance on verbal fluency was poorer in patients (45.70 ± 8.85 patients vs. 50 ± 10 standardized norm group, p = 0.009), as was the percentage of borderline and impaired scores on visuoconstruction (Beery VMI: 19% patients vs. 8% standardized norm group, p = 0.02; RCFT copy: 81% patients vs. 2% standardized norm group, p < 0.0005) and mental reaction time during a complex decision task (18% patients vs. 8% standardized norm group, p = 0.055).

Neurological involvement results in severe disability and premature death, but understanding of the natural history of the disease remains limited. In this study, 32 caregivers of patients with MLD in the USA (16 with late-infantile MLD; 16 with juvenile MLD) were interviewed about their experiences of the disease. Qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts was performed to gain insights into symptom onset, the diagnostic process and disease progression, with a focus on the differences between late-infantile and juvenile MLD. RESULTS:The mean ages of patients at interview were 7.6 years and 20.7 years for individuals with late-infantile and juvenile MLD, respectively. Patients with late-infantile MLD had a mean age of 1.5 years at symptom onset and 2.6 years at diagnosis. The most common initial symptoms in this group related to problems with gross motor function (12/16 patients); 11 patients never learned to walk independently. For patients with juvenile MLD, the mean ages at symptom onset and diagnosis were 8.7 years and 11.6 years, respectively. Cognitive or social/behavioural problems were the most common first reported symptoms in this group (9/16 and 7/16 patients, respectively); these were generally followed by deterioration in motor function. The rate of functional decline was more rapid in patients with late-infantile MLD than those with juvenile MLD; the mean time from first symptom to first functional loss was 1 year versus 6.1 years, respectively. Nine patients with juvenile MLD and three with late-infantile MLD had undergone a haematopoietic stem cell transplant; outcomes following transplant were variable. CONCLUSIONS:Our data highlight clear overall differences in symptom profiles and disease progression between late-infantile and juvenile MLD, but also indicate some degree of interindividual variability within each subtype. These findings are broadly consistent with previously published descriptions of MLD and enhance our knowledge of the natural history of the disease, which ultimately should help to improve patient care and aid assessments of the effectiveness of disease-related interventions in the future.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS:In a open, uncontrolled, retrospective analysis, 49 MSK patients with nephrolithiasis without renal tubular acidosis, underwent a complete metabolic evaluation and received potassium citrate therapy 4-6 g/day. The course of stone disease before and after citrate therapy was determined in each patient from a combination of clinical history, past records, radiographs and kidney ultrasound. The rate of new stone formation/pt/yr, of endourological and extracorporeal procedures, of urinary tract infection (UTI) and number of hospitalization before and after medical treatment were calculated. RESULTS:Metabolic anomalies (hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, hyperuricuria and hyperoxaluria) were present in 83% of the patients. Follow-up before and after alkali citrate therapy was comparable (4.7+/-1.4 and 4.9+/-1.7 years respectively). Medical treatment significantly reduced rates of stone formation from 2.0+/-1.0 to 0.2+/-0.5 pt/yr, ureteroscopy (URS) from 0.9+/0.8 to 0.4+/-0.5 pt/yr, extratracoporeal lithotripsy (ESWL) from 1.1+/-0.8 to 0.4+/-0.6 pt/yr, urinary tract infections (UTIs) from 0.8+/-1.2 to 0.3+/-0.5 pt/yr and hospitalization from 1.1+/-0.6 to 0.2+/-0.3 pt/yr, p < 0.001.

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions.",

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]",

RECENT FINDINGS:The introduction of next-generation sequencing technology has led to better understanding of the genetic cause of osteogenesis imperfecta and enabled cost-effective and timely diagnosis via expanded gene panels and exome or genome sequencing. Clinically, despite genetic heterogeneity, different forms of osteogenesis imperfecta share similar features that include connective tissue and systemic manifestations in addition to bone fragility. Thus, the goals of treatment in osteogenesis imperfecta extend beyond decreasing the risk of fracture, to include the maximization of growth and mobility, and the management of extraskeletal complications. The standard of care in pediatric patients is bisphosphonates therapy. Ongoing preclinical studies in osteogenesis imperfecta mouse models and clinical studies in individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta have been instrumental in the development of new and targeted therapeutic approaches, such as sclerostin inhibition and transforming growth factor-β inhibition.

Enhanced bone resorption is a recurrent histological feature of FD and a major cause of fragility of affected bones. Previous work suggests that increased bone resorption in FD is driven by RANKL and some studies have shown that the anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody, denosumab, reduces bone turnover and bone pain in FD patients. However, the effect of RANKL inhibition on the histopathology of FD and its impact on the natural history of the disease remain to be assessed. In this study, we treated the EF1α-Gs αR201C mice, which develop an FD-like phenotype, with an anti-mouse RANKL monoclonal antibody. We found that the treatment induced marked radiographic and microscopic changes at affected skeletal sites in 2-month-old mice. The involved skeletal segments became sclerotic due to the deposition of new, highly mineralized bone within developing FD lesions and showed a higher mechanical resistance compared to affected segments from untreated transgenic mice. Similar changes were also detected in older mice with a full-blown skeletal phenotype. The administration of anti-mouse RANKL antibody arrested the growth of established lesions and, in young mice, prevented the appearance of new ones. However, after drug withdrawal, the newly formed bone was remodelled into FD tissue and the disease progression resumed in young mice. Taken together, our results show that the anti-RANKL antibody significantly affected the bone pathology and natural history of FD in the mouse. Pending further work on the prevention and management of relapse after treatment discontinuation, our preclinical study suggests that RANKL inhibition may be an effective therapeutic option for FD patients. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

French physicians from the OSCAR network have been asked to fill out questionnaires collecting molecular and clinical data for 27 patients issued from 17 unrelated families. All patients showed short stature (mean = -3.5 SD) which was more severe in females (P = .006). The mean fracture rate was moderate (0.21 per year), with four fractures in total average. About 75% underwent at least one surgery, with an average number of 2.1 interventions per patient. About 50% required non-invasive assisted ventilation due to sleep apnea (67%). About 29% showed psychomotor difficulties and 33% needed a school assistant or adapted schooling. No patient had any psychological evaluation or follow-up. Molecular data were available for 14 families. Growth hormone administration was efficient on linear growth in 40% of cases.

METHODS:A PubMed search was undertaken to evaluate recent SCFE literature. A convenience sample of articles were selected and summarized. RESULTS:Most slips appear well tolerated long-term with ∼5% resulting in total hip arthroplasty (THA) at 20-year follow-up. Classic data reveals poor outcomes following closed reduction for treatment of SCFE. Improvements in intraoperative fluoroscopy and avoidance of pin penetration have reduced the rates of chondrolysis. Unfortunately, avascular necrosis remains a known risk in patients, occurring in 15% to 50% of patients following acute, unstable slips. This is the most common cause of THA in patients with SCFE. Rate of THA due to degenerative arthritis secondary to SCFE is more difficult to determine and occurs at a later age. Although realignment procedures to address anatomic abnormalities from SCFE have increased in popularity, it is unclear if this prevents degenerative arthritis and subsequently reduces the rate of THA. SCFE patients face an increased risk of disability and death due to their underlying medical comorbidities. Interventions for weight loss, blood pressure management, and lifestyle adjustments should be considered at the time of SCFE diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:SCFE remains a challenging and common condition for pediatric orthopedists. Although innovative techniques have been proposed, long-term outcome data still supports in situ pinning for stable slips, and in situ pinning with capsular decompression for unstable slips to minimize the risk of avascular necrosis.",

Concerningly, case reports have described poor skeletal outcomes associated with pregnancy in women with fibrous dysplasia. METHODS:Thirty-nine women with fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome were evaluated as part of a natural history study. Clinical, radiographic, and biochemical data were reviewed. Women were contacted to obtain detailed menstrual and reproductive histories. RESULTS:Abnormal uterine bleeding affected 77% of women (30/39), and was associated with severe anemia requiring blood transfusion in 3 cases. Nine women underwent hysterectomy for management of bleeding, including 67% (6/9) at the unusually young age of less than age 35 years. Infertility affected 43% of women (9/21), including 2 women who developed primary ovarian insufficiency after undergoing surgical treatment of ovarian cysts.

Despite this progress, there is still a need to explore new therapeutic options.Area covered: Here, we review the literature about the role of therapeutic sphingolipids in inflammatory bowel disease patients.Expert opinion: Despite the great increase of treatment options in the last 20 years, many patients still do not respond to the induction therapy (primary non-responders) or lose response over time (secondary responders). Small-molecule drugs are a promising group of drugs with low molecular weight, an oral route of administration, and low immunogenicity offering several advantages when compared to biologics such as anti-TNFs and anti-integrins.

METHODS:IBD patients were consecutively enrolled from December 2016 to January 2018. Demographic, anthropometric and biochemical data were collected so as eating habits. Abdominal ultrasound and transient elastography were performed to evaluate the presence of NAFLD and LF respectively. RESULTS:A total of 178 consecutive patients were enrolled and included in the analysis (95 Ulcerative colitis, 83 Crohn's disease). NAFLD was detected by imaging in 72 (40.4%) patients. Comparison between patients with and without NAFLD showed no significant differences in terms of IBD severity, disease duration, location/extension, use of IBD-related medications (i.e., steroids, anti-TNFs, and immunomodulators) and surgery. NAFLD was significantly associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome [MetS; odds ratio (OR): 4.13, P = 0.001] and obesity defined by body mass index (OR: 9.21, P = 0.0002).

Summary:This review examines the current understanding of pediatric IBDU and assesses the evidence supporting IBDU as a distinctive disease entity on the spectrum of inflammatory bowel disease. Key Messages:Pediatric-onset IBDU is more common than adult-onset IBDU. Therefore, an understanding of IBDU in this age group assumes more importance. However, there remains a paucity of information and a lack of exclusive longitudinal studies on pediatric IBDU. Subsequently there is significant disparity in the reported prevalence, clinical course, reclassification trends, and treatment responses around pediatric IBDU. Therefore, it remains challenging to chart the natural history of pediatric IBDU and consequently form an accurate understanding of where pediatric IBDU sits on the spectrum of disease.",

Medical history uncovered a primary syphilitic event 20 years before. The investigation led to the diagnosis of neurosyphilis with optical involvement in a patient who did not present with any signs of secondary syphilis. Treatment with penicillin G and topical steroids resulted in significant clinical improvement and resolution of the visual loss. CONCLUSION:In the well-established natural history of syphilis, primary syphilis is almost always followed by manifestation of the secondary form, which in turn precedes a period of latency.

This heterogeneity appears to constitute the underlying cause for the focal cell hyperplasia and eventually the formation of thyroid and adrenal nodules, under the influence of growth stimulatory factors. Among the main stimulatory factors are the pituitary tropic hormones, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyrotropin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which regulate the growth and function of their respective target cells, and the insulin/insulin-like growth factor system, that, through its mitogenic effects, can stimulate the proliferation of these cells. The predominance of one or the other of these growth stimulatory factors appears to determine the natural history of thyroid and adrenal nodular disease. Thus, iodine deficiency was, in the past, the main pathogenic factor responsible, through a transient rise in TSH secretion, for the endemic nodular goiter with the characteristic colloid thyroid nodules among the inhabitants in iodine deficient areas. The correction of iodine deficiency was followed by the elimination of endemic colloid goiter and the emergence of thyroid autoimmunity. The recent epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS), or insulin resistance syndrome, has been associated with the re-emergence of nodular thyroid disease. A parallel rise in the incidence of benign, nonfunctional adrenocortical tumors, known as adrenal incidentalomas, has also been reported in association with the manifestations of the MS. It is likely that the compensatory to insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia may be responsible for the rising trend of thyroid and adrenal nodular disease in the current environment.",

Intermediate-Risk (IR: localized tumour, incomplete or no initial surgery with αFP<15,000 ng/ml) received Vinblastine-Bleomycin-Cisplatin regimen; while High-Risk (HR: αFP > 15,000 ng/ml and/or metastases) received Etoposide-Ifosfamide-Cisplatin.Fifty-seven patients with SC-GCT, aged 0-80 months (median 16), were registered between 1995 and 2005. Nineteen patients had secondary SC-GCT after FSCT. All patients received CT: 17 IR and 1 SR after reevolution; 39 HR (25 with metastases). 51 patients underwent delayed surgery, which was incomplete in 8 patients.Seventy-two percent of the secondary SC-GCT had systematic biological follow-up. αFP increasing was the first presenting sign in 80% of the cases. Patients with secondary SC-GCT had a lower median αFP level at diagnosis, were less frequently classified as HR and received less CT. The two groups with secondary vs. primary SC-GCT had a statistically similar favourable outcome (Overall Survival: 93.8% vs. 86.2%; Event-Free Survival: 89.2 vs. 78.2%; p > 0.34 and >0.32), respectively, but with less burden of therapy.SC-GCT has a good overall prognosis provided complete surgery is achieved and CT is administered to IR and HR patients. SC-GCT in patients followed by αFP after treatment for FSCT had less tumour extension than newly-diagnosed patients, probably because of earlier detection of the disease.",

During the last three decades, various experimental studies in large animals, associated with the technological advance of diagnostic imaging and fetoscopy equipment, have led to great progress in the knowledge of the pathophysiology of various congenital defects. Such knowledge applied to intrauterine correction of abnormalities has transformed the natural history of several previously fatal diseases, leading to a considerable number of survivors. Fetal intervention, such as open fetal surgery, may be indicated in meningomyelocele or in congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, and in sacrococcygeal teratoma, which lead to secondary fetal hydropsy. Besides, minimally invasive procedures using fetoscopy may have application in congenital diaphragmatic hernia, in feto-fetal transfusion, in twin pregnancies with an acardiac fetus, in the posterior urethral valve, and in hypoplasia of the cardiac chambers, with good results. Even though open fetal surgery and minimally invasive procedures are still experimental and still need to be fully validated, a correct echographic diagnosis and the patient's referral to tertiary centers providing multidisciplinary fetal care contribute to the survival of fetuses with congenital diseases of usually fatal evolution.",

The aim of the present study was to review literature concerning the benefits and outcomes of fetal intervention for these anomalies together with its limitations and controversies. RECENT FINDINGS: Only one randomized clinical trial, which compared prenatal versus postnatal treatment for congenital diaphragmatic hernia, was performed. For the other anomalies, small series were described and showed that fetal surgery drastically changes the natural history of the discussed anomalies, thus it prevents the progression of a disorder that is likely to be fatal. However, controversies exist with regard to operating timing and selection criteria of fetuses that may benefit from fetal surgery. SUMMARY: Further investigations are needed with regard to the definition of appropriate operating timing and standardization of selection criteria. Multicenter randomized trials are also necessary in order to define whether fetal surgery is associated with better outcomes as compared with postnatal treatment.",

METHODS:This was a prospective case-control study. The inclusion criteria were diamniotic (monochorionic or dichorionic) twin pregnancies in the third trimester with negative serological results for infectious diseases; absence of major fetal abnormalities or twin-twin transfusion syndrome; and no history of administration of corticosteroids in this pregnancy. The control group (CG) included uncomplicated twin pregnancies, and the preeclampsia group (PEG) included twin gestations with clinical and laboratory confirmation of the disease according to well-established criteria. Samples of the decidua were obtained and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of dNK cells and interleukins (ILs) 10, 12 and 15. In addition, maternal serum samples were collected to determine the levels of these interleukins. RESULTS:Thirty twin pregnancies were selected: 20 in the control group (CG) and 10 in the preeclampsia group (PEG). The PEG showed strong placental immunostaining for IL-15 (p=0.001) and high maternal serum levels of IL-10 (22.7 vs. 11.9 pg/mL, p=0.024) and IL-15 (15.9 vs. 7.4 pg/mL, p=0.024). CONCLUSION:A higher maternal serum concentration of both pro- and anti-inflammatory factors was observed in the twin pregnancies in the PEG. However, no difference in placental expression of IL-10 was found between the groups. These findings may suggest that maternal attempts to balance these interleukins were not sufficient to cause a placental response, and this failure may contribute to the development of preeclampsia.",

METHODS:This was a cohort study of MCDA twin pregnancies that had their routine antenatal care from the first trimester at St George's Hospital, London, UK. Pregnancies had ultrasound examinations every 2 weeks at 16-24 weeks and then every 2-3 weeks until delivery. The diagnostic criteria for sFGR were estimated fetal weight (EFW) of one twin < 10th centile and intertwin EFW discordance ≥ 25%. We also applied other diagnostic criteria reported in a recent Delphi consensus. Pregnancies in which the diagnosis of TTTS was made before that of sFGR were not included in the analysis. Pregnancies that underwent fetal intervention for sFGR were excluded. The incidence of sFGR was compared between the different diagnostic criteria, overall and according to gestational age at onset. In all subsequent analyses, cases of sFGR included those diagnosed according to any of the criteria. The Gratacós classification of sFGR was applied (Type I, II or III). Pregnancy outcomes included miscarriage, intrauterine death, neonatal death and admission to the neonatal unit. Comparisons between groups were carried out using the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables and the chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS:The analysis included 287 MCDA twin pregnancies. According to the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology diagnostic criteria, the incidence of early (< 24 weeks) sFGR was 4.9%, while that of late sFGR was 3.8%. When applying the various diagnostic criteria, the incidence of early sFGR varied from 1.7% to 9.1% and that of late sFGR varied from 1.1% to 5.9%. In early-onset cases, the incidence of Type I sFGR was 80.8%, that of Type II was 15.4% and that of Type III was 3.8%. The corresponding figures in late-onset cases were 94.4%, 5.6% and 0%. The incidence of superimposed TTTS was 26.9% in cases affected by early-onset sFGR and 5.6% in those affected by late-onset sFGR. The incidence of perinatal death was 8.0% in early-onset sFGR and 5.6% in late-onset sFGR (P = 0.661). Admission to the neonatal unit occurred in 61.0% and 52.9% of cases, respectively (P = 0.484). CONCLUSIONS:In MCDA twin pregnancies, early-onset sFGR is slightly more common than is late-onset sFGR, although this difference was not significant, and is associated with worse perinatal outcome. The incidence of Types II and III sFGR is higher in early-onset sFGR. The incidence also varies according to the diagnostic criteria used, which supports the use of standardized international diagnostic criteria. Superimposed TTTS is more common in early- than in late-onset sFGR. Copyright © 2019 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

RESULTS:A total of 30 MCDA twin pregnancies with expectantly managed stage I TTTS were identified. Of these, eight (26.7%) progressed to higher stage TTTS. Median gestational age (GA) at diagnosis for those that progressed was 18.9 ± 2.9 weeks versus 21.4 ± 3.4 weeks in those that remained stable (p = 0.06). Presence of an arterioarterial (A-A) anastomosis was assessed for 20/30 patients, and eight A-A were identified. Of those, 7/8 (87.5%) remained stable. In the complete cohort, a tiny or transiently visible bladder was noted in seven donor twins. Of these, 4/7 (57.1%) progressed. Excluding one termination, 47/58 (81.0%) fetuses survived. CONCLUSION:With expectant management of stage I TTTS, nearly three-fourths of pregnancies remain stable and most have survival of ≥ 1 twin. A-A anastomoses were not associated with progression to higher stage TTTS, whereas earlier GA at diagnosis or a small or intermittently visible donor bladder may herald greater risk of progression.",

After initial consultation, two patients terminated and one was lost to follow-up, resulting in a final study population of 33. Group A had 10 patients (30.3%) and Group B had 23 patients (69.7%). In Group A, nine of the 10 were expectantly managed, resulting in a median gestational age (GA) at delivery of 34.7 (18.0-36.4) weeks, a 30-day perinatal survival of at-least-one twin of 88.9% (8/9), and dual 30-day survivors in 8/9 (88.9%).

Many patients with wandering spleen are asymptomatic, hence the condition can be discovered only by abdominal examination or at a hospital emergency department if a patient is admitted to hospital because of severe abdominal pain, vomiting or obstipation. METHODS: This article aims to provide a historical overview of wandering spleen diagnostics and surgical treatment supplemented with an analyses of articles on wandering spleen included in the PubMed database. RESULTS: One of the first clinical descriptions of a wandering spleen was written by Józef Dietl in 1854. The next years of vital importance are 1877 when A. Martin conducted the first splenectomy and in 1895 when Ludwik Rydygier carried out the first splenopexy to immobilize a wandering spleen. Since that time various techniques of splenectomy and splenopexy have been developed. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing medical technologies was a watershed in the development and treatment of wandering spleen, which is confirmed by the PubMed database. Despite the increased number of publications medical literature shows that a wandering spleen still remains a misdiagnosed condition, especially among children.",

Autosomic dominant inheritance is present in most cases but in CINCA/NOMID syndrome where neomutations are more common. Mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin, NLRP3, are associated with deregulation of caspase-1 activity, excessive interleukin-1 production and an autoinflammatory syndrome, which in familial cold urticaria and Muckle-Wells syndrome may be triggered or worsened by exposure to coldness. More and more mutations are described and even somatic mutations that can explain some clinical signs beginning in adulthood. Patients disclose a pseudo-urticarial rash, arthralgia, headaches, sometimes fever, biological inflammation but also, in severe forms of the disease, neurologic inflammation with central deafness, ophthalmologic inflammation, chronic meningitis. Some CINCA/NOMID patients also develop growth cartilage pseudo-tumoral hypertrophy. Natural disease history is usually benign in familial cold urticarial but severe in the other forms, particularly regarding neuro-sensorial involvement. In addition, secondary AA amyloidosis may develop in all forms in the absence of control of chronic inflammation. Anti-interleukin-1 treatment with anakinra, rilonacept or canakinumab induces in most cases complete remission, however sequelae may be present, particularly if central deafness or cartilage bone hypertrophy have already developed.

Methods: Women currently enrolled in natural history protocols (NCT00059748, and/or NCT00069329 under IND) who have been pregnant were included. Subjects underwent a structured, standardized interview with regards to maternal health, pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Medical records were reviewed. Results: Nine women (four with FCAS, one with MWS and four with NOMID) reported one to four pregnancies, each resulting in a total of fifteen FCAS, three MWS, and six NOMID pregnancies. Six births from FCAS mothers and three births from NOMID mothers occurred while patients were receiving anakinra. If a woman became pregnant while taking anakinra, the pre-pregnancy anakinra dose was continued. Anakinra dose was increased during one twin pregnancy. No preterm births or serious complications of pregnancy were observed. One fetus of the twin pregnancy had renal agenesis and suffered fetal demise. Genetic testing showed the deceased twin carried the same NLRP3 c.785T>C, p.V262A mutation as the mother. The other twin is healthy and mutation negative.

We discuss the natural course of the syndrome.A series of anthropometric measurements, imaging, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and endocrine investigations to assess metabolic complications such as hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia were performed on these five patients who were followed for 1-7 years. Screening of inborn errors, karyotyping, chromosomal breakage rates and DNA mutational studies with direct sequencing of LMNA, ERCC8 and ZMPSTE24 genes were also performed.Generalized lipodystrophy was noted in all patients except for regions such as the cheeks, hands and feet. All cases had failure to thrive, microcephaly, ear dysplasia, laryngomalacia, hearing impairment, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, constipation, abnormal dentition, dermatitis/acrodermatitis enteropathica, hyperpigmentation of the skin, very low insulin-like growth factor I levels with delayed bone age, relative hypolipidemia, initial camptodactyly/joint contracture, progressive kyphoscoliosis, osteoporosis with loose joints, ventriculomegaly, and generalized organic aciduria. Other findings included inguinal hernia, hypothyroidism or persistent hyperthyrotropinemia, cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, growth hormone deficiency, cloudy cornea with congenital glaucoma, neonatal teeth, cardiac defects, basal ganglia calcification and seizure disorder. These patients with NPS did not show hyperinsulinemia or dyslipidemia. Their karyotypes were all normal, while the chromosomal breakage test showed markedly increased breakage rates in four patients.

In more severe cases, immune deficiency and recurring infections can add to disease severity. RTEL1 deficiency has recently been described as a major genetic etiology, but the molecular basis and clinical consequences of RTEL1-associated DC are incompletely characterized. We report our observations in a cohort of six patients: five with novel biallelic RTEL1 mutations p.Trp456Cys, p.Ile425Thr, p.Cys1244ProfsX17, p.Pro884_Gln885ins53X13, and one with novel heterozygous mutation p.Val796AlafsX4. The most unifying features were hypocellular BMF in 6/6 and B-/NK-cell lymphopenia in 5/6 patients. In addition, three patients with homozygous mutations p.Trp456Cys or p.Ile425Thr also suffered from immunodeficiency, cerebellar hypoplasia, and enteropathy, consistent with Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome. Chromosomal breakage resembling a homologous recombination defect was detected in patient-derived fibroblasts but not in hematopoietic compartment. Notably, in both cellular compartments, differential expression of 1243aa and 1219/1300aa RTEL1 isoforms was observed. In fibroblasts, response to ionizing irradiation and non-homologous end joining were not impaired. Telomeric circles did not accumulate in patient-derived primary cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines, implying alternative pathomechanisms for telomeric loss. Overall, RTEL1-deficient cells exhibited a phenotype of replicative exhaustion, spontaneous apoptosis and senescence. Specifically, CD34+ cells failed to expand in vitro, B-cell development was compromised, and T-cells did not proliferate in long-term culture. Finally, we report on the natural history and outcome of our patients. While two patients died from infections, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) resulted in sustained engraftment in two patients. Whether chemotherapy negatively impacts on the course and onset of other DC-related symptoms remains open at present. Early-onset lung disease occurred in one of our patients after HSCT.

Most patients in each syndrome survived to young adulthood. Patients with FA had earlier onset of cancers, need for stem cell transplant, and death; followed by DC; DBA and SDS were mildest. While FA and DC patients had markedly increased risks of cancer, AML and MDS, there were no cases of leukaemia in DBA or SDS patients. The NCI cohort provides the first direct quantitative comparison of timing and magnitude of cancer risk in the IBMFS. The findings demonstrate that both FA and DC are major cancer susceptibility syndromes. The IBMFS, historically considered paediatric disorders, have important management implications for physicians treating adult patients.",

Available single disease registries provide reliable information regarding natural history, efficacy and side effects of treatments, and contribute to the discovery of the causative genes. However, these registries could not shed light on the true incidence of the various syndromes. We, therefore, established an Israeli national registry in order to investigate the relative frequency of each of these syndromes and their complications. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were registered by their hematologists in all 16 medical centers in Israel. We included patients with Fanconi anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, dyskeratosis congenita, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and thrombocytopenia with absent radii. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients diagnosed between 1966 and 2007 were registered. Fifty-two percent were found to have Fanconi anemia, 17% severe congenital neutropenia, 14% Diamond-Blackfan anemia, 6% congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, 5% dyskeratosis congenita, 2% Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and 2% thrombocytopenia with absent radii. No specific diagnosis was made in only 2 patients. Of the thirty patients (24%) developing severe bone marrow failure, 80% had Fanconi anemia. Seven of 9 patients with leukemia had Fanconi anemia, as did all 6 with solid tumors. Thirty-four patients died from their disease; 25 (74%) had Fanconi anemia and 6 (17%) had severe congenital neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive population-based study evaluating the incidence and complications of the different inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. By far the most common disease was Fanconi anemia, followed by severe congenital neutropenia and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Fanconi anemia carried the worst prognosis, with severe bone marrow failure and cancer susceptibility. Diamond-Blackfan anemia had the best prognosis. The data presented provide a rational basis for prevention programs and longitudinal surveillance of the complications of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.",

Studying these high risk, clinically atypical seminomas (CASs)-aggressive tumors with visceral metastases and chemotherapy resistance-may provide clues to the nature of drug resistance and the origin of testicular cancers. We explored the possibility that these seminomas are a unique clinical and biologic entity with intrinsic yolk sac tumor (YST) features.We assayed available archived tissue samples (n = 22) for chemotherapy-resistance markers found in YSTs. Specifically, we analyzed tissues and clinical histories from patients with CASs (those who had visceral metastases and recurrent disease), classical seminomas, and mixed germ-cell tumors containing YST. By using immunohistochemical testing, we evaluated the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2, alpha fetoprotein, and glutathione S-transferase (pi) [GST (pi)].GST (pi) expression significantly predicted for overall survival (p = .036). In addition, according to the results of GST (pi) immunohistochemical staining, the CASs appeared to resemble YSTs more than they did classical seminomas (p = 0.043). Less-advanced tumors, both those that expressed GST (pi) and those that were negative for GST (pi), were more amenable to local therapies, and the patients who had those tumors had better clinical outcomes.Results from this exploratory study suggest that certain CASs that express GST (pi) are more similar to YST than they are to classical seminomas, and that GST (pi) expression may be able to be used as a prognosticator of disease-specific survival. Such CASs thus may have a unique biologic origin that differs from that of classical seminomas. Additional studies are needed to determine the natural history and therapeutic implications of these CASs.",

To date, the role of DNA methylation in the aetiology of this class of tumour has only been analysed in adult testicular forms and with respect to only a few genes. METHODS:A bank of paediatric tumours was analysed for global methylation of LINE-1 repeat elements and global methylation of regulatory elements using GoldenGate methylation arrays. RESULTS:Both germinomas and YSTs exhibited significant global hypomethylation of LINE-1 elements. However, in germinomas, methylation of gene regulatory regions differed little from control samples, whereas YSTs exhibited increased methylation at a large proportion of the loci tested, showing a 'methylator' phenotype, including silencing of genes associated with Caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the methylator phenotype of YSTs was coincident with higher levels of expression of the DNA methyltransferase, DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3B, suggesting a mechanism underlying the phenotype. CONCLUSION:Epigenetic silencing of a large number of potential tumour suppressor genes in YSTs might explain why they exhibit a more aggressive natural history than germinomas and silencing of genes associated with Caspase-8-dependent cell death might explain the relative resistance of YSTs to conventional therapy.",

Our study included 27 primary tumors and assessed the principal malignant histologic types of pediatric GCT, yolk sac tumor (YST; n = 18), and seminoma (n = 9). Analysis of Affymetrix U133A GeneChip data was performed using the statistical software environment R, including gene set enrichment analysis, with cross-validation at the RNA and protein level. Unsupervised analysis showed complete separation of YSTs and seminomas by global gene expression profiles and identified a robust set of 657 discriminatory transcripts. There was no segregation of tumors of the same histology arising at different sites or at different ages within the pediatric range. In contrast, there was segregation of pediatric malignant GCTs and adult malignant TGCTs, most notably for the YSTs. The pediatric seminomas were significantly enriched for genes associated with the self-renewing pluripotent phenotype, whereas the pediatric YSTs were significantly enriched for genes associated with a differentiation and proliferation phenotype. We conclude that histologic type is the key discriminator in pediatric malignant GCTs and that the observed clinical differences between malignant GCTs of children and adults are mirrored by significant differences in global gene expression.",

We performed a collaborative international study to delineate phenotype, natural history, variability, and genotype-phenotype correlations in more detail. We gathered information on 103 cytogenetically or molecularly confirmed affected individuals. TRPS I was present in 85 individuals (22 missense mutations, 62 other mutations), TRPS II in 14, and in 5 it remained uncertain whether TRPS1 was partially or completely deleted. Main features defining the facial phenotype include fine and sparse hair, thick and broad eyebrows, especially the medial portion, a broad nasal ridge and tip, underdeveloped nasal alae, and a broad columella. The facial manifestations in patients with TRPS I and TRPS II do not show a significant difference. In the limbs the main findings are short hands and feet, hypermobility, and a tendency for isolated metacarpals and metatarsals to be shortened. Nails of fingers and toes are typically thin and dystrophic. The radiological hallmark are the cone-shaped epiphyses and in TRPS II multiple exostoses. Osteopenia is common in both, as is reduced linear growth, both prenatally and postnatally. Variability for all findings, also within a single family, can be marked. Morbidity mostly concerns joint problems, manifesting in increased or decreased mobility, pain and in a minority an increased fracture rate. The hips can be markedly affected at a (very) young age. Intellectual disability is uncommon in TRPS I and, if present, usually mild. In TRPS II intellectual disability is present in most but not all, and again typically mild to moderate in severity. Missense mutations are located exclusively in exon 6 and 7 of TRPS1. Other mutations are located anywhere in exons 4-7. Whole gene deletions are common but have variable breakpoints. Most of the phenotype in patients with TRPS II is explained by the deletion of TRPS1 and EXT1, but haploinsufficiency of RAD21 is also likely to contribute. Genotype-phenotype studies showed that mutations located in exon 6 may have somewhat more pronounced facial characteristics and more marked shortening of hands and feet compared to mutations located elsewhere in TRPS1, but numbers are too small to allow firm conclusions.",

The overall incidence of these conditions is difficult to estimate but autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO) has an incidence of 1 in 250,000 births, and autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO) has an incidence of 1 in 20,000 births. Osteopetrotic conditions vary greatly in their presentation and severity, ranging from neonatal onset with life-threatening complications such as bone marrow failure (e.g. classic or ""malignant"" ARO), to the incidental finding of osteopetrosis on radiographs (e.g. osteopoikilosis). Classic ARO is characterised by fractures, short stature, compressive neuropathies, hypocalcaemia with attendant tetanic seizures, and life-threatening pancytopaenia. The presence of primary neurodegeneration, mental retardation, skin and immune system involvement, or renal tubular acidosis may point to rarer osteopetrosis variants, whereas onset of primarily skeletal manifestations such as fractures and osteomyelitis in late childhood or adolescence is typical of ADO. Osteopetrosis is caused by failure of osteoclast development or function and mutations in at least 10 genes have been identified as causative in humans, accounting for 70% of all cases. These conditions can be inherited as autosomal recessive, dominant or X-linked traits with the most severe forms being autosomal recessive. Diagnosis is largely based on clinical and radiographic evaluation, confirmed by gene testing where applicable, and paves the way to understanding natural history, specific treatment where available, counselling regarding recurrence risks, and prenatal diagnosis in severe forms. Treatment of osteopetrotic conditions is largely symptomatic, although haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is employed for the most severe forms associated with bone marrow failure and currently offers the best chance of longer-term survival in this group. The severe infantile forms of osteopetrosis are associated with diminished life expectancy, with most untreated children dying in the first decade as a complication of bone marrow suppression. Life expectancy in the adult onset forms is normal. It is anticipated that further understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these conditions will reveal new targets for pharmacotherapy.",

OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives were to improve our understanding of ADO clinical characteristics and to study the natural history of the disease in the largest series of patients reported to date. DESIGN AND SETTING: This study was primarily a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of individuals with a ClCN7 mutation that was conducted over a 4-yr period at a tertiary referral center and through family reunions. Longitudinal data on a subset of subjects were also studied. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We studied 311 subjects from 11 ADO families, including 62 individuals with ADO (patients with the classic clinical phenotype based on radiographs and/or biochemistry), 32 unaffected gene carriers (subjects with the gene mutation but no radiographic and/or biochemical phenotype), and 217 controls who did not harbor a ClCN7 gene mutation. Clinical data were collected through patient interviews and examinations, medical records, and/or self-reported responses on a questionnaire that was completed by all subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prevalence of fracture, osteomyelitis, visual loss, and bone marrow failure was determined. Differences in clinical manifestations were analyzed according to affected vs. carrier status, age, and underlying genotype. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of ADO subjects had at least one sequela of the disease. Gene carriers did not have an increased risk of disease manifestations, although they were found to have significant increases in bone mineral density (P < 0.05). Compared with controls, subjects with ADO had a significantly increased prevalence of fracture (84 vs. 36%; P < 0.0001) and osteomyelitis (16 vs. 0.9%; P < 0.0001). Severe fractures (defined as > or =10 fractures of any type and/or greater than one hip/femur fracture) were identified only in ADO subjects, and osteomyelitis typically occurred in the maxilla or mandible in older adults. Visual loss, which typically had its onset in childhood, and bone marrow failure occurred in 19 and 3% of ADO subjects, respectively. Adults were more likely to manifest an ADO clinical characteristic, but no definitive genotype-phenotype relationship could be concluded. Longitudinal data suggest that the ADO clinical phenotype worsens over time. CONCLUSIONS: ADO caused by mutations in the CLCN7 gene is a frequently symptomatic disease manifested by a high rate of fracture, osteomyelitis, visual loss, and occasional bone marrow failure. The sequelae of ADO, which can be identified as early as infancy, appear to worsen over time. Fracture is the most prevalent consequence of ADO, although other more severe manifestations of disease can occur and should not be confused with recessive forms of osteopetrosis, particularly when identified in early childhood.",

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions.",

Clinical sites were selected over a wide geographic range within Latin America and the Caribbean, taking into account the dynamic course of the ZIKV epidemic. METHODS:Recruitment to the PW cohort will take place in antenatal care clinics. PW will be enrolled regardless of symptoms and followed over the course of pregnancy, approximately every 4 weeks. PW will be revisited at delivery (or after miscarriage/abortion) to assess birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities according to the evolving definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). After birth, children will be followed for 2 years in the CH cohort. Follow-up visits are scheduled at ages 1-3, 4-6, 12, and 24 months to assess neurocognitive and developmental milestones. In addition, a NH cohort for the characterization of symptomatic rash/fever illness was designed, including follow-up to capture persisting health problems. Blood, urine, and other biological materials will be collected, and tested for ZIKV and other relevant arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever) using RT-PCR or serological methods.

We tested the hypothesis that EEG background abnormalities in immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome correlate with clinical signs of neurotoxicity. In addition, we describe ictal and interictal EEG patterns to better understand the natural history of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome-associated seizures. METHODS:EEGs were obtained in 19 of 100 subjects in a prospective cohort study of children and young adults undergoing CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. We classified the EEG background on a severity scale of 0 to 5 during 30-minute epochs. EEG grades were compared with neurotoxicity scored by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium scores. Descriptive analysis was conducted for ictal and interictal EEG abnormalities. RESULTS:EEG background abnormality scores correlated well with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events neurotoxicity scores (P = 0.0022) and Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium scores (P = 0.0085). EEG was better able to differentiate the severity of coma patterns compared with the clinical scores. The EEG captured electroclinical seizures in 4 of 19 subjects, 3 of whom had additional electrographic-only seizures. Seizures most often arose from posterior head regions. Interictal epileptiform discharges were focal, multifocal, or lateralized periodic discharges. No seizures or interictal epileptiform abnormalities were seen in subjects without previous clinical seizures. CONCLUSIONS:Continuous EEG monitoring is high yield for seizure detection in high-risk chimeric antigen receptor T cell patients, and electrographic-only seizures are common.

We will also review new mutations that have been identified through advancement in genetic testing, allowing for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of intestinal dysmotility and potential etiologies. RECENT FINDINGS:With the advancements in genetic testing, new mutations have been identified in the diagnosis of megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), a disorder leading to pediatric pseudo-obstruction. MYLK, LMOD1, MYL9, and MYH11 encode for various proteins within smooth muscle cells; abnormalities within these proteins lead to abnormal intestinal smooth muscle contractions. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is defined by symptoms of bowel obstruction in the absence of a lumen-occluding lesion. CIPO is a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the enteric neurons, intestinal smooth muscle, and/or the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). Symptoms can be non-specific and etiologies include both primary and secondary causes of CIPO that contribute to the delay in recognizing this condition and making the correct diagnosis. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction has been recognized in both adults and children with fundamental differences in the etiology, symptom onset, clinical features and natural history of this disorder. For this reason, it has been considered a separate entity referred to as pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction (PIPO).",

We included Buruli ulcer, cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), leptospirosis, mycetoma, myiasis, podoconiosis, snakebite, tungiasis, and soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, particularly hookworm infection and strongyloidiasis. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and Popline databases, contacted experts, and hand-searched reference lists for eligible studies. The search was conducted in English without language, publication status, or date restrictions up to January 2014. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported a measure of the association between footwear use and the risk of each NTD. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Descriptive study characteristics and methodological quality of the included studies were summarized.

Based on these findings, the natural history of tungiasis in Wistar rats was described and divided in five stages. Our data show that the natural history of tungiasis in Wistar rats and humans is almost identical, except that in the animals, the basement membrane disrupts 5 days after penetration and provokes an intense infiltration of the dermis, while in humans, the basement membrane remains intact.

The incidence of tularemia is very low with a lack of comprehensive data that describe disease in humans due to difficulty in understanding time and routes of exposure. Under the title Operation Whitecoat, researchers at Ft. Detrick, MD conducted 40 clinical studies of tularemia from 1958 to 1968. In these studies, one of the objectives was to evaluate candidate countermeasures for treatment or prophylaxis of disease after exposure to Francisella tularensis strain Schu S4 by inhalation. These studies were reviewed retrospectively to delineate the early signs and symptoms or natural history of pneumonic tularemia and examine the efficacy of tetracycline in controlled human clinical studies. Using vital signs, onset of fever was objectively defined and calculated for each subject, while Adverse Events reported after exposure were also used to define the timing of disease onset and symptoms of early disease. There was a dose response relationship between time to fever onset and exposed dose at 200 cfu (172.8 h), 700 cfu (163.2 h), 2,500 cfu (105.3 h), and 25,000 cfu (75.5 h). Onset of fever was typically the earliest sign of disease at all doses but was often accompanied by symptoms such as headache, myalgia, chest pain, and nausea, irrespective of dose except at 200 cfu where only 50% of subjects exhibited fever onset or symptoms. Examining the efficacy of different treatment regimens of tetracycline, ineffective treatments were indicated by relapse of disease (fever and Adverse Events) after cessation of antibiotic treatment. Stratification of the data suggested that treatment for <14 days or doses <2g/day was associated with increased percentage of subjects with relapse of disease symptoms. Although these types of human challenge studies would not be ethically possible now, the climate post-World War II supported human testing under rigorous conditions with informed consent. Thus, going back and analyzing these unique clinical human challenge studies has helped describe the course of infection and disease induced by a biothreat pathogen and possible countermeasures for treatment under controlled conditions.",

Ticks collected at seven sites were tested to determine the infection prevalence of F. tularensis in Dermacentor variabilis in Minnesota. Materials and Methods: Ticks were collected from two properties at an epizootic site and at five long-term tick research sites. Ticks were pooled by species, sex, date, and site with a maximum of 10 ticks per pool. Ticks were bisected and homogenized; DNA from supernatant was extracted and tested by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Twice, additional ticks were collected for bacterial culture and isolation of F. tularensis. Proportion of positive pools and minimum infection rate (MIR) were calculated. Results: A total of 3527 ticks were tested for F. tularensis including 1601 male D. variabilis and 1926 female D. variabilis. Across all sites, 128 (34%) of 378 pools were RT-PCR positive for F. tularensis. Of 128 positive pools, F. tularensis from 96 (75%) was identified as type A; F. tularensis from 32 pools was unable to be subtyped. The overall MIR was 3.6%. The MIR was significantly lower at the epizootic site compared with Morrison County 1 (3.9% vs. 7.2%; p = 0.02) but did not differ between the epizootic site and Pine County 1 (3.9% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.49).

Three environmental MSSA and three environmental MRSA are selected for proteomic profiling using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation tandem mass spectrometry (iTRAQ MS/MS). Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotation are applied to interpret the functions of the proteins detected. 792 proteins are identified in MSSA and MRSA. Comparative analysis of MRSA and MSSA reveals that 8 of out 792 proteins are upregulated and 156 are downregulated. Proteins that have differences in abundance are predominantly involved in catalytic and binding activity. Among 164 differently abundant proteins, 29 are involved in pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, stress response, mismatch repair, and cell wall synthesis. Twenty-two proteins associated with pathogenicity including SPA, SBI, CLFA, and DLT are upregulated in MRSA.

OBJECTIVE:To retrospectively study outcome of conservative treatment in patients with low output (<200 ml/day) EPF with DPDS following percutaneous or surgical intervention in acute necrotising pancreatitis (ANP). METHODS:The data of patients of low output EPF with DPDS treated conservatively in our unit over last 5 years was retrospectively analysed. Their clinical course, complications as well as time taken for fistula closure was retrieved. RESULTS:33 patients (27 males; mean age: 40.5 ± 9.3 years) of low output EPF and DPDS were studied. 31 patients developed EPF following percutaneous drainage (PCD) and 2 patients developed fistula following surgery. The drain fluid amylase ranged from 1600 to 32,000 IU/l and site of disruption was neck, proximal body and distal body in 4, 16 and 13 patients respectively.

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]",

A review of 101 patients with these concurrent diagnoses was performed. Forty-two percent of patients had 1 or more additional malignancies; none appeared to be associated with Lynch syndrome (LS). This suggests the need for careful follow-up in these patients and further study. BACKGROUND: Small studies have demonstrated that patients who have both colorectal and renal cell carcinoma may be at increased risk for the development of additional malignancies. A possible genetic basis has been suggested. Our study describes the clinicopathologic features of these patients and clarifies the relationship of this cohort with Lynch syndrome (LS). METHODS: Patients with primary CRC and RCC treated at our institution were identified. Medical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical information. Immunohistochemical staining for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was performed on tumor tissue when possible. RESULTS: During the study period, 24,642 patients were treated for CRC and 7,366 were treated for RCC at our institution. One hundred seventy-nine patients had both diagnoses, with 101 patients eligible for inclusion in our cohort. Tumors were typically early stage. The 2 cancers presented as synchronous lesions in 42% of patients. Thirty-two patients had 1 additional primary malignancy, 7 patients had 2 additional primary malignancies, and 3 patients had 3 additional primary malignancies. No patient had a family history that met the Amsterdam II criteria (AC) for LS, but 50% had family members with 1 malignancy. One of 10 colorectal tumors analyzed for the absence of MMR protein expression demonstrated the absence of MSH6, but the corresponding RCC demonstrated intact expression of all 4 MMR proteins. CONCLUSION: It is rare for patients to be diagnosed with both CRC and RCC. The clinicopathologic features of this cohort and the results of immunohistochemical analysis performed on a sample of these patients do not suggest LS. However, the high rate of additional carcinomas suggests a need for careful follow-up.

Clinical examination, radiographic findings, and natural history.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8829034,"Numerous clinical features of hallux limitus/rigidus have been previously reported as isolated entities based on individual case review or myopic observations. Few attempts have been made to synthesize a comprehensive natural history which correlates the inter-relationship of these findings. Frequently unrecognized or overlooked subtle clinical findings, such as shoe-wear patterns, hyperkeratoses locations, and gait disturbances, precede significant radiographic changes or painful degenerative arthritis by months to years. Recognition of these subtle clinical features will aid in establishing an early and accurate diagnosis, and provide the physician with an opportunity to institute treatment prior to the need for surgical reconstruction. Several conclusions can be made regarding the natural history of hallux rigidus. 1. Predisposing factors (pes planovalgus, uncompensated varus) lead to spastic contracture of the hallux (hallux equinus). 2. A shift in the axis of movement occurs within the first metatarsophalangeal joint, from centrally within the metatarsal head to plantarly at the level of the sesamoidophalangeal ligament. 3. Dorsal articular impingement of the proximal phalangeal base on the metatarsal head leads to either a chronic erosion of the dorsal metatarsal head (chondritis dissecans), or fracture through the subchondral bone plate (osteochondritis dissecans). 4. Progressive degenerative arthritis within the first metatarsophalangeal joint appears as joint space narrowing, dorsal osteophyte proliferation, subchondral cyst formation and sclerosis, and articular flattening. 5. Synovial effusion produces periarticular pain, resulting in chronic splinting of the hallux. 6. Auto-fusion of the metatarsophalangeal joint represents the end-stage progression of hallux rigidus. In addition to degeneration of the metatarsophalangeal joint, sesamoid degeneration further compounds joint immobility. 1. Sesamoid immobility from chronic spasm leads to traction proliferation of the sesamoid bones (hypertrophy). 2. Disuse osteopenia of the sesamoids is an indication of sesamoid-metatarsal degeneration, and parallels degenerative changes of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. 3. Proximal sesamoid retraction reflects the degree of hallux equinus. Metatarsus primus elevatus is a co-existant feature of hallux limitus and hallux rigidus. 1. Primary metatarsus primus elevatus is encountered in patients with a more proximal level of uncompensated varus, with hallux equinus occurring secondarily in an attempt to provide medial column support. 2. Secondary metatarsus primus elevatus results from the retrograde effects of hallux equinus on the first metatarsal, and occurs in patients with pes planovalgus. 3. Flexor stabilization syndrome of the hallux occurs in patients with pes planovalgus, and is analogous to a flexor stabilization hammertoe of the lesser digits. 4. Differentiation between primary and secondary metatarsus primus elevatus is made by evaluation of weight-bearing radiographs, comparing the standard lateral radiograph to a lateral radiograph using a forefoot block test, in which the digits are suspended off of the weight-bearing surface.",

Females with LGMD2B/LGMD-R2-dysferlin-related had less severe progression to handicap than males and LGMD2A/LGMD-R1-calpain3-related patients with truncating variants had earlier disease onset and more severe progression to handicap than patients without truncating variants. We have provided paramount epidemiological data of LGMD2/LGMD-R in Brazil that might help on differential diagnosis, better patient care and guiding future collaborative clinical trials and natural history studies in the field.",

To facilitate transition from drug discovery to clinical trials, standardized procedures and natural disease history data were collected for these mouse models. Implementing the TREAD-NMD standardized operating procedures, we here subjected LGMD2D (SGCA-null), LGMD2F (SGCD-null) and wild type (C57BL/6J) mice to five functional tests from the age of 4 to 32 weeks. To assess whether the functional test regime interfered with disease pathology, sedentary groups were taken along. Muscle physiology testing of tibialis anterior muscle was performed at the age of 34 weeks. Muscle histopathology and gene expression was analysed in skeletal muscles and heart. Muscle histopathology and gene expression was analysed in skeletal muscles and heart. Mice successfully accomplished the functional tests, which did not interfere with disease pathology. Muscle function of SGCA- and SGCD-null mice was impaired and declined over time. Interestingly, female SGCD-null mice outperformed males in the two and four limb hanging tests, which proved the most suitable non-invasive tests to assess muscle function. Muscle physiology testing of tibialis anterior muscle revealed lower specific force and higher susceptibility to eccentric-induced damage in LGMD mice. Analyzing muscle histopathology and gene expression, we identified the diaphragm as the most affected muscle in LGMD strains. Cardiac fibrosis was found in SGCD-null mice, being more severe in males than in females. Our study offers a comprehensive natural history dataset which will be useful to design standardized tests and future pre-clinical studies in LGMD2D and 2F mice.",

The correlation and the prognostic impact of respiratory and heart impairment are poorly described. We aimed to describe the long-term cardiac and respiratory follow-up of these patients and to determine predictive factors of cardio-respiratory events and mortality in LGMD 2C and 2D. METHODS:We reviewed the charts of 34 LGMD patients, followed from 2005 to 2015, to obtain echocardiographic, respiratory function and sleep recording data. We considered respiratory events (acute respiratory failure, pulmonary sepsis, atelectasis or pneumothorax), cardiac events (acute heart failure, significant cardiac arrhythmia or conduction block, ischemic stroke) and mortality as outcomes of interest for the present analysis. RESULTS:A total of 21 patients had type 2C LGMD and 13 patients had type 2D. Median age was 30 years [IQR 24-38]. At baseline, median pulmonary vital capacity (VC) was 31% of predicted value [20-40]. Median maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) was 31 cmH2O [IQR 20.25-39.75]. Median maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) was 30 cm H2O [20-36]. Median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 55% [45-64] with 38% of patients with LVEF <50%. Over a median follow-up of 6 years, we observed 38% respiratory events, 14% cardiac events and 20% mortality. Among baseline characteristics, LVEF and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) were associated with mortality, whilst respiratory parameters (VC, MIP, MEP) and the need for home mechanical ventilation (HMV) were associated with respiratory events. CONCLUSION:In our cohort of severely respiratory impaired type 2C and 2D LGMD, respiratory morbidity was high. Cardiac dysfunction was frequent in particular in LGMD 2C and had an impact on long-term mortality. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02501083.",

However, until recently, the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of these conditions had hampered our abilities to recognize individual disease complications, especially in the rarer forms. Over the years the improved understanding of the molecular defects responsible for several of these forms has also allowed recognition of the associated cardiac complications. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been significant new findings regarding the understanding of the type, progression and pathogenesis of the cardiac involvement found in a number of muscular dystrophies. The natural history of cardiac involvement in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy was described in detail by different studies. Novel non-invasive techniques to assess early cardiac involvement were reported in patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies; improved understanding of the pattern and pathogenesis of cardiac involvement of sarcoglycanopathies was reported, together with the description of the cardiac involvement in forms of limb girdle muscular dystrophies secondary to abnormal glycosylation. Therapeutic intervention strategies for each individual condition were also proposed. SUMMARY: Our understanding of the incidence, type and pathogenesis of the molecular basis for cardiac involvement in different muscular dystrophies has improved significantly over the last year.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in PA patients and factors associated with CKD in PA are not known. METHODS:Thirty-one subjects diagnosed with PA underwent laboratory and clinical evaluations through a dedicated natural history study at the National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02890342). RESULTS:Cross-sectional analysis of the creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in subjects with native kidneys revealed an age-dependent decline in renal function (P < 0.002). Among adults with PA, 4/8 (50%) had eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. There was a significant discrepancy between eGFRs calculated using estimating equations based on serum creatinine compared with serum cystatin C (P < 0.0001). The tubular injury marker, plasma lipocalin-2, and plasma uric acid were strongly associated with CKD (P < 0.0001). The measured 24-hour creatinine excretion was below normal, even after adjusting for age, height, and sex. CONCLUSION:CKD is common in adults with PA and is associated with age. The poor predictive performance of standard eGFR estimating equations, likely due to reduced creatine synthesis in kidney and liver, could delay the recognition of CKD and management of ensuing complications in this population.",

Although liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a bulk enzyme-replacement strategy to stabilize metabolically fragile patients, it is not a metabolic cure because patients remain at risk for disease-related complications. We retrospectively studied LT and/or liver-kidney transplant in 9 patients with PA or MMA with additional focus on the optimization of metabolic control and management in the perioperative period. Metabolic crises were common before transplant. By implementing a strategy of carbohydrate minimization with gradual but early lipid and protein introduction, lactate levels significantly improved over the perioperative period (P < 0.001). Posttransplant metabolic improvement is demonstrated by improvements in serum glycine levels (for PA; P < 0.001 × 10-14 ), methylmalonic acid levels (for MMA; P < 0.001), and ammonia levels (for PA and MMA; P < 0.001). Dietary restriction remained after transplant. However, no further metabolic crises have occurred.

RESULTS:The average age at initial evaluation and treatment was significantly younger in patients ascertained via abnormal NBS compared with those referred for clinical symptoms. Furthermore, the majority of individuals ascertained because of abnormal NBS were asymptomatic at diagnosis, compared with a minority of clinical presentations.

METHODS:Cross-sectional anthropometric and body-composition measurements were correlated with diet content and disease-related biomarkers in 61 patients with isolated MMA (46 mut, 9 cblA, and 6 cblB). RESULTS:Patients with MMA tolerated close to the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of complete protein (mut(0): 99.45 ± 32.05% RDA).

Although arthritis is the cardinal symptom, many extra-articular manifestations can occur. Lung involvement and particularly interstitial lung disease (ILD) is among the most common. Although ILD can occur as part of the natural history of RA (RA-ILD), pulmonary fibrosis has been also linked with methotrexate (MTX); a condition also known as MTX-pneumonitis (M-pneu). This review aims to discuss epidemiological, diagnostic, imaging and histopathological features, risk factors, and treatment options in RA-ILD and M-pneu. M-pneu, usually has an acute/subacute course characterized by cough, dyspnea and fever. Several risk factors, including genetic and environmental factors have been suggested, but none have been validated. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiologic findings which are mostly consistent with non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), more so than bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Histological findings include interstitial infiltrates by lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils with or without non-caseating granulomas. Treatment requires immediate cessation of MTX and commencement of glucocorticoids. RA-ILD shares the same symptomatology with M-pneu. However, it usually has a more chronic course. RA-ILD occurs in about 3-5% of RA patients, although this percentage is significantly increased when radiologic criteria are used. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and NSIP are the most common radiologic patterns. Several risk factors have been identified for RA-ILD including smoking, male gender, and positivity for anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies and rheumatoid factor. Diagnosis is based on clinical and radiologic findings while pulmonary function tests may demonstrate a restrictive pattern. Although no clear guidelines exist for RA-ILD treatment, glucocorticoids and conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like MTX or leflunomide, as well as treatment with biologic DMARDs can be effective. There is limited evidence that rituximab, abatacept, and tocilizumab are better options compared to TNF-inhibitors.",
346,GARD:0000518,Acute articular rheumatism,30725821,['Review'],Aortic Valve Replacement,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30725821,"The aortic valve is a semilunar valve with three leaflets, which lies at the junction of left ventricle and aorta. It allows unidirectional blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. Because of the highly complex and sophisticated cellular and molecular functions, the thin valve leaflet can withstand extreme mechanical and hemodynamic forces with every cardiac cycle.[1] Various factors including age and congenital defects can compromise the normal valvular function leading to a wide variety of complications.[2] Although bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are the most common congenital abnormality, congenital valve defects can range from aortic atresia (missing or incomplete closure of aortic valves) to a sub or supra-valvular stenosis. BAV is reported to have an incidence of 1 to 2% with a male predominance. Lack of microfibrillar proteins during valvulogenesis has been reported to affect the leaflet development where two leaflets are fused to form one large leaflet. It frequently correlates with aortic abnormalities such as aortic dilation (root, ascending and arch) and coarctation of the aorta.[3] The bicuspid aortic valve leaflets can undergo accelerated calcific degeneration because of abnormal hemodynamic forces. Congenital abnormalities including BAV can lead to various valvular complications including aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation leading to an increased risk to infective endocarditis, which has a reported incidence of 12 to 39% in BAV.[3] Unless severe, BAV generally remains asymptomatic till the age of 50 to 60 years. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a narrowing of the valve aperture reducing the aortic valve area. Increased resistance to blood flow and transvalvular pressure gradient causes increased left ventricle workload causing hypertrophy. Its prevalence increases with age and can be as high as 4.6% in people greater than age 75 years. Being the most common valvular disease in Europe and America, estimates are that 3.5 million people in England alone will have AS by the year 2020.[4] Calcific degeneration leading to stiffening and restriction motion of valve leaflet is the most common cause of AS. Disruption of endothelium lining on the aortic side caused by increased mechanical stress seem to be the inciting event. Posterior leaflets are reported to be affected the most.[5] Rheumatic fever causing inflammation of the leaflets is still the leading cause of AS in developing countries. AS can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms of syncope, angina and heart failure.[6] Severe AS is fatal with a 50% mortality at 2 years.[7] As per The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, AS is graded severe when the orifice area is less than 1.0 cm, the mean gradient is greater than 40 mmHg or the jet velocity is greater than 4 m/s. Prognosis is poor in symptomatic or severe cases unless the valve is replaced. Up to 30% of patients aged > 75 do not undergo surgical valve replacement either because of technical reasons; this may include porcelain aorta, general frailty, refusal to undergo surgery, and serious comorbid conditions.[8] The operative death risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is as high as 10% in patients with LV dysfunction, chronic renal disease, and advanced age.[9] Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR/TAVI) have emerged as a more feasible and less risky option for patients not suitable for surgery. Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle when the valve leaflets fail to coapt. Common causes include congenital defects, calcific degeneration, infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever, and trauma.[10][11][12][13] Ventricular hypertrophy in chronic cases accommodates increased volume to maintain the normal stroke volume and end-diastolic pressure; hence, chronic AR can be asymptomatic for decades.[14] In contrast, with acute cases of AR, ventricles do not have enough time to undergo the needed changes such as hypertrophy to accommodate increased volumes. Because of decreased stroke volume, the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output but is insufficient to meet the demand resulting in increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. On physical examination, AR murmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after the aortic component of S (A); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal intercostal space. It also has associations with various other murmurs including: “Mid-systolic murmur” because of rapid ejection of an overload of blood from the left ventricle, “Austin Flint” murmur is mid-to-late diastolic murmur due to partial closure of mitral valve during ventricular systole because of regurgitant flow from aortic valve, “Cole-Cecil” is a diastolic murmur due to the fusion of an aortic murmur with the S3 because of simultaneous filling of the left ventricle from left atrium and AR. History of valvular surgery Dr. Theodore Tuffier, in 1912, used his finger to free the fused leaflets of a stenosed aortic valve.[15] Before the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mitral valve repair involved commissurotomy through access from the left atrial chamber. Thomas Homes Sellors performed first pulmonary valvulotomy in 1948 by using a tenotomy knife.[16] Charles Hufnagel developed the first artificial valve based on a reciprocating ball and cage. It was used to prevent backflow of blood into the ventricles due to aortic insufficiency.[17] CPB machine revolutionized the valve replacement in the anatomical position. Dr. Dwight Harken and his colleagues performed the first successful aortic valve replacement. Later that year, Drs. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards performed mitral valve replacement.[18] Bioprosthetic valves are closer in function to natural valves but have a limited life expectancy, whereas, Mechanical valves are more durable but require anticoagulation. The choice of valves, among other factors, depends upon the patient’s age and well-being. Mechanical heart valves are known to last for approximately 25 years. Seventy different mechanical heart valves have been developed since 1960.[19] Ball and cage, bi-leaflet, and tilting disc are the common ones. Modification of the ball valve by Dr. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards entailed developing a cage made of lucite with a silicone elastomer ball. The cage material was later changed to stainless steel and then cobalt-chromium alloys. The Starr-Edward valve also has a Teflon sewing ring, which enabled suturing into mitral and later into the aortic position.[20]  Increased thrombogenicity has been a significant issue, for which valves underwent several modifications such as measures to reduce metal contact by covering the struts with cloth and using Silastic shields. Other issues included hemolysis due to excessive rubbing of the ball against the sewing ring and occlusion of coronary ostia because of high profile. Despite these issues, these valves showed the feasibility of prosthetic valve enabling Starr-Edwards to draw design criteria. Basic points included that the valves should be chemically inert, biocompatible, a-traumatic to blood, and non-thrombogenic.[21]  In 1965, Kay-Shiley’s non-rotating disc valve replaced the ball with a single disc but demonstrated poor hemodynamics and hemolysis and was discontinued. Bjork-Shiley in 1969 developed a tilting-disc valve, which overcame the problems with the single-disc valve. Free rotation of disc between metal struts allows it to open by tilting at a 60-degree angle. Bjork-Shiley replaced the flat with the convexo-concave disc to create a larger orifice in 1975 but were the object of a recall due to fracture of welded struts.[22]  Medtronic Hall valve developed by Dr. Karl Hall and Robert Kaster is the most common tilting disc valve. Perforation in the middle of the disc served as a guide and an improved tilting angle.[23] In 1977, St Jude Medical developed Bi-leaflet valve, which comprised two semi-circular flaps with hinges close to the center of the orifice. Stagnation of blood flow leading to thrombus formation around the hinge region was a problem with the bi-leaflet valve.[15] A newly developed valve resolved this issue with a valve in which the continuous 360-degree rotation around the central axis of the valve ensured an even distribution of blood flow and prevent thrombus formation.[16]  Predisposition for thrombosis, embolism, need for lifelong anticoagulation therapy are drawbacks of mechanical valves. Bioprosthetic valves can either be an allograft (cadaver or Ross procedure) or, a xenograft (native or pericardium). The Ross procedure involves replacing the diseased aortic valve with the patient’s own pulmonary valve (autograft) and replace the pulmonary valve with aortic or pulmonary allograft. The pulmonary autograft grows with the patient and does not induce an immunologic response. The most common xenografts are porcine aortic valves and bovine pericardial valves. Lonescu-Shiley developed xenograft valves by using bovine pericardium on a titanium stent in 1971 but was later withdrawn in 1987 due to structural failure including abrasive tears because of fabric-tissue interface and leaflet calcification. Carpentier-Edwards bovine pericardial valve overcame those issues by making some structural modifications, like stitching pericardium to the inside of the fabric and using flexible stent posts. Although biological valves have better hemodynamics compared to mechanical valves, they have a shorter lifespan because of calcification, which stiffens the valve leaflets. Tissues engineering, a field in regenerative medicine restores and maintains the function of living tissues. Skin graft for burn victims is an example. Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) are perceived to be non-thrombogenic, and infection resistant. With advancement in material science and culturing techniques, there is the possibility of a TEHV valve that is capable of growing, remodeling and repairing itself as the patients grow. Polymeric valves have been around for over 50 years, but because the earlier versions were prone to calcification and degradation, they were not widely used and instead only used in bridge devices like artificial hearts and left ventricular assist devices. Besides the advantage that they can be produced in various shapes and sizes,[17] they are known to combine the durability of mechanical valves and the hydrodynamic function of bioprosthetic valves.[18] The earliest polymeric valve implanted in a 44-year-old female in 1958 at the mitral position was a polyurethane design with Teflon chordae tendinae.[18][24] Polyurethane valves have been found to have better hemodynamics compared to bioprosthetic valves and a lower incidence of thrombogenicity than mechanical valves. With advances in material sciences, the future of polymeric valves seems promising.",

METHODS:Eighty-three patients with ATs arising from PVs from a consecutive series of 487 patients who underwent CB and RF ablation were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had a prior history of atrial fibrillation (AF) were excluded. The AT origin was confirmed during the conventional electrophysiological study and activation mapping. The ablation approach was at the discretion of the operators. RESULTS:Thirty-five patients were managed with focal ablation, 25 were ablated with unilateral PV isolation (PVI), and the remaining 23 were performed with CB ablation. All procedures were successfully ablated. There was no significant difference in procedure time between CB group and RF focal group (43.7 ± 11.8 min vs. 45.8 ± 11.2 min, P = 0.121), whereas the fluoroscopy time in CB group was longer than in RF PVI group (10.1 ± 2.5 min vs. 8.4 ± 2.8 min, P < 0.001). There was 1 recurrence in CB group, 4 recurrences of AT in RF focal group, and 2 recurrence in RF PVI group (P = 0.643). Repeat ablation was performed in 6 of 7 patients. Seventy-eight patients were available for long-term follow-up. At a mean of 5.4 ± 4.6-year follow-up, 77 of 78 patients were free from AT without antiarrhythmic medication after 1.1 ± 0.3 procedures. No patient had procedural complications and developed AF during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS:CB ablation is an effective and safe tool to treat ATs originating from the PVs. The ATs originating from the PVs represent an isolated clinical process and are not likely to be the forerunner of a more diffuse process leading to the development of PV AF.",

METHODS:Between 1990 and 2015, 1231 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement were reviewed, stratifying subjects as those with AVD (n = 363) or without AVD (NA; n = 868). Primary end points were progressive AVD (grade ≥ II) and subsequent AVR. Overall mortality and valve-related complications served as secondary end points. Propensity score matching was used for risk adjustment (n = 320 in each group). RESULTS:No differences in postoperative complications or clinical outcomes were observed between groups. The 20-year overall survival was similar (before matching: NA 86.1% vs AVD 80.8%, P = 0.128; after matching: 83.5% vs 81.1%, P = 0.425). Of the entire cohort, progressive AVD was observed in 162 patients, and significant AVD (grade ≥ III) was observed in only 60 patients. Subsequent AVR was required in 37 patients due to mitral valve (MV) dysfunction or severe aortic stenosis. The 20-year freedom from significant AVD and subsequent AVR was significantly higher in the NA group than in the AVD group before and after matching (before: NA, 96.5% vs 73.7%, P < 0.001; AVD, 98.5% vs 82.3%, P < 0.001; after: 98.1% vs 73.3%, P < 0.001; 99.3% vs 82.5%, P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:Although progressive AVD did not significantly impact long-term survival during the follow-up period, those patients qualifying initially as mild AVD may eventually progress to significant AVD after the first 5 postoperative years. Therefore, aggressive echocardiography should be performed at 5-year lapse after mitral valve replacement to determine the appropriate timing of AVR.",

Pressure overload leads to marked structural and electrical remodelling of left atrium. The frequency of persistent AF increases with age and paroxysmal, asymptomatic, AF seems even more frequent. The occurrence of AF worsens the haemodynamic tolerance of MS and markedly increases the risk of thromboembolic events. AF has a negative impact on the natural history of MS and on its outcome after commissurotomy. The respective indications of rhythm and rate control should be adapted to patient characteristics, particularly the consequences of MS, and take into account the high risk of recurrence of AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy is mandatory when AF complicates MS, regardless of its severity and CHA2DS2-VASc score. Non-vitamin K antagonists oral anticoagulants are not recommended in moderate-to-severe MS due to the lack of data. Percutaneous mitral commissurotomy does not appear to prevent the occurrence of AF in MS but should be considered as the first-line therapy when AF is associated with severe symptomatic MS, followed by the discussion of cardioversion or ablation. AF ablation should be considered in patients with mitral disease requiring intervention, but the ideal timing and techniques are difficult to determine due to the lack of appropriate specific randomised trials in patients with MS.",

Etiologies and natural history.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9068138,"Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare in childhood and little is known about the causes and outcome. This lack of information results in extrapolation of adult data to the care and management of children, who might require different treatment from that of adults. This study was undertaken retrospectively to evaluate the causes and natural history of restrictive cardiomyopathy in childhood. Twelve cases of restrictive cardiomyopathy were identified by database review of patient records from 1967 to 1994. The cases were selected on the basis of echocardiographic and cardiac catheterization criteria. Charts were reviewed for the following variables: age, sex, cause, right-and left-sided hemodynamics, pulmonary vascular resistance index, shortening fraction, therapy, and outcome. There were 6 males and 6 females with a mean age of 4.6 years at presentation (median, 3.4 yr; range, 0.9 to 12.3 yr). Etiologies included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 3 patients, cardiac hypertrophy with restrictive physiology in 3, idiopathic in 2, familial in 2 (twins), ""chronic eosinophilia"" in 1, and ""post inflammatory"" with no definitive causes in 1. At presentation the mean shortening fraction was 33% +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM), average right ventricular pressures were 44/13 +/- 3/1, average left ventricular pressures were 88/25 +/- 4/3, and the mean pulmonary vascular resistance index was 3.4 +/- 1.3 U.m2 (n = 9), but increased to 9.9 +/- 3.1 U.m2 (n = 5, p = 0.04) by 1 to 4 years after diagnosis. Four of the 12 patients had embolic events (1, recurrent pulmonary emboli; 1, saddle femoral embolus; 2, cerebrovascular accidents) and 9 of 12 died within 6.3 years despite medical therapies, which included diuretics, verapamil, propranolol, digoxin, and captopril. In conclusion, restrictive cardiomyopathy in childhood is commonly idiopathic or associated with cardiac hypertrophy, and the prognosis is poor. Embolic events occurred in 33% of our patients, and 9 of 12 patients died within 6.3 years. Within 1 to 4 years of diagnosis, patients may develop a markedly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance index; therefore, transplantation should be considered early.",

Indeed, so-called extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) are frequent and considerably affect morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of EIMs ranges from 6 to 47%. In up to one quarter of the patients, EIMs can present even before an IBD diagnosis is established. The pathophysiology of EIMs remains elusive, although data from clinical trials demonstrating anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) efficacy suggest a common pathogenic link between intestinal and extraintestinal disease activity. However, not all EIMs parallel intestinal disease. Skin lesions are usually classified based on their pathophysiological association with the underlying intestinal disease into four categories: (1) specific, (2) reactive, (3) associated, and (4) treatment-induced manifestations. Cutaneous manifestations include erythema nodosum (EN), pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), Sweet's syndrome, and oral lesions, with EN being the most commonly reported and PG showing the most debilitating disease course. Anti-TNF-induced skin reactions are a new, but increasingly recognized phenomenon, which can be eventually misinterpreted as psoriatic lesions. Medical treatment modalities are limited with topical and systemic steroids being the most frequently employed agents. If EIMs parallel intestinal disease activity, the therapeutic cornerstone usually is the management of underlying intestinal disease activity rather than direct treatment of the EIMs. However, increasing evidence for anti-TNF agents' efficacy in EIM management has changed the approach to complicating and debilitating disease courses. In the case of anti-TNF-induced lesions, topical steroids are usually sufficient and discontinuation of anti-TNF is seldom warranted. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on cutaneous EIMs, their diagnostic criteria and clinical presentation, natural history, pathogenesis, and treatment options.",

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Three hundred ninety-five cases of idiopathic MGN with at least 12 mo of follow-up from the Toronto Glomerulonephritis Registry were reviewed to determine the outcome of the subgroup of patients that presented with subnephrotic range proteinuria. Onset and follow-up data included mean arterial pressure (MAP) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Outcome variables included the rate of progression (slope of CrCl), 50% reduction in initial CrCl, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). RESULTS: One hundred eight (27% of the total) patients presented with subnephrotic proteinuria and almost 40% (42 of 108) of this subgroup remained subnephrotic. Their long-term slope was -0.93 ml/min/yr. In contrast, those who subsequently developed nephrotic range proteinuria had a progression rate almost four times faster (-3.52 ml/min/yr). The majority who developed nephrotic syndrome did so within the first year of follow-up. The only distinguishing baseline feature between the two groups was a higher level of urine protein in the group that subsequently developed nephrotic syndrome (1.98 [0.3 to 3.4] versus 2.43 [0.5 to 3.4] g/d). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MGN and sustained subnephrotic range proteinuria have an excellent prognosis. Conservative management with close monitoring is recommended given the difficulty predicting which patients will develop nephrotic range proteinuria and then progress more rapidly.",

METHODS:Patients with FPIES induced by solid foods were identified and their clinical course compared with a control group with FPIES caused by cow's milk and/or soy evaluated over the same time period. RESULTS:Fourteen infants with FPIES caused by grains (rice, oat, and barley), vegetables (sweet potato, squash, string beans, peas), or poultry (chicken and turkey) were identified. Symptoms were typical of classical FPIES with delayed (median: 2 hours) onset of vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy/dehydration. Eleven infants (78%) reacted to >1 food protein, including 7 (50%) that reacted to >1 grain. Nine (64%) of all patients with solid food-FPIES also had cow's milk and/or soy-FPIES. Initial presentation was severe in 79% of the patients, prompting sepsis evaluations (57%) and hospitalization (64%) for dehydration or shock. The diagnosis of FPIES was delayed, after a median of 2 reactions (range: 2-5). Thirty patients with typical cow's milk- and/or soy-FPIES were identified for comparison. Overall, 48% of the 44 infants with FPIES were reactive to >1 food protein, and the risk for multiple food hypersensitivity approached 80% in the infants with solid food or soy-induced FPIES. None of the patients developed FPIES to maternally ingested foods while breastfeeding unless the causal food was fed directly to the infant. CONCLUSIONS:Cereals, vegetables, and poultry meats, typically regarded as of low allergenic potential, must be considered in the evaluation of FPIES, particularly in infants previously diagnosed with FPIES to cow's milk or soy, and as an initial cause in patients who have been exclusively breastfed. Infants with FPIES are at risk for multiple dietary protein hypersensitivities during an apparent period of immunologic susceptibility.

This assessment emphasized the lack of appropriate animal models recapitulating the natural history of this disease. Childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the result of complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and exposure to exogenous agents. The most common chromosomal alteration is the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene, which confers a low risk of developing the malignancy by originating a preleukemic clone requiring secondary hits for full-blown disease to appear. To develop potential prophylactic interventions, we need to identify the environmental triggers of the second hit. Recently, we generated a B-ALL mouse model of the human ETV6-RUNX1+ preleukemic state. Here, we present the results from the ARIMMORA pilot study, obtained by exposing 34 Sca1-ETV6-RUNX1 mice (vs. 27 unexposed) to a 50 Hz magnetic field of 1.5 mT with both fundamental and harmonic content, with an on/off cycle of 10 min/5 min, for 20 h/day, from conception until 3 months of age. Mice were monitored until 2 years of age and peripheral blood was periodically analyzed by flow cytometry. One of the exposed mice developed B-ALL while none of the non-exposed did. Although the results are statistically non-significant due to the limited number of mice used in this pilot experiment, overall, the results show that the newly developed Sca1-ETV6-RUNX1 mouse can be successfully used for ELF-MF exposure studies about the etiology of childhood B-ALL.

RECENT FINDINGS:CMML is a heterogeneous malignant myeloid disorder sharing features of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms and characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis and increased risk of progression to acute leukemia. Its natural course is highly variable and use of CMML-specific prognostic scoring systems is strongly recommended for tailoring treatment. Multiple recent studies have showed that somatic mutations, which are almost always present have a relevant and independent impact on survival but lack a clear role in predicting the response to currently available drugs. SUMMARY:The incorporation of somatic mutations to prognostic scoring systems has improved the prediction of patients' outcomes. Current treatment for CMML remains unsatisfactory. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is the only curative option but is applicable to a minority of patients. Usually higher-risk patients displaying MDS-like characteristics are treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), whereas those with myeloproliferative features generally receive hydroxyurea or HMAs but none of these drugs substantially modify the natural history of CMML. Newer therapies are clearly needed.",

We describe a series of 79 patients (53 families) diagnosed since 2011, made up of all patients in France and Belgium, with a follow up of 2249 patients/years. Median age at first clinical symptoms was 18.6 years (range, 0-61 years). Severe infectious diseases (mycobacteria, fungus, and human papilloma virus) and hematologic malignancies were the most common first manifestations. The probability of remaining symptom-free was 8% at 40 years old. Among the 53 probands, 24 had missense mutations including 4 recurrent alleles, 21 had nonsense or frameshift mutations, 4 had a whole-gene deletion, 2 had splice defects, and 2 patients had complex mutations. There were significantly more cases of leukemia in patients with missense mutations (n=14 of 34) than in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations (n=2 of 28). We also identify new features of the disease: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy related to the JC virus, and immune/inflammatory diseases. A revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score allowed a distinction to be made between a stable disease and hematologic transformation. Chemotherapy is of limited efficacy, and has a high toxicity with severe infectious complications. As the mortality rate is high in our cohort (up to 35% at the age of 40), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the best choice of treatment to avoid severe infectious and/or hematologic complications. The timing of HSCT remains difficult to determine, but the earlier it is performed, the better the outcome.",

In some patients with a history of CMML, the disease transforms to acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML). There are no specific treatment options for patients suffering from CMML except for supportive care and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in patients with advanced disease. New treatment strategies are urgently required, so we have investigated the use of immunotherapeutic directed cytolytic fusion proteins (CFPs), which are chimeric proteins comprising a selective domain and a toxic component (preferably of human origin to avoid immunogenicity). The human serine protease granzyme B is a prominent candidate for tumor immunotherapy because it is expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Here, we report the use of CD64 as a novel target for specific CMML and AMML therapy, and correlate CD64 expression with typical surface markers representing these diseases. We demonstrate that CD64-specific human CFPs kill CMML and AMML cells ex vivo, and that the mutant granzyme B protein R201K is more cytotoxic than the wild-type enzyme in the presence of the granzyme B inhibitor PI9. Besides, the human CFP based on the granzyme B mutant was also able to kill AMML or CMML probes resistant to Pseudomonas exotoxin A.",

For decades, the mainstay of treatment for MDS was supportive care, including transfusion of blood products and growth factors. Further understanding of disease biology led to the discovery of a high prevalence of hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in high-risk MDS and secondary leukemias. Hence, the role of irreversible DNA methlytransferase inhibitors such as azacitidine was investigated with promising outcomes in the treatment of MDS. Azacitidine was initially approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for the treatment of all subtypes of MDS and was granted expanded approval in 2009 to reflect new overall survival data demonstrated in the AZA-001 study of patients with higher-risk MDS. Azacitidine has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful prolongation of survival in higher-risk patients with MDS and has changed the natural history of these disorders. The agent maintains a relatively safe toxicity profile, even in older patients. The role of azacitidine has been explored in the treatment of AML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and has also been studied in the peritransplant setting. Azacitidine has been combined with other novel agents such as lenalidomide, histone deacetylase inhibitors and growth factors in the hope of achieving improved outcomes.

To better understand how patients who have MDS, ICUS, or AML are managed in the routine clinical setting, the Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry, a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients newly diagnosed with these conditions has been initiated.The Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry will capture diagnosis, risk assessment, treatment, and outcomes data for approximately 1500 newly diagnosed patients from approximately 150 community and academic sites in the United States in 4 cohorts: (1) lower-risk MDS (International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS] low and intermediate-1 risk), with and without del(5q); (2) higher-risk MDS (IPSS intermediate-2 and high risk); (3) ICUS; and (4) AML in patients aged ≥ 55 years (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia). Diagnosis will be confirmed by central review. Baseline patient characteristics, diagnostic patterns, treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, health economics outcomes, and patient-reported health-related quality of life will be entered into an electronic data capture system at enrollment and quarterly for 8 years. A tissue substudy to explore the relationship between karyotypes, molecular markers, and clinical outcomes will be conducted, and is optional for patients.The Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry will be the first prospective, observational, non-interventional study in the United States to collect clinical information, patient-reported outcomes, and tissue samples from patients with MDS, ICUS, or AML receiving multiple therapies. Results from this registry may provide new insights into the relationship between diagnostic practices, treatment regimens, and outcomes in patients with these diseases and identify areas for future investigation.Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry ( NCT01688011 ).

Participants completed the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, CARES Medical Interaction Subscale, and other psychosocial measures. A multivariate regression analysis was used to assess independent predictors of post-traumatic stress symptoms.Of the 205 participants, 58% were male, mean age was 50.1 ± 15.4 years, 86% were recently diagnosed, and 94% were receiving active treatment.

Epidemiological data is of key importance for the understanding of the natural history of the disorders as well as to define more effective public health strategies. In order to estimate FAOD birth prevalence in Iberia, the authors collected data from six NBS programs from Portugal and Spain, encompassing the screening of more than 1.6 million newborns by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and compared it with available data from other populations. The participating NBS programs are responsible for the screening of about 46% of all Iberian newborns. Data reveals that Iberia has one of the highest FAOD prevalence in Europe (1:7,914) and that Portugal has the highest birth prevalence of FAOD reported so far (1:6,351), strongly influenced by the high prevalence of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD; 1:8,380), one of the highest ever reported. This is justified by the fact that more than 90% of Portuguese MCADD patients are of Gypsy origin, a community characterized by a high degree of consanguinity. From the comparative analysis of various populations with comparable data other differences emerge, which points to the existence of significant variations in FAOD prevalences among different populations, but without any clear European variation pattern. Considering that FAOD are one of the justifications for MS/MS NBS, the now estimated birth prevalences stress the need to screen all Iberian newborns for this group of inherited metabolic disorders.",

OBJECTIVE:To derive and validate a model predicting curve progression to ≥45° before skeletal maturity in untreated patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:Studies have linked the natural history of AIS with characteristics such as sex, skeletal maturity, curve magnitude, and pattern. The Simplified Skeletal Maturity Scoring System may be of particular prognostic utility for the study of curve progression. The reliability of the system has been addressed; however, its value as a prognostic marker for the outcomes of AIS has not. The BrAIST trial followed a sample of untreated AIS patients from enrollment to skeletal maturity, providing a rare source of prospective data for prognostic modeling. METHODS:The development sample included 115 untreated BrAIST participants. Logistic regression was used to predict curve progression to ≥45° (or surgery) before skeletal maturity. Predictors included the Cobb angle, age, sex, curve type, triradiate cartilage, and skeletal maturity stage (SMS). Internal and external validity was evaluated using jackknifed samples of the BrAIST data set and an independent cohort (n = 152). Indices of discrimination and calibration were estimated. A risk classification was created and the accuracy evaluated via the positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV). RESULTS:The final model included the SMS, Cobb angle, and curve type. The model demonstrated strong discrimination (c-statistics 0.89-0.91) and calibration in all data sets. The classification system resulted in PPVs of 0.71-0.72 and NPVs of 0.85-0.93. CONCLUSIONS:This study provides the first rigorously validated model predicting a short-term outcome of untreated AIS. The resultant estimates can serve two important functions: 1) setting benchmarks for comparative effectiveness studies and 2) most importantly, providing clinicians and families with individual risk estimates to guide treatment decisions.

Increasing Spinal Deformity After Sanders Stage 7 in Females With AIS.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31181026,"BACKGROUND:Accurate prognosis and treatment decisions in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) demand a reliable radiographic marker of growth cessation. Specifically, Sanders Stage 7 (SS7) is a useful marker of spine growth cessation in females and is proposed as a bracing endpoint. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of curve progression noted in female individuals with AIS after achieving SS7. We hypothesize that a subset of patients continues to progress at a greater rate than the natural history at SS7. METHODS:This retrospective review included female patients with AIS treated at a single institution from May 2008 to 2018. Patients required a hand radiograph demonstrating SS7 and concurrent spine radiograph measuring <50 degrees, plus 2-year follow-up spine radiograph. Curve types were categorized by the modified Lenke Classification. Risser grade, menarche, height, weight, and bracing data were collected. Progression was defined as an increase of the main curve ≥5 degrees. Comparison between groups was analyzed using independent t tests and χ or Fisher exact tests as appropriate. Binary logistic regressions were used to construct a model predictive of progressing beyond 50 degrees or undergoing surgery. RESULTS:A total of 89 patients met inclusion criteria, average main curve magnitude 33 degrees (SD 9) at SS7 and 38 degrees (SD 11) at 2-year follow-up. Forty-five (51%) patients progressed ≥5 degrees and 17 (19%) progressed at least 10 degrees. Seventy patients had curves <40 degrees at SS7 and 22 (31%) progressed to >40 degrees at 2 years. Eleven (12%) patients progressed to >50 degrees or had surgery at 2-year follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a threshold of 39.5 degrees curvature at SS7 associated with progression to >50 degrees or surgery (area under the curve=0.94, P<0.001, sensitivity=100%, specificity=87%). Patients with initial curves >40 degrees did have additional height gained (2.1 cm; SD 1.5), but this was not different than those <40 degrees, P>0.05. In addition, no other variables had statistically significant association with those that progressed (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS:A curve >40 degrees at SS7 is at high risk for progressing to a curve measuring >50 degrees or requiring surgery. Those with curves below this threshold still have potential to make clinically significant progression after skeletal maturity. Follow-up of patients beyond SS7 is essential for curves measuring >40 degrees. Reaching SS7 with a curve <50 degrees may not be the endpoint for curve progression, even if predictive of the end of spinal growth. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:Level III-retrospective research study.",

Outcomes assessed in this group of patients included; mortality, pulmonary function, pregnancy-(effect of pregnancy on scoliosis and the effect of scoliosis on pregnancy), radiographic, curve progression, and osteoarthritis. In addition, validated questionnaires were used to evaluate back pain, pulmonary symptoms, general function, depression, and body image. RESULTS:Patients with untreated AIS can function well as adults, become employed, get married, have children, and grow to become active older adults. Unfortunately, untreated scoliosis may lead to increased back pain and pulmonary symptoms for patients with large thoracic curves. Patients with untreated AIS can also develop substantial deformity, and the cosmetic aspect of this condition cannot be disregarded.

This was a cohort of all adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients with curves at high risk to progress based on curve magnitude, premenarchal status in all females, failure of brace treatment, and skeletal immaturity. METHODS:This is a single surgeon retrospective review of consecutive AIS patients treated with Nitinol staples for progressive scoliosis. Fourteen patients, 16 curves from 2005 to 2008 were eligible. Minimum curve for stapling was 30 degrees. Standard preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected. All patients were followed for a minimum of 36 months and to skeletal maturity. Three groups were: improved (group 1), correction of any amount; minimal progression (group 2), progression ≤10 degrees; and failure (group 3), ≥10 degrees of progression. RESULTS:A total of 13 thoracic curves and 2 compensatory lumbar curves met the inclusion criteria (94%). Average follow-up was 61 months. The mean preoperative main thoracic curve was 35 degrees. All but 1 patients progressed at least 9 degrees in a brace prior to stapling. Females were all premenarchal, 10 patients were Risser 0 and 3 Risser 1. The average number of vertebrae stapled per curve was 6. Group 1 included 6 curves (40%). Group 2, 5 curves (33%). Group 3, 4 curves (27%). Three patients went on to uncomplicated fusion. Final curve measurement at the end of follow-up or before fusion (P=0.0037), curve progression (P≤0.001), and percentage of coronal correction on first postoperative standing radiograph (P=0.042) were the significant differences between groups 1+2 (successful) versus group 3 (failures). In total, 73% of this group either progressed ≤10 degrees or improved. CONCLUSIONS:This is the first study that follows AIS patients treated with spine stapling to skeletal maturity. Staples likely changed natural history in some of our patients. Initial percentage of correction on first standing postoperative PA x-rays was the only predictor of success.

Methods:Operated patients with AIS who completed preoperative and postoperative SRS-22 questionnaires were selected for evaluation. The demographic data were collected and quality of life improvement was assessed by comparing deviation to the means with standard deviation at both moments. Using the Minimal Important Clinical Difference (MICD) concept, individual improvement was also assessed. Results:28 patients (27 females) with an average age of 14.4 years (min: 12 - max: 18) and an average Cobb angle of 61.46º (min: 35º- max: 98º) were retrospectively reviewed. The correction rate was 68% with a final Cobb angle of 18.97º (min: 7.37º - max: 37.6º). The Global SRS22 score and all sub domains showed a significant variation (p<0,01). Self-image, followed by mental health, were the subdomains where the mean differences was more relevant, with the highest effect dimension given by d-Cohen analyses (Self-image d-Cohen 2.51; Mental health -d-Cohen 0.86). Both mean score differences as well as global SRS22 score reached the MICD but, while 96.4% of the patients did so for self-image ,the same only happened in 50% of the patients in Mental health and global score. No clinical relevant change occurred in pain or activity domains. Conclusion:Taking into consideration the AIS natural history and the fact that the most relevant change after surgery occurs in patients' self-esteem, the advantages of a surgical treatment should be thoroughly evaluated not only based on curve severity but also by looking at which quality of life subdomains are mostly affected and which are expected to improve in order to meet proper patient expectations.Level of evidence: III.",

Imaging had shown an unremarkable focal adrenal lesion with normal contralateral adrenal morphology, and histology of the resected specimen showed no adverse features. Post-operatively, his blood pressure and serum aldosterone levels fell to the normal range, but 9 months later, his hypertension recurred, primary aldosteronism was again confirmed and he was referred to our centre. Repeat imaging demonstrated an irregular left-sided adrenal lesion with normal contralateral gland appearances. Adrenal venous sampling was performed, which supported unilateral (left-sided) aldosterone hypersecretion. Redo surgery via a laparoscopically assisted transperitoneal approach was performed and multiple nodules were noted extending into the retroperitoneum. It was thought unlikely that complete resection had been achieved. His blood pressure returned to normal post-operatively, although hypokalaemia persisted. Histological examination, from this second operation, showed features of an adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC; including increased mitoses and invasion of fat) that was assessed as malignant using the scoring systems of Weiss and Aubert.

This treatment approach can target tumor cells indirectly since it can affect the endothelium of the growing tumor vasculature and stimulates the anticancer immune response. Both the antiangiogenetic and the immunomodulatory roles of metronomic chemotherapy favor a tumor dormancy, a condition that may improve the patient outcome. Prospective clinical trials conducted in several malignancies have shown that metronomic chemotherapy can obtain disease stabilization or responses in tumors that had been made resistant in vivo to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens. Three prospective phase II trials have been conducted in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). In all of them, patients heavily pretreated with conventional chemotherapy and mitotane have been enrolled. One trial tested the activity of the association of gemcitabine and fluoropyrimidines administered on a metronomic schedule. In this trial, 40% of patients attained a disease stabilization or disease response that was long lasting in some of them. In the remaining two trials, metronomic chemotherapy was administered in association with antiangiogenetic drugs, and the results were disappointing since no response or stable disease was obtained. In conclusion, metronomic chemotherapy can delay tumor progression in advanced ACC and deserves to be further tested. The concomitant administration of antiangiogenetic drugs may be detrimental. Several important questions remain to be addressed such as the optimal dose and most effective dosing interval, when to use the metronomic approach in the natural history of the disease, the choice of cytotoxic drugs, and the most efficacious way to integrate metronomic chemotherapy with standard therapy protocols.",

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to characterize cognitive functioning of ALD men with no or minimal MRI abnormalities, which will define cognitive functioning in this category of patients. METHODS:A neuropsychological battery covering a broad range of cognitive domains, including language, verbal and non-verbal memory, visuoconstruction, executive functioning, and psychomotor speed, was used. Means and proportions of borderline and impaired T scores ≤36 were compared to the standardized norm group and a qualitative case-by-case analysis was performed for participants with T scores ≤36 within ≥2 domains. Patients with MRI abnormalities that were extensive (Loes score > 3) or showed enhancement post-contrast were excluded. RESULTS:Thirty-three men participated (median age 44 years, range 19-71). Mean performance on verbal fluency was poorer in patients (45.70 ± 8.85 patients vs. 50 ± 10 standardized norm group, p = 0.009), as was the percentage of borderline and impaired scores on visuoconstruction (Beery VMI: 19% patients vs. 8% standardized norm group, p = 0.02; RCFT copy: 81% patients vs. 2% standardized norm group, p < 0.0005) and mental reaction time during a complex decision task (18% patients vs. 8% standardized norm group, p = 0.055). Moreover, 9/33 (27.3%) patients had T scores ≤36 within ≥2 domains. CONCLUSIONS:Given the heterogeneous pattern of mostly borderline scores cognitive functioning seems not impaired in the vast majority of adult ALD males with no or minimal MRI abnormalities. However, borderline to impaired cognitive dysfunction was present in 27.3%, with the majority being borderline scores.

Whereas the disease is well characterized in men, the condition remains to be fully clarified in women carrying ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) variants. Specifically, data on clinical progression are needed, in order to recommend any appropriate management. The objective of this study was to outline the natural history of a cohort of untreated ABCD1 heterozygous female carriers. METHODS:Longitudinal data from a single-center population of 60 carriers were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics, anthropometrics, serum very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels, clinical parameters and the Adult ALD Clinical Score (AACS) were collected from every recorded visit in a 7-year period and analyzed to define the phenotype modifications, to determine factors associated with clinical features, and to estimate the annual progression rate and the subsequent sample size for interventional trials. RESULTS:Thirty-two patients were eligible for the study, and 59.4% were symptomatic at baseline. Clinical severity worsens with age which increases risk of symptom onset, the cut-off of 41 years being crucial for phenoconversion. VLCFA levels were not predictive and did not change over time. Symptomatic carriers were followed up for 3.45 ± 2.1 years. The AACS increased at an annual rate of 0.24 points.

We conducted a large multicenter retrospective chart review to characterize the natural history of CALD, to describe outcomes after HSCT, and to identify predictors of treatment outcomes. Major functional disabilities (MFDs) were identified as having the most significant impact on patients' abilities to function independently and were used to assess HSCT outcome. Neurologic function score (NFS) and Loes magnetic resonance imaging score were assessed. Data were collected on 72 patients with CALD who did not undergo HSCT (untreated cohort) and on 65 patients who underwent transplantation (HSCT cohort) at 5 clinical sites. Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates of 5-year overall survival (OS) from the time of CALD diagnosis were 55% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42.2% to 65.7%) for the untreated cohort and 78% (95% CI, 64% to 86.6%) for the HSCT cohort overall (P = .01).

Adverse events post-HSCT included infection (29%; 19 of 65), acute grade II-IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (31%; 18 of 58), and chronic GVHD (7%; 4 of 58). Eighteen percent of the patients (12 of 65) experienced engraftment failure after their first HSCT. Positive predictors of OS in the HSCT cohort may include donor-recipient HLA matching and lack of GVHD, and early disease treatment was predictive of MFD-free survival. GdE+ status is a strong predictor of disease progression in untreated patients.‎ This study confirms HSCT as an effective treatment for CALD when performed early.

Typical histological findings associated with IPH have been described in patients without portal hypertension, probably representing early stages of the disease. Although the pathophysiology of this entity remains largely unknown, it is frequently associated with underlying immunological disorders, bacterial infections, trace metal poisoning, medications, liver circulatory disturbances, and thrombotic events.

We analyzed data for 254 patients who visited our outpatient clinic between 1995 and 2009. All patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers. Immunosuppressive therapy was recommended in cases of deteriorating renal function or untreatable nephrotic syndrome. Primary outcomes for the present study were renal replacement therapy and death. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during follow-up and remission of proteinuria. In total, 124 patients (49%) received immunosuppressive therapy, which predominantly consisted of cyclophosphamide combined with steroids. Ten-year cumulative incidence rates were 3% for renal replacement therapy and 10% for death.

These different diseases represent direct consequences of the ability of parvovirus B19 to target the erythroid cell lineage. However, accumulating evidence suggests that this virus can also infect other cell types resulting in diverse clinical manifestations, of which the pathogenesis remains to be fully elucidated. This has prompted important questions regarding the tropism of the virus and its possible involvement in a broad range of infectious and autoimmune medical conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present an unusual case of persistent parvovirus B19 infection as a cause of chronic hepatitis. This patient had persistent parvovirus B19 viraemia over a period of more than four years and displayed signs of chronic hepatitis evidenced by fluctuating elevated levels of ALAT and a liver biopsy demonstrating chronic hepatitis. Other known causes of hepatitis and liver damage were excluded. In addition, the patient was evaluated for immunodeficiency, since she had lymphopenia both prior to and following clearance of parvovirus B19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: In this case report, we describe the current knowledge on the natural history and pathogenesis of parvovirus B19 infection, and discuss the existing evidence of parvovirus B19 as a cause of acute and chronic hepatitis. We suggest that parvovirus B19 was the direct cause of this patient's chronic hepatitis, and that she had an idiopathic lymphopenia, which may have predisposed her to persistent infection, rather than bone marrow depression secondary to infection. In addition, we propose that her liver involvement may have represented a viral reservoir. Finally, we suggest that clinicians should be aware of parvovirus B19 as an unusual aetiology of chronic hepatitis, when other causes have been ruled out.",

This study assessed the health outcomes of SMA1 infants treated with AVXS-101 gene replacement therapy. METHODS:Twelve genetically confirmed SMA1 infants with homozygous deletions of the SMN1 gene and two SMN2 gene copies received a one-time intravenous proposed therapeutic dose of AVXS-101 in an open label study conducted between December 2014 and 2017. Patients were followed for 2-years post-treatment for outcomes including (1) pulmonary interventions; (2) nutritional interventions; (3) swallow function; (4) hospitalization rates; and (5) motor function. RESULTS:All 12 patients completed the study. Seven infants did not require noninvasive ventilation (NIV) by study completion. Eleven patients had stable or improved swallow function, demonstrated by the ability to feed orally; 11 patients were able to speak. The mean proportion of time hospitalized was 4.4%; the mean unadjusted annualized hospitalization rate was 2.1 (range = 0, 7.6), with a mean length of stay/hospitalization of 6.7 (range = 3, 12.1) days. Eleven patients achieved full head control and sitting unassisted and two patients were walking independently. CONCLUSIONS:AVXS-101 treatment in SMA1 was associated with reduced pulmonary and nutritional support requirements, improved motor function, and decreased hospitalization rate over the follow-up period. This contrasts with the natural history of progressive respiratory failure and reduced survival. The reduced healthcare utilization could potentially alleviate patient and caregiver burden, suggesting an overall improved quality of life following gene replacement therapy.

We set out to evaluate retrospectively neuroradiologic data from a large sample of patients with AGS, focusing on the pattern of white matter abnormalities and the temporal evolution of the cerebral involvement to establish the radiologic natural history of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Thirty-six patients, 18 girls and 18 boys, were included. All had a clinical diagnosis of AGS, genetically confirmed in 31 of them. For every subject, we reviewed at least 1 CT and 1 MR imaging study; 19 (52.7%) had multiple examinations. In all, we reviewed 109 examinations. Clinical-neuroradiologic comparisons were analyzed by using the chi(2) test. RESULTS:Calcifications were found in all subjects, mainly in the basal ganglia, lobar white matter, and dentate nuclei. Abnormal white matter was present in all the subjects, showing 2 patterns of distribution: diffuse in 18 (50%) and an anteroposterior gradient in 18 (50%). Cystic areas were observed in the temporal and/or frontal lobes in 12/36 patients (33.3%). A correlation was found between early age at onset and severity of the leukoencephalopathy in the frontal (P = .024) and temporal (P = .034) regions. A significant degree of cerebral atrophy was found in 31/36 subjects (86.1%). The neuroradiologic presentation remained substantially stable with time.

The main extraneurological symptoms are chilblain-like skin lesions, usually on the fingers, toes and ears. SOURCES OF DATA: This review is based on a search of the published literature on AGS from 1984 onwards (particularly the most recent papers) and on knowledge and experience gained through the authors' work with the International Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome Association (IAGSA). AREAS OF AGREEMENT: It is accepted that AGS can be mistaken for a congenital infection and that the diagnostic significance of its cardinal signs (raised INF-alpha levels, basal ganglia calcifications) is different in different stages of the disease. Currently, we know of four genes that, if mutated, can give rise to AGS, but at least one other gene is believed to exist. These genes are involved in the DNA damage response, a defect of which could provoke an inappropriate innate immune response, triggering increased secretion of INF-alpha, ultimately responsible for the main features of the disease. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The natural history of AGS has not yet been definitively described given the lack of extensive, long-term neuroradiological follow-up studies. Furthermore, it is not yet clearly understood how the innate immune system is activated, what triggers the onset of the disease or why it tends to 'burn out' after several months. Immunosuppressive therapy in the active stage of the disease does not seem to produce any real change in the clinical course, but more data are needed. GROWING POINTS AND AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Current studies aim to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AGS and to establish the exact pathway by which retained nucleic acids activate the immune system. This knowledge could allow the development of therapeutic strategies.",

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions.",

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]",

Enhanced bone resorption is a recurrent histological feature of FD and a major cause of fragility of affected bones. Previous work suggests that increased bone resorption in FD is driven by RANKL and some studies have shown that the anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody, denosumab, reduces bone turnover and bone pain in FD patients. However, the effect of RANKL inhibition on the histopathology of FD and its impact on the natural history of the disease remain to be assessed. In this study, we treated the EF1α-Gs αR201C mice, which develop an FD-like phenotype, with an anti-mouse RANKL monoclonal antibody. We found that the treatment induced marked radiographic and microscopic changes at affected skeletal sites in 2-month-old mice. The involved skeletal segments became sclerotic due to the deposition of new, highly mineralized bone within developing FD lesions and showed a higher mechanical resistance compared to affected segments from untreated transgenic mice. Similar changes were also detected in older mice with a full-blown skeletal phenotype. The administration of anti-mouse RANKL antibody arrested the growth of established lesions and, in young mice, prevented the appearance of new ones. However, after drug withdrawal, the newly formed bone was remodelled into FD tissue and the disease progression resumed in young mice. Taken together, our results show that the anti-RANKL antibody significantly affected the bone pathology and natural history of FD in the mouse. Pending further work on the prevention and management of relapse after treatment discontinuation, our preclinical study suggests that RANKL inhibition may be an effective therapeutic option for FD patients. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

Developmental outcomes (diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD; social and communication disorder, SCD; or Autistic Spectrum Disorder, ASD; Short Sensory Profile, SSP; Vineland II Adaptive Behaviour Scales) were compared across two exposure groups: prenatal alcohol only; and mixed prenatal alcohol and neglect. RESULTS:ADHD (74%) and ASD/SCD (68%) were common, with no significant difference between groups (ADHD, p = 0.924; ASD, p = 0.742). Vineland age equivalence scores were lower than chronological age (11.1 years - prenatal alcohol only, and 12.7 years - neglect) across all domains, especially receptive language (3.7 years for both groups).

We demonstrate a significant functional neurologic correction in treated animals from 4 months onward, a neuromuscular improvement from 9 months onward, and a correction of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at 12 months. The regions most affected by the disease i.e. the brainstem, spinal cord, and the left cardiac ventricular wall all show enzymatic, biochemical and histological correction. Muscle glycogen storage is not affected by the treatment, thus suggesting that the restoration of muscle functionality is directly related to the CNS correction. This unprecedented global and long-term CNS and cardiac cure offer new perspectives for the management of patients.",

The median ages of first symptoms and first medical attention were 20.5(6-44) and 29(9-44) years respectively. The most common initial complaint was decreased exercise tolerance. Two patients' first complaint was difficulty with getting up from lying position and failure to perform sit up. The mean time from first medical attention to diagnosis was 1.3 years but one patient was diagnosed 8 years later. Half of the patients sought medical attention due to progressive shortness of breath and all of them developed type 2 respiratory failure requiring ventilator support during the first admission.

The X-linked nature of inheritance accounts for reported differences in phenotypic severity between men and women. The rarity of Danon disease has limited understanding of the complete phenotype. Clinical estimates of ages of disease onset and survival based on gender have not been published. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present data on 82 patients with Danon disease from 36 families, the largest series to date. Men were severely affected with cognitive disabilities (100%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (88%), and muscle weakness (80%). Men had a high morbidity and were unlikely to reach the age of 25 years without a cardiac transplantation. Women were less severely affected but reported higher than expected levels of cognitive (47%) and skeletal muscle complaints (50%) and manifesting an equal prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Combining our data with that of 63 other Danon disease case reports in the literature, the average ages of first symptom, cardiac transplantation, and death were 12.1, 17.9, and 19.0 years in men and 27.9, 33.7, and 34.6 years in women, respectively. CONCLUSION: These data more broadly illuminate the Danon disease phenotype and should prove useful to physicians working with and providing genetic counseling to families with Danon disease. Women with Danon disease present with clinical symptoms and events approximately 15 years after men and report a higher proportion of cognitive and skeletal muscle problems than previously recognized.",

However, little is known about the treatment of anti-CD36 mediated FNAIT in this region. A Chinese male foetus, whose mother had a history of multiple intrauterine foetal demise and/or hydrops, was diagnosed with severe FNAIT at 27 weeks of gestational age. Immunological analysis revealed total absence of CD36 on platelets and monocytes from mother, caused by a 329-330delAC mutation of the CD36 gene. Anti-CD36 and anti-HLA class I antibodies were detected in the maternal serum, whereas only anti-CD36 isoantibodies were detectable in the foetal blood sample. Serial intrauterine transfusions with red blood cells (RBC) and platelets from a CD36null donor were performed to improve the severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia. The baby (2250 g; Apgar scores 10) was delivered vaginally at 32 weeks of gestation with normal haemoglobin (186 g/L) but low platelet count (48 × 109/L). After 2 days the platelet count rose to 121 × 109/L.

We have initiated an international registry containing information on 69 patients, of which 31 are previously unpublished. In this perspective, we analyze the available clinical information to document the natural history of BHFS. In the future, once we have accrued sufficient cases, we aim to build on this study and provide information to allow counseling of at-risk couples. To date, 39 patients have survived beyond the age of 5 years, 18 of whom are now older than 10 years. Based on the available cases, we find evidence to suggest that intrauterine therapy provides benefits during the perinatal and neonatal period; however, it may not provide additional benefits to long-term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Growth retardation is a major adverse long-term outcome among BHFS patients with ∼40% being severely affected in terms of weight and ∼50% in terms of height. There is also an increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay as we find 20% (11/55) of BHFS survivors suffer from a serious delay of ≥6 months. Most patients in the registry require lifelong transfusion and often have associated congenital abnormalities and comorbidities. This perspective is a first step in gathering information to allow provision of informed counseling on the predicted outcomes of affected babies.",

METHODS: Five families with a suspicion of ATS were investigated both from a clinical and molecular point of view. COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes were analysed by DHPLC. Automated sequencing was performed to identify the underlying mutation. RESULTS: Molecular analysis indicated that in all 5 cases the correct diagnosis was autosomal recessive ATS. In three families in which parental consanguinity clearly pinpointed to autosomal recessive ATS, we found COL4A4 homozygous mutations in two of them and COL4A3 homozygous mutation in the other one.

Considerable evidence points to developmental abnormalities of the basal ganglia as tic substrates. Basal ganglia dysfunction does not account for important features of Tourette syndrome, including its natural history, male predominance, and the characteristic quality and distribution of tics. The latter mainly involve eye, face, and head movements, in addition to a variety of simple to complex phonations. A major normal function of these movements, and of phonations as well, is social signaling. Many important species- and sex-specific stereotyped social behaviors are mediated by a phylogenetically conserved network of subcortical nuclei, the social behavior network (SBN). Some SBN nuclei are sexually dimorphic, and SBN function is modulated strongly by gonadal steroids. Recent studies indicate that the SBN meshes with the basal ganglia to form a larger network, the Social Decision Making Network (SDM; O'Connell and Hofmann [2011]). The SDM concept overlaps significantly with Holstege's (1993) model of an emotional motor system mediating socially relevant facial movements and phonations. Dopaminergic signaling within the basal ganglia component of the SDM may regulate social act motivation with the SBN component responsible for act expression. Developmental SDM abnormalities can explain all major Tourette syndrome features, including natural history, male predominance, the characteristic distribution of tics, and their stereotyped quality. Some data directly support this hypothesis. Tourette syndrome may be a disorder of social communication manifesting primarily as abnormal involuntary movements.",

PROCEDURES:Review of clinical notes, retinal imaging including fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), electroretinography (ERG), and molecular genetic testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Demographic data, symptoms at presentation, visual acuity, evidence of progression, OCT and FAF findings, ERG assessment, and molecular genetics. RESULTS:Twenty-one subjects with GUCY2D-LCA were included, with a mean follow-up ± standard deviation (SD) of 10 ± 11.85 years. Marked reduction in visual acuity (VA) and nystagmus was documented in all patients within the first 3 years of life. Fifty-seven percent (n = 12) exhibited photophobia and 38% (n = 8) had nyctalopia. VA was worse than hand motion in 71% of the patients (n = 15). Longitudinal assessment of VA showed stability in all patients, except 1 patient who experienced deterioration over a follow-up of 44 years. Hyperopia was reported in 13 of the 17 subjects (71%) with available refraction data. Eighteen subjects had either normal fundus appearance (n = 14) or a blond fundus (n = 3), while only 4 of the eldest subjects had mild retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy (mean, 49 years; range 40-54 years). OCT data were available for 11 subjects and 4 different grades of ellipsoid zone (EZ) integrity were identified: (1) continuous/intact EZ (n = 6), (2) focally disrupted EZ (n = 2), (3) focally disrupted with RPE changes (n = 2), and (4) diffuse EZ disruption with RPE changes (n = 1). All examined subjects had stable OCT findings over the long follow-up period. Full-field ERGs showed evidence of a severe cone-rod dystrophy in 5 of 6 patients and undetectable ERGs in 1 subject.

We treated four RPE65-mutant dogs in mid-life (age = 5-6 years) and followed them long-term (4-5 years). At the time of the intervention at mid-life, there were intra-ocular and inter-animal differences in local photoreceptor layer health ranging from near normal to complete degeneration. Treated locations having more than 63% of normal photoreceptors showed robust treatment-related retention of photoreceptors in the long term. Treated regions with less retained photoreceptors at the time of the intervention showed progressive degeneration similar to untreated regions with matched initial stage of disease.

Clinical trials in inherited retinal diseases have unique challenges, and natural history studies are critical to successful trial design. The purpose of this study was to characterise the natural history of RDH12-associated retinal degeneration. METHODS:A retrospective chart review was performed in individuals with retinal degeneration and two likely disease-causing variants in RDH12. RESULTS:57 subjects were enrolled from nine countries. 33 subjects had clinical records available from childhood. The data revealed an EOSRD, with average age of onset of 4.1 years. Macular atrophy was a universal clinical finding in all subjects, as young as 2 years of age. Scotopic and photopic electroretinography (ERG) responses were markedly reduced in all subjects, and a non-recordable ERG was documented as young as 1 year of age. Assessment of visual acuity, visual field and optical coherence tomography revealed severe loss of function and structure in the majority of subjects after the age of 10 years. Widefield imaging in 23 subjects revealed a unique, variegated watercolour-like pattern of atrophy in 13 subjects and sparing of the peripapillary area in 18 subjects. CONCLUSIONS:This study includes the largest collection of phenotypic data from children with RDH12-associated EOSRD and provides a comprehensive description of the timeline of vision loss in this severe, early-onset condition. These findings will help identify patients with RDH12-associated retinal degeneration and will inform future design of therapeutic trials.",

Available single disease registries provide reliable information regarding natural history, efficacy and side effects of treatments, and contribute to the discovery of the causative genes. However, these registries could not shed light on the true incidence of the various syndromes. We, therefore, established an Israeli national registry in order to investigate the relative frequency of each of these syndromes and their complications. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were registered by their hematologists in all 16 medical centers in Israel. We included patients with Fanconi anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, dyskeratosis congenita, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and thrombocytopenia with absent radii. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients diagnosed between 1966 and 2007 were registered. Fifty-two percent were found to have Fanconi anemia, 17% severe congenital neutropenia, 14% Diamond-Blackfan anemia, 6% congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, 5% dyskeratosis congenita, 2% Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and 2% thrombocytopenia with absent radii. No specific diagnosis was made in only 2 patients. Of the thirty patients (24%) developing severe bone marrow failure, 80% had Fanconi anemia. Seven of 9 patients with leukemia had Fanconi anemia, as did all 6 with solid tumors. Thirty-four patients died from their disease; 25 (74%) had Fanconi anemia and 6 (17%) had severe congenital neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive population-based study evaluating the incidence and complications of the different inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. By far the most common disease was Fanconi anemia, followed by severe congenital neutropenia and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Fanconi anemia carried the worst prognosis, with severe bone marrow failure and cancer susceptibility. Diamond-Blackfan anemia had the best prognosis.

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions.",

METHODS:Recruitment to the PW cohort will take place in antenatal care clinics. PW will be enrolled regardless of symptoms and followed over the course of pregnancy, approximately every 4 weeks. PW will be revisited at delivery (or after miscarriage/abortion) to assess birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities according to the evolving definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). After birth, children will be followed for 2 years in the CH cohort. Follow-up visits are scheduled at ages 1-3, 4-6, 12, and 24 months to assess neurocognitive and developmental milestones. In addition, a NH cohort for the characterization of symptomatic rash/fever illness was designed, including follow-up to capture persisting health problems. Blood, urine, and other biological materials will be collected, and tested for ZIKV and other relevant arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever) using RT-PCR or serological methods. A virtual, decentralized biobank will be created. Reciprocal clinical monitoring has been established between partner sites. Substudies of ZIKV seroprevalence, transmission clustering, disabilities and health economics, viral kinetics, the potential role of antibody enhancement, and co-infections will be linked to the cohort studies. DISCUSSION:Results of these large cohort studies will provide better risk estimates for birth defects and other developmental abnormalities associated with ZIKV infection including possible co-factors for the variability of risk estimates between other countries and regions.

The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]",

The present study reports on our experience in the postoperative follow-up of a consecutive series of patients with type A aortic dissection. METHODS: Between January 1986 and December 1996, 89 patients underwent emergency surgery for type A acute aortic dissection; the overall hospital mortality rate was 22% (20/89). This study includes the 69 hospital survivors (49 men and 20 women). Forty-six patients had ascending aortic graft replacement, 13 patients underwent replacement of aortic valve and ascending aorta by a composite graft. The surgical repair was extended to the aortic arch in 5 patients. All patients were serially evaluated by clinical examination and imaging techniques (transthoracic echocardiography in all patients, magnetic resonance imaging in 40, transesophageal echocardiography in 33 and computed tomography in 25). Follow-up was complete in 97% of patients (two patients were lost to follow-up and excluded from the study) and extended to a maximum of 152 months (mean 74 +/- 39 months). The postoperative quality of life was assessed by a questionnaire in 51 current survivors. Risk factors for cardiovascular death, reoperation and poor quality of life were investigated with univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: During the follow-up period 15 patients (22%) died; in 13 cases death was due to cardiovascular causes and in 6 of them it was related to aortic disease. The Kaplan-Meier survival was 92 +/- 3%, 87 +/- 5%, 78 +/- 6% and 70 +/- 8% at 2, 4, 6 and 8 years, respectively. A persistent aortic dissection was demonstrated in 50 patients (75%) and 42 of them showed the presence of flow in the false lumen. A dilatation of one or more aortic segments was found in 59 patients (88%), with a diameter > or = 50 mm in 17 and > or = 60 mm in 8. In 30 patients who underwent transesophageal echocardiography the relation between aortic dimensions and flow pattern in the false lumen was examined; the presence of aneurysmal dilatation with a diameter > or = 50 mm was significantly correlated with a ""high flow"" pattern. Ten patients (15%) underwent reoperation from 13 to 83 months postoperatively. Reoperation was indicated for: sinus of Valsalva aneurysm and severe aortic regurgitation (2 patients), severe aortic regurgitation (2 patients), aneurysm of the arch (1 patient), thoracoabdominal aneurysm (1 patient), periprosthetic pseudoaneurysm (4 patients). The hospital mortality rate was 20% (2 patients). Sixty-two% of current survivors are asymptomatic; 30 patients returned to their predissection status. Quality of live is judged ""good"" by 23 patients, ""fairly good"" by 21 patients and ""poor"" by 7 patients. No significant independent risk factor for cardiovascular death, reoperation and poor quality of life was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term prognosis after surgical treatment of type A aortic dissection is not satisfactory because of a significant risk of late complications. However, the results of our study can be judged fairly good, particularly if we consider the natural history of the disease.",

Prevalence and mean intensity of infection are characterized by heterogeneity across a region, leading to uncertainty in the impact of MDA strategies. In this paper, we analyze this heterogeneity in terms of factors that govern the transmission dynamics of the parasite in the host population. RESULTS:Using data from the TUMIKIA study in Kenya (cluster STH prevalence range at baseline: 0-63%), we estimated these parameters and their variability across 120 population clusters in the study region, using a simple parasite transmission model and Gibbs-sampling Monte Carlo Markov chain techniques. We observed great heterogeneity in R0 values, with estimates ranging from 1.23 to 3.27, while k-values (which vary inversely with the degree of parasite aggregation within the human host population) range from 0.007 to 0.29 in a positive association with increasing prevalence. The main finding of this study is the increasing trend for greater parasite aggregation as prevalence declines to low levels, reflected in the low values of the negative binomial parameter k in clusters with low hookworm prevalence. Localized climatic and socioeconomic factors are investigated as potential drivers of these observed epidemiological patterns. CONCLUSIONS:Our results show that lower prevalence is associated with higher degrees of aggregation and hence prevalence alone is not a good indicator of transmission intensity. As a consequence, approaches to MDA and monitoring and evaluation of community infection status may need to be adapted as transmission elimination is aimed for by targeted treatment approaches.",

Here we exposed laboratory-reared wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) that were derived from wild-caught animals to two naturally-occurring parasites (nematode: Heligmosomoides polygyrus, coccidia: Eimeria hungaryensis) to investigate the impact of coinfection on parasite infection dynamics, and to determine if the host immune response mediates this interaction. Coinfection led to delayed worm expulsion and prolonged egg shedding in H. polygyrus infections and lower peak E. hungaryensis oocyst burdens. By comparing antibody levels between wild and colony-housed mice, we also found that wild mice had elevated H. polygyrus-IgG1 titres even if currently uninfected with H. polygyrus.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to clone and characterise the cDNA encoding this allergen. The Ani s 4 mRNA sequence was obtained using a PCR-based strategy. The Ani s 4 amino acid sequence contained the characteristic domains of cystatins. Mature recombinant Ani s 4 was expressed in a bacterial system as a His-tagged soluble protein. The recombinant Ani s 4 inhibited the cleavage of a peptide substrate by papain with a Ki value of 20.6 nM. Immunobloting, ELISA, a commercial fluorescence-enzyme-immunoassay and a basophil activation test were used to study the allergenic properties of rAni s 4, demonstrating that the recombinant allergen contained the same IgE epitopes as the native Ani s 4, and that it was a biologically active allergen since it activated basophils from patients with allergy to A. simplex in a specific concentration-dependent manner. Ani s 4 was localised by immunohistochemical methods, using a polyclonal anti-Ani s 4 anti-serum, in both the secretory gland and the basal layer of the cuticle of A. simplex L3. In conclusion, we believe that Ani s 4 is the first nematode cystatin that is a human allergen. The resulting rAni s 4 retains all allergenic properties of the natural allergen, and can therefore be used in immunodiagnosis of human anisakiasis.",

Consequently, the placement of titanium implants has changed the paradigms of restorative dentistry. Implants are used to prevent placing reconstructions anchored on natural teeth when these are vital and intact. Furthermore, implants are suitable to improve subjective chewing function and to replace missing and strategically important abutments. The osseointegration process is characterized by a predictable sequence of healing events that encompass the formation of woven bone, parallel fibers, and lamellar bone and result in fully functional bone that will remodel throughout life. While the osseointegration facilitates the use of implants as prosthetic abutments, it has to be kept in mind that the peri-implant soft tissue may be subject to biological complications. This, in turn, may result in an infectious process that will jeopardize the osseointegration. Consequently, the monitoring of the peri-implant tissues is an important aspect, and early intervention in situations with peri-implant mucositis is mandatory for the prevention of peri-implantitis. Hence, it is evident that oral implants need lifelong maintenance care if their longevity is to be assured.",

On the basis of the comparative histology of periodontal tissues, protoacrodontal, acrodontal, acro-protothecodontal, pleurodontal and thecodontal structures can be distinguished that depend upon the area of attachment (crestal, marginal or socketed type) and the mode of attachment (ankylosis, fibrous or combined type). Due to ""phylogenetic memory"", changes of the periodontium in health and disease could be interpreted as copies of phylogenetically older patterns. The greatest variations in tooth attachment have originated in acrodont bony fishes and in pleurodont reptiles, whereas the selection for a single thecodont or socketed type was an important event in the evolution of mammals. The detailed structures of cementum, of the fiber apparatus and of the junctional epithelium vary from type to type and within one type. These principal structures are decisive for reaction patterns of degeneration and regeneration. Therefore, comparative periodontology could be an important adjunct to help interpret the natural history of periodontal diseases, to help in the selection of experimental animals and to help provide treatment strategies in both human and veterinary situations.",

Current knowledge of endoscopic findings of annular pancreas is limited to small case series. The aim of this study was to describe the endoscopic and pancreatographic findings of patients with annular pancreas at a large tertiary care ERCP center. METHODS:This is a retrospective observational study. Our Institutional Review Board-approved, prospectively collected ERCP database was queried for cases of annular pancreas. The electronic medical records were searched for patient and procedure-related data. RESULTS:From January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2016, 46 patients with annular pancreas underwent ERCP at our institution. Index ERCP was technically successful in 42 patients (91.3%), and technical success was achieved in all 46 patients (100%) after 2 attempts, when required. A duodenal narrowing or ring was found in most patients (n = 39, 84.8%), yet only 2 (4.3%) had retained gastric contents. Pancreas divisum was found in 21 patients (45.7%), 18 of which were complete divisum. Pancreatobiliary neoplasia was the indication for ERCP in 7 patients (15.2%). Pancreatographic findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis were noted in 15 patients (32.6%) at the index ERCP. CONCLUSION:This is the largest series describing the endoscopic and pancreatographic findings of patients with annular pancreas. We found that 45.7% of patients had concurrent pancreas divisum. Endoscopic therapy was successful in most patients at our institution after 1 ERCP, and in all patients after a second ERCP. Nearly one-third of patients had findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis at the time of index ERCP. It is unclear whether this may be a feature of the natural history of annular pancreas.",

We aimed to investigate the association of ALBI score with natural history of chronic HBV infection and treatment response of CHB patients. METHODS:The ALBI score in a cohort of 849 individuals including 721 chronic HBV-infected patients naïve to anti-HBV treatment in different phases and 128 healthy controls were estimated. Additionally, the dynamic changes of ALBI score of 243 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients treated with pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-α) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) were tested for 72 weeks. RESULTS:ALBI score differed among phases, with the highest score in HBeAg-positive CHB patients, followed by HBeAg-negative CHB patients, HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection, and HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection. Besides, CHB patients harbouring high baseline ALBI score exhibited a relatively stronger therapeutic response to PEG-IFN-α or NAs. Moreover, the rate of HBeAg and HBsAg loss in patients with ALBI grade 2 was persistently higher than that in patients with ALBI grade 1 throughout the course of treatment. Furthermore, ALBI score was an independent predictor of sustained response achievement. The combined use of ALBI score, HBeAg and ALT could enhance the predictive value of treatment response. CONCLUSIONS:ALBI score differed significantly across the natural course of chronic HBV infection and was correlated with PEG-IFN-α and NAs treatment response in HBeAg-positive CHB patients, which suggested that ALBI score could be useful as an auxiliary clinical factor to determine the initiation of therapy and predict stronger antiviral treatment response.",

In the present study, I propose that heritable intraspecific variation in prey, which facilitates natural selection, is a key to solve this issue. A mathematical model reveals that diverse genotypes in a prey promote the coexistence of multiple predator species. When two predators share a prey with multiple genotypes, evolution nearly selects the two prey genotypes. Through analysis, I establish a condition of coexistence of such multiple predator-one prey interaction with two genotypes. If each prey type has high defensive capacity against different predator species, stable coexistence is likely to occur. Particularly, interspecific variations of life-history parameters allow the coexistence equilibrium to be stable. In addition, rapid evolution in a prey allows more than two predator species to coexist. Furthermore, mutation tends to stabilize otherwise unstable systems. These results suggest that intraspecific variation in a prey plays a key role in the maintenance of diverse predator species by driving adaptive evolution.",

Species-area relationship (SAR) models traditionally have been used for estimating species richness, species loss as a function of habitat loss, and extrapolation of richness for given areas. Sampling-species relationships (SSRs) are interrelated yet separate drivers for species richness estimates. Traditionally, however, SAR and SSR models have been used independently and not incorporated into a single approach. We developed and compared predictive models that incorporate sampling effort species-area relationships (SESARS) along the entire Atlantic Forest of South America, and then applied the best-fit model to estimate richness in forest remnants of Interior Atlantic Forest of eastern Paraguay. This framework was applied to non-volant small mammal assemblages that reflect different tolerances to forest loss and fragmentation. In order to account for differences in functionality we estimated small mammal richness of 1) the entire non-volant small mammal assemblage, including introduced species; 2) the native species forest assemblage; and 3) the forest-specialist assemblage, with the latter two assemblages being subsets of the entire assemblage. Finally, we geospatially modeled species richness for each of the three assemblages throughout eastern Paraguay to identify remnants with high species richness. We found that multiple regression power-law interaction-term models that only included area and the interactions of area and sampling as predictors, worked best for predicting species richness for the entire assemblage and the native species forest assemblage, while several traditional SAR models (logistic, power, exponential, and ratio) best described forest-specialist richness. Species richness was significantly different between assemblages. We identified obvious remnants with high species richness in eastern Paraguay, and these remnants often were geographically isolated. We also found relatively high predicted species richness (in relation to the entire range of predicted richness values) in several geographically-isolated, medium-size forest remnants that likely have not been considered as possible priority areas for conservation. These findings highlight the importance of using an empirical dataset, created using sources representing diverse sampling efforts, to develop robust predictive models. This approach is particularly important in geographic locations where field sampling is limited yet the geographic area is experiencing rapid and dramatic land cover changes. When combined, area and sampling are powerful modeling predictors for questions of biogeography, ecology, and conservation, especially when addressing habitat loss and fragmentation.",

However, their use is subject to a number of challenges, principally the identification of taxa within the images without associated physical specimens. The challenge of applying traditional taxonomic keys to the identification of fauna from images has led to the development of personal, group, or institution level reference image catalogues of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or morphospecies. Lack of standardisation among these reference catalogues has led to problems with observer bias and the inability to combine datasets across studies. In addition, lack of a common reference standard is stifling efforts in the application of artificial intelligence to taxon identification. Using the North Atlantic deep sea as a case study, we propose a database structure to facilitate standardisation of morphospecies image catalogues between research groups and support future use in multiple front-end applications. We also propose a framework for coordination of international efforts to develop reference guides for the identification of marine species from images. The proposed structure maps to the Darwin Core standard to allow integration with existing databases. We suggest a management framework where high-level taxonomic groups are curated by a regional team, consisting of both end users and taxonomic experts. We identify a mechanism by which overall quality of data within a common reference guide could be raised over the next decade.

Congenital AT deficiency is an infrequently encountered genetic risk factor for VTE, and different subtypes vary with regard to their thrombotic risk. Patients with congenital AT deficiency, especially those with quantitative deficiency (type 1), may develop thrombosis early in life and often have a conspicuous family history of first- and second-degree relatives with VTE.

The absolute risk of VTE is low, and the utility of laboratory investigation for inherited thrombophilia in patients with VTE and their asymptomatic relatives has been largely debated, leading to the production of several Guidelines from Scientific Societies and Working Groups. The risk for VTE largely depends on the family history of VTE. Therefore, indiscriminate search for carriers is of no utility, and targeted screening is potentially more fruitful. In patients with VTE inherited thrombophilia is not scored as a determinant of recurrence, playing a minor role in the decision of prolonging anticoagulation; indeed, a few guidelines consider testing worthwhile to identify carriers of high-risk thrombophilia, particularly those with a family history of VTE. The identification of the asymptomatic carrier relatives of the probands with VTE and thrombophilia could reduce cases of provoked VTE, offering them primary antithrombotic prophylaxis during risk situations. In most guidelines, this is considered justified only for relatives of probands with a deficiency of natural anticoagulants or multiple abnormalities. Counselling the asymptomatic female relatives of individuals with VTE and/or thrombophilia before pregnancy or the prescription of hormonal treatments should be administered with consideration of the risk driven by the type of thrombophilia and the family history of VTE.",

It usually appears as an isolated congenital anomaly, but may also be associated with other malformations, the most common being coronary artery anomalies. Current technology enables noninvasive diagnosis in most cases. This entity's natural history is progression to valve regurgitation, which is rare before adulthood. OBJECTIVE: Case review of quadricuspid aortic valve patients diagnosed in the last 10 years in a tertiary pediatric cardiology center. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with quadricuspid aortic valve between January 2000 and December 2009. RESULTS: Over the past 10 years, four cases of quadricuspid aortic valve were diagnosed in children aged between 6 months and 8 years, two male. In three cases, the four leaflets were of similar size, which is the most common finding. Two of the valves functioned normally and two had minimal regurgitation. All patients had associated cardiac malformations (one atrial and two ventricular septal defects, one supravalvular aortic stenosis and one quadricuspid pulmonary valve). One patient was also diagnosed with Williams syndrome. During a median follow-up of 2 years (0-9), all patients remained asymptomatic and none required medical or surgical treatment of the aortic valve. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of quadricuspid aortic valve is rare, especially in children, since most patients are asymptomatic and have normally functioning valves. In this study, half the patients had minimal aortic regurgitation. Contrary to what is described in the literature, all patients had concomitant cardiac malformations. We provide the first description of this entity's association with Williams syndrome. Clinical follow-up should be maintained in these patients in order to promptly detect the onset or worsening of functional alterations and to enable appropriate therapeutic intervention.",

The natural history of the Doppler-estimated maximum gradient (DEMG) in patients after balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAVP) has not previously been studied on a large scale. METHODS AND RESULTS:A retrospective review was performed of 360 patients from 1984 to 2012 with aortic stenosis, providing a total of 2059 echocardiograms both before and after BAVP. Patients were excluded if they had an intervention within the first 30 days of life. The relationships between the aortic stenosis DEMG and several predictors (age at initial study, body surface area, valve morphology, and initial DEMG) were explored using linear mixed effect models. Patients with a unicommissural aortic valve had a significantly higher rate of progression compared with those with a bicommissural aortic valve (0.81 and 0.45 mm Hg/year; P<0.001). The median rate of progression in the post-BAVP group was significantly lower than the median pre-BAVP rate of progression (n=34; pre-BAVP 3.97 [1.69-8.7] mm Hg/year; post-BAVP 0.40 [-1.80 to 3.88] mm Hg/year; P<0.008). When adjusted for body surface area, there was no significant increase in the DEMG (-0.03 mm Hg/m2 per year; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:There is a statistically significant increase in the DEMG over time in patients with aortic stenosis. After balloon dilation, the DEMG rate of change is reduced compared with that pre-dilation. Given the effect of body surface area on DEMG progression, more frequent observation should be made during periods of rapid somatic growth.",

To describe the detailed and comprehensive natural history of children with T13 receiving intensive neonatal and pediatric treatment without cardiac surgery, we reviewed clinical information of 24 children with full T13 (15 boys, 9 girls) who were admitted to Nagano Children's Hospital from 1994 to 2016. Intensive neonatal and pediatric treatment without cardiac surgery was provided through careful discussion with the parents. We detailed accurate frequencies of complications, survival, underlying factors and the final modes of death, and psychomotor development of survivors.

In 1963, Herbert Sloan at the University of Michigan completed the first repair using a nonvalved conduit with long-term survival (not reported until 1974). At the Mayo Clinic, Rastelli and McGoon studied and completed the first repair with a valved homograft in 1967. In 1976, Ebert used the 12-mm Hancock valved conduit in infants under six months of age (University of California, San Francisco). In Boston (mid-1980s), Jonas and Castañeda used aortic homografts, which greatly reduced bleeding as a postoperative complication. In the early 1990s, Bove (University of Michigan) reported outstanding results with an approach based on primary repair within the first few days of life for patients with truncus arteriosus.

These conditions have been only partially investigated so that a systematic comparison of their characteristics remains incomplete. We aim to compare genetic profiles and clinical outcomes in FCS and MCS. Approach and Results: Thirty-two patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride >1000 mg/dL despite lipid-lowering treatments with or without history of acute pancreatitis) were enrolled. Rare and common variants were screened using a panel of 18 triglyceride-raising genes, including the canonical LPL, APOC2, APOA5, GP1HBP1, and LMF1. Clinical information was collected retrospectively for a median period of 44 months. Across the study population, 37.5% were classified as FCS due to the presence of biallelic, rare mutations and 59.4% as MCS due to homozygosity for nonpathogenic or heterozygosity for pathogenic variants in canonical genes, as well as for rare and low frequency variants in noncanonical genes. As compared with MCS, FCS patients showed a lower age of hypertriglyceridemia onset, higher levels of on-treatment triglycerides, and 3-fold higher incidence rate of acute pancreatitis. CONCLUSIONS:Our data indicate that the genetic architecture and natural history of FCS and MCS are different. FCS expressed the most severe clinical phenotype as determined by resistance to triglyceride-lowering medications and higher incidence of acute pancreatitis episodes. The most common genetic abnormality underlying FCS was represented by biallelic mutations in LPL while APOA5 variants, in combination with high rare polygenic burden, were the most frequent genotype of MCS.",

Two novel pathogenic mutations on DDC gene [p.Tyr37Thrfs*5 (c.105delC) and p.F237S (c.710 T>C)] were associated with undetectable enzyme activity in plasma and only a mild reduction of biogenic amines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Monogenic developmental disorders of the heart and vessels are highly valuable to study the physiological and pathological processes in cardiovascular system homeostasis. The arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is a rare, autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder showing lengthening, tortuosity, and stenosis of the large arteries, with a propensity for aneurysm formation. In histopathology, it associates with fragmentation and disorganization of elastic fibers in several tissues, including the arterial wall. ATS is caused by pathogenic variants in SLC2A10 encoding the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT)10. Critical Issues: Although several hypotheses have been forwarded, the molecular mechanisms linking disrupted GLUT10 activity with arterial malformations are largely unknown. Recent Advances: The vascular and systemic manifestations and natural history of ATS patients have been largely delineated. GLUT10 was identified as an intracellular transporter of dehydroascorbic acid, which contributes to collagen and elastin cross-linking in the endoplasmic reticulum, redox homeostasis in the mitochondria, and global and gene-specific methylation/hydroxymethylation affecting epigenetic regulation in the nucleus. We revise here the current knowledge on ATS and the role of GLUT10 within the compartmentalization of ascorbate in physiological and diseased states. Future Directions: Centralization of clinical, treatment, and outcome data will enable better management for ATS patients. Establishment of representative animal disease models could facilitate the study of pathomechanisms underlying ATS. This might be relevant for other forms of vascular dysplasia, such as isolated aneurysm formation, hypertensive vasculopathy, and neovascularization. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 00, 000-000.",

FSS is often confused with other congenital contracture syndromes and, as a result, the clinical characteristics and natural history are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to analyze the presentation, natural history, and outcome of a cohort of individuals ascertained using strict diagnostic criteria for FSS. METHODS: Data from questionnaires, medical charts, examination, and photographs were analyzed to describe the physical features, therapeutic interventions, and functional outcomes in 73 individuals referred with the diagnosis of FSS. RESULTS: Only 32 referred cases (approximately 40%) met diagnostic criteria for FSS. In addition to contractures, common features in these cases included severe scoliosis (85%), strabismus (42%), and hearing loss (30%). Most infants required supplementary feedings via a nasogastric (45%) or gastrostomy tube (17%). Children walked by an average age of 19 months, but approximately 80% required ambulation-assist devices. An average of approximately 10 surgeries was performed on each child, and anesthetic and/or surgical complications were reported in 50% of individuals. All individuals were cognitively normal. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics and natural history of FSS distinguish it from other forms of arthrogryposis, yet FSS is frequently misdiagnosed. Children with FSS require considerable nutritional, surgical, and rehabilitative intervention. Such intensive therapeutic demands differ substantially from most other congenital contracture syndromes. These findings underscore the necessity of making an accurate diagnosis.",

METHODS:A six-state Markov state-transition model to model natural history of disease and difference in the interventional effect of surgeries depending on patch type implanted. Patches differed regarding their probability of re-operation due to patch calcification, based on a systematic literature review. Transition probabilities were based on the published literature, other clinical inputs were based on UK registry data, and cost data were based on UK sources and the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was determined as incremental costs per quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained. We used a 40-year analytic time-horizon and adopted the payer perspective. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS:According to the model predictions, CardioCel was associated with reduced incidence of re-operation, increased QALY, and costs savings compared to all other patches. Cost savings were greatest compared to synthetic patches. Estimated cost savings associated with CardioCel were greatest within atrioventricular septal defect repair and lowest for ventricular septal defect repair.

In most cases, there is a membrane (usually muscular) just below the aortic valve which causes a fixed obstruction to the blood flow across the left ventricular outflow tract. Despite being classified as a congenital heart defect, the fact that it is rare at birth and infancy, its gradual course and its high rate of postoperative recurrence propose that it may be an acquired defect. Anatomy The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve along with the intravalvular fibrosa form the posterolateral border and the muscular and membranous portions of the intraventricular septum form the anteromedial borders of the left ventricular outflow tract. Anatomic Variants There is a spectrum of variants of subvalvular aortic stenosis that occurs alone or in combination with the others. These are as follows: 1. A thin discrete membrane: The most common lesion. 2. A fibromuscular ridge  3. A diffuse fibromuscular tunnel-like narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract  (LVOT)[1],[2]. 4. Accessory or anomalous mitral valve tissue. In most patients, membrane attached to the ventricular septum or encompassing the left ventricular outflow tract causes the obstruction.[3],[4],[5]. Its position is anywhere from immediately below the aortic valve to further down into the left ventricle. The base of the aortic valve leaflets is noted to be involved by this subaortic tissue thus restricting the mobility and adding to the left ventricular outflow tract. Natural History As mentioned previously, the course of subvalvular aortic stenosis is gradual. It is rarely an isolated presentation. SAS is associated with congenital heart defects including a ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, bicuspid aortic valve, abnormal left ventricular papillary muscle, atrioventricular septal defect, among others. In the majority of the patients, SAS is incidentally found when evaluating patients for other congenital heart defects.",

Pruritus affected the majority of patients (59%-88%, of whom up to 45% had severe pruritus) and manifested during the first 10 years of life. Children with ALGS had significantly impaired HRQoL compared with healthy controls and those with other diseases. Itching was the symptom that most affected children with ALGS. No study assessed the economic burden of ALGS. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings consolidate information on the clinical course of ALGS, and highlight gaps in knowledge, most notably the absence of any research on the economic consequences of the disease. Further research is needed to establish the incidence of genetically confirmed ALGS. Disease-specific tools are also needed to improve the measurement of symptoms, such as itching, and better understand the impact of ALGS on HRQoL.",

STUDY DESIGN:The Clinical Registry Investigating BBS, a worldwide registry exploring the phenotype and natural history of BBS, was used to conduct the study. Protected health information was obtained by subject or family interview and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-approved release of data including imaging studies and genetic testing. Echocardiography and imaging findings were independently confirmed by 2 cardiologists. RESULTS:Thoraco-abdominal abnormalities were identified in 6 of 368 (1.6%) subjects with a minimum prevalence of 1 in 60 Clinical Registry Investigating BBS participants. Diverse laterality defects were observed suggesting that the underlying ciliopathy randomly alters embryonic left-right axis orientation. Congenital heart disease, common in heterotaxy, was present in 2 subjects. Additional defects, uncommonly reported in BBS, were observed in the central nervous, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems in the subjects. No BBS genotype was favored in the cohort. One subject had genetic and clinical phenotype diagnostic of both primary ciliary dyskinesia and BBS. CONCLUSIONS:The variety of thoraco-abdominal abnormalities in BBS suggests the pleiotropic nature of these anomalies is not confined to a single pattern or genotype. Clinicians providing care to individuals with BBS should consider the increased prevalence of thoraco-abdominal anomalies in BBS. Individuals with features suggestive of other ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, should undergo further evaluation for additional genetic disorders.

Newfoundland's geography, settlement, and socioeconomic development have produced a population useful for the study of genetic diseases. This review examines the clinical and genetic epidemiologic studies of inherited renal diseases undertaken in this population in the past 15 years. Common founder effects and large families through each generation provided very extensive pedigrees with autosomal-dominant diseases, such as polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and von Hippel-Lindau disease. In the former disease the diagnostic utility of renal ultrasound was determined, as was the prognostic impact of genotype, the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the pre-hypertensive phase, the potential for somatic mutations of the PKD2 gene, or the combination of mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, in single cells to induce cysts, and the demonstration that human transheterozygotes of PKD1 and -2 are not embryonically lethal. The presence of multiple genetic isolates and the high coefficient of kinship have predisposed to autosomal recessive diseases such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), autosomal-recessive PKD, primary hyperoxaluria, and dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis. We have reported the clinical manifestations and natural history of the BBS, with particular emphasis on the fact that renal abnormalities are cardinal manifestations of the disease, the presence of at least six different genotypes, the identity and function of the BBS6 gene, and the presence of three different BBS6 mutations. Because of its relatively homogenous origins and high coefficient of kinship, Newfoundland's population also may be useful for the study of complex diseases such as preeclampsia. Using unbiased ascertainment and strict diagnostic criteria, we have found a significant risk of preeclampsia and non-proteinuric gestational hypertension in sisters of probands with preeclampsia, particularly when probands are defined by severity of preeclampsia, an observation that supports a study to search for susceptibility genes. We conclude that collaborations between clinical epidemiologists and molecular geneticists, using the Newfoundland population, have provided important clinical and mechanistic insights into inherited renal diseases.",

In a prospective cohort study, 38 patients with the syndrome and 58 unaffected siblings were identified. Patients were studied in 1987 and again in 1993. Age of onset of blindness, hypertension, diabetes, renal impairment, and death was determined. The prevalence of obesity, gonadal dysfunction, and renal structural abnormalities was assessed. All but 5 BBS patients (86%) were legally blind, 26% being blind by the age of 13 years and 50% by 18 years. Eighty-eight percent were above the 90th percentile for height and weight. Twenty-five (66%) patients had hypertension, 25% of BBS patients by age 26 years, and 50% by age 34 years, whereas in the unaffected group, 25% had hypertension by age 49 years (P < 0.0001).

While the full genotype-phenotype spectrum remains to be explored, pathogenic variants in MSTO1 have recently been reported in a small number of patients presenting with a phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, congenital muscle involvement with histologic findings ranging from myopathic to dystrophic and pigmentary retinopathy. The proposed underlying pathogenic mechanism of MSTO1-related disease is suggestive of impaired mitochondrial fusion secondary to a loss of function of MSTO1. Disorders of mitochondrial fusion and fission have been shown to also lead to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, linking them to the mtDNA depletion syndromes, a clinically and genetically diverse class of mitochondrial diseases characterized by a reduction of cellular mtDNA content. However, the consequences of pathogenic variants in MSTO1 on mtDNA maintenance remain poorly understood. We present extensive phenotypic and genetic data from 12 independent families, including 15 new patients harbouring a broad array of bi-allelic MSTO1 pathogenic variants, and we provide functional characterization from seven MSTO1-related disease patient fibroblasts. Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in MSTO1 manifest clinically with a remarkably consistent phenotype of childhood-onset muscular dystrophy, corticospinal tract dysfunction and early-onset non-progressive cerebellar atrophy. MSTO1 protein was not detectable in the cultured fibroblasts of all seven patients evaluated, suggesting that pathogenic variants result in a loss of protein expression and/or affect protein stability. Consistent with impaired mitochondrial fusion, mitochondrial networks in fibroblasts were found to be fragmented. Furthermore, all fibroblasts were found to have depletion of mtDNA ranging from 30 to 70% along with alterations to mtDNA nucleoids. Our data corroborate the role of MSTO1 as a mitochondrial fusion protein and highlight a previously unrecognized link to mtDNA regulation. As impaired mitochondrial fusion is a recognized cause of mtDNA depletion syndromes, this novel link to mtDNA depletion in patient fibroblasts suggests that MSTO1-deficiency should also be considered a mtDNA depletion syndrome. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into the disease pathogenesis associated with MSTO1 mutations and further define the clinical spectrum and the natural history of MSTO1-related disease.",

It can have variable clinical severity and there is limited information on the natural history of this condition, clinical presentation according to genotype and effectiveness of newborn screening. METHODS:Retrospective data (growth parameters, morbidity, biochemical and genetic testing results) were collected from patients with VLCAD deficiency, to evaluate biochemical and clinical outcomes. Descriptive statistics was used for qualitative variables, while linear regression analysis was used to correlate continuous variables. RESULTS:VLCAD deficiency (screened by measuring elevated levels of C14:1-carnitine in blood spots) was more frequent in Utah than the national average (1:27,617 versus 1:63,481) in the first ten years of screening. Twenty-six patients had a confirmed diagnosis of VLCAD deficiency using DNA testing or functional studies. The c.848T>C (p.V283A) variant in the ACADVL gene was the most frequent in our population. Novel variants (c.623-21A>G (IVS7-21A>G); c.1052C>T (p.T351I); c.1183-7A>G (IVS11-7A>G); c.1281G>C (p.W427C); c.1923G>C (p.L641F); c.1924G>A (p.V642M)) were identified in this study, with their pathogenicity remaining unclear in most cases. C14:1-carnitine levels decreased with age and significantly correlated with CK levels as index of muscle involvement. There were no cases of HELLP syndrome nor liver disease during pregnancies in the mothers of VLCAD patients. None of our patients developed cardiac involvement after birth and all patients had normal growth parameters while on treatment. Clinical manifestations were related to concomitant infections and altered biochemical parameters. DISCUSSION:VLCAD deficiency can be identified by neonatal screening. Most patients compliant with therapy normalized biochemical parameters and had no major clinical manifestations. Complications were completely prevented with a relatively low number of pre-emptive ER visits or hospital admissions. It remains unclear whether neonatal screening is now identifying less severely affected patient or if complications will arise as subjects become older. Observation beyond puberty is necessary to fully understand the impact of VLCAD deficiency on morbidity in patients with VLCAD deficiency.",

To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33.

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]",

Based on the ISGBD criteria, the point prevalence of BD was 6.2 per 100,000 population. The most common clinical manifestation was oral aphthosis (100%) followed by genital aphthosis (92%) and skin lesions (92%), arthralgia/arthritis (40%), ocular involvement (32%), vascular thrombosis (12%) and pathergy phenomenon (8%). Only 1 patient was HLA-B*51 positive. A long-term multidisciplinary approach that included physician specialists, nurse specialists, and general practitioners was adopted for ongoing patient care. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence of BD in Ireland is higher than previously reported with a significant proportion experiencing laryngeal destruction. There are many similarities as well as several differences in the epidemiology of BD by country and indeed within countries. We fully advocate the need for national and international collaborative efforts in order to further understand the complex aetiology and immunopathology of BD in order to improve the clinical, physical, psychological wellbeing of patients.",

The demographic data of the selected patients including previous chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy (RT), hormonal therapy (HT), drugs used for BD, history of thrombotic events, and overall survival were examined. Results:The rate of BD in the entire cohort was found to be 0.25% (12/4800), and all had early BC at the time of BC diagnosis, with a median age of 47 years (range: 38-51). All patients underwent curative surgery for BC. In the adjuvant setting, CT, RT, and HT were administered in 11 (91%), 10 (83.4%), and 9 (75%) patients, respectively. All patients received acetylsalicylic acid and colchicine for BD. No serious adverse event associated with BC and/or BD was observed.

Infantile hemangiomas, in general, are the most common head and neck tumor in children, affecting 4-5% of the pediatric population. This retrospective cohort study characterizes subglottic infantile hemangiomas at a single vascular anomaly center over a 5-year period (2013-2017) during the era of propranolol treatment. METHODS:Queried the Vascular Anomaly Database at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for all infantile hemangioma(s) and then identified case of subglottic hemangiomas. Characterized key features of presentation, natural history and management for subglottic hemangiomas. A secondary differentiation focused on differences between subglottic hemangiomas associated with Beard Distribution (BD) vs not (NBD). RESULTS:Analysis of 761 cases of infantile hemangiomas demonstrated only 13 patients with subglottic hemangiomas (1.7%). Of those 13 patients, only 4 patients (30%) had BD while 2 patients (15%) had other cutaneous hemangiomas and 7 patients (55%) had no cutaneous hemangiomas. Secondarily, a total of 31 case of beard distribution cutaneous hemangiomas with 11 patients having oropharyngeal involvement (35%) but only 4 patients with subglottic hemangiomas (13%). Interestingly, 2 of the 4 BD patients had treatment failure on propranolol and required second line treatment with steroids or surgical excision while only 1 of 9 NBD patients failed propranolol treatment. As well the same 2 BD patients which failed propranolol also had PHACES syndrome. CONCLUSION:Subglottic hemangiomas are a rare presentation of infantile hemangiomas but with significant morbidity. While the classic teaching that a segmental beard distribution hemangioma raises concern for a subglottic hemangioma, this cohort indicates subglottic hemangiomas occur in a NBD presentation (1.3%), and demonstrated only an approximate 10% incidence rate with a beard distribution. But more importantly, this study raises the question that beard distribution in setting of PHACES syndrome may herald a more recalcitrant and complicated natural history for a subglottic hemangioma. This is of significant concern as risk for CVA in setting of PHACES is highest with use of steroid treatment. None of our patients had high risk extra or intra cranial vascular arterial anomalies and no CVA were noted.",

The end point was the proportion of patients remaining in complete remission for at least 3 years after withdrawal of anti-TNF treatment.In our BD cohort comprising 87 patients, 29 were eligible for analysis. All of these patients had disease that was refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy and had received successful anti-TNF treatment for a median of 2 years (interquartile range [IQR] 1.1-2.0) before treatment discontinuation. Of these patients, 12 (41%) achieved the study end point. The remaining 17 patients experienced a relapse within 1 year (IQR 0.6-1.5) after discontinuation. Re-treatment with anti-TNF was safe and effective in 14 (82%) of 17 patients; so far, 4 of these patients also achieved the study end point. Overall, 16 patients have remained in complete remission (median 6.5 years [IQR 5.5-8]). Ten of these patients are in drug-free remission (treated with anti-TNF agents, mainly for sight-threatening disease), and 6 are in azathioprine-maintained remission (treated with anti-TNF agents for ocular, intestinal, or central nervous system involvement). Notably, patients in drug-free remission were significantly younger and had a significantly shorter duration of BD when anti-TNF treatment was initiated compared to patients receiving azathioprine maintenance treatment.Drug-free, long-term remission after withdrawal of successful anti-TNF treatment is feasible in patients with severe BD. Because an anti-TNF agent-induced ""cure"" cannot be differentiated from spontaneous remission by natural history, prospective studies should examine whether anti-TNF agents should be used as first-line treatment for the induction of remission in every patient with vital organ involvement.",

Confounding factors may relate to stringency of inflammatory disease diagnosis and the effect of therapeutic intervention for RA on periodontal disease. These factors are investigated in this study. METHODS:Forty-five individuals with documented RA (n = 15), spondyloarthropathy (n = 15), and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) (n = 15), from the Hamann-Todd collection of human skeletons compiled from 1912 to 1938, and 15 individuals contemporarily incorporated in the collection were examined for tooth loss, cavity occurrence, average and maximum lingual and buccal depth of space between tooth and bone, periosteal reaction, serpentine bone resorption, abscess formation, and root penetration of the bone surface and analyzed by analysis of variance. RESULTS:Tooth loss was common, but actual number of teeth lost, cavity occurrence, average and maximum lingual and buccal depth of space between tooth and bone, periosteal reaction, serpentine grooving surrounding teeth (considered a sign of inflammation), abscess formation, and root exposure (penetration of bone surface) were indistinguishable among controls and individuals with RA, spondyloarthropathy, and CPPD. CONCLUSIONS:Although many factors can affect periodontal disease, presence of inflammatory arthritis does not appear to be one of them. The implication is that dental disease was common in the general population and not necessarily associated with arthritis, at least before the advent of modern rheumatologic medications. As specific diagnosis did not affect prevalence, perhaps current prevalence controversy may relate to current intervention, a subject for further study.",

STUDY DESIGN:In this multicentre study, prospective follow-up data were collected from 103 subjects with non-HIV-associated lipodystrophy registered in the Turkish Lipodystrophy Study Group database to study renal complications in treatment naïve patients with lipodystrophy. METHODS:Main outcome measures included ascertainment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by studying the level of proteinuria and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Kidney volume was measured. Percutaneous renal biopsies were performed in 9 patients. RESULTS:Seventeen of 37 patients with generalized and 29 of 66 patients with partial lipodystrophy had CKD characterized by proteinuria, of those 12 progressed to renal failure subsequently. The onset of renal complications was significantly earlier in patients with generalized lipodystrophy. Patients with CKD were older and more insulin resistant and had worse metabolic control. Increased kidney volume was associated with poor metabolic control and suppressed leptin levels. Renal biopsies revealed thickening of glomerular basal membranes, mesangial matrix abnormalities, podocyte injury, focal segmental sclerosis, ischaemic changes and tubular abnormalities at various levels. Lipid vacuoles were visualized in electron microscopy images. CONCLUSIONS:CKD is conspicuously frequent in patients with lipodystrophy which has an early onset. Renal involvement appears multifactorial. While poorly controlled diabetes caused by severe insulin resistance may drive the disease in some cases, inherent underlying genetic defects may also lead to cell autonomous mechanisms contributory to the pathogenesis of kidney disease.",

Although generally benign, CFTD has a variable natural course and severe progression has been observed in some patients. The pathogenesis of the disorder is unknown and many authors consider CFTD a syndrome with multiple aetiologies rather than a separate clinical entity. A positive family history has been reported in about 40% of cases, but the inheritance pattern is not clear. Both autosomal recessive and dominant modes of inheritance have been suggested. The present paper describes a large, multigenerational kindred that has an inherited myopathy fulfilling the histological criteria of CFTD, with autosomal dominant transmission and high penetrance. The clinical picture, remarkably similar in all affected family members, started in early infancy with mild limb muscle weakness. There was slow progression of symptoms into adulthood, with moderate to severe, mainly proximal, muscle weakness without loss of ambulation. Muscle biopsy from two affected individuals demonstrated predominance of small type 1 muscle fibres without other significant findings. Nerve conduction studies were normal and needle electromyography showed a myopathic pattern. MRI examination performed on three patients from successive generations showed involvement of proximal limb and paraspinal muscles. The clinical and pathological homogeneity in the present family, together with the lack of additional histological abnormalities after decades of disease progression in two affected individuals, supports this being a distinct myopathy with fibre type disproportion. Whether the disease in this family can be regarded as a form of the congenital myopathy known as CFTD or rather a unique condition sharing histological features with CFTD needs further investigation. This is, to our knowledge, the largest kindred with muscle fibre type disproportion reported to date.

Because few data exist on its natural history, we wanted to investigate the prognosis of abdominal pain in children in general practice. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study of children (aged 4 to 17 years) complaining of abdominal pain, follow-up was at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using standardized questionnaires. The primary outcome measure was chronic abdominal pain: abdominal pain at least 1 time a month during at least 3 consecutive months that had an impact on daily activities. Prevalence, incidence, and duration of chronic abdominal pain were assessed. RESULTS: Three hundred five children (116 boys, 189 girls), with a median age of 7.8 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 5.7-10.5 years) were included. Chronic abdominal pain was present in 142 (46.6%) children at an initial visit to the primary care physician for this complaint. During follow-up, 78.7% fulfilled the criteria for chronic abdominal pain at 1 or more follow-up points. Among 163 children at risk for developing chronic abdominal pain, the cumulative incidence of chronic abdominal pain was 60.1% (95% CI, 52.1%-67.7%) and was higher in girls than in boys (RR = 1.23; 95% CI, 0.94-1.61).

Children with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome seemed to have a less favorable prognosis compared with children with symptoms of functional dyspepsia or functional abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and development of chronic abdominal pain is common and of long duration among children consulting in primary care for abdominal pain.

Recently it was demonstrated that in some patients the disease is caused by mutations in the SLC52A3 gene which encodes the intestinal (hRFT2) riboflavin transporter. In these patients riboflavin deficiency is the cause of the BVVL/FL syndrome and supplementation of riboflavin proved a life saving treatment. Mutations in the SLC52A2 gene and the SLC52A1 (GPR172B) gene, coding for human riboflavin transporters hRFT3 and hRFT1 have been associated with the BVVL syndrome as well. We performed a review of the literature, with emphasis on the natural history and the effects of treatment in these patients. A total of 35 publications were traced reporting on the clinical presentation of 74 patients who presented before age 18. The most prevalent symptoms were bulbar palsy, hearing loss, facial weakness and respiratory compromise. Death was reported in 28 of the 61 untreated patients, with a very low survival in patients presenting before age 4. All 13 patients who were treated with riboflavin survived, with a strong clinical improvement after days to months of treatment in eight patients. Three patients demonstrated a stable clinical course and treatment was stopped early in two patients. Abnormalities in plasma flavin levels and/or plasma acylcarnitine profiles were observed in some but not in all patients, and also patients with normal plasma flavin levels and acylcarnitine profiles demonstrated a striking clinical improvement on riboflavin supplementation. It is now clear that proper diagnosis requires mutation analysis of all three transporter genes and treatment should be started immediately without first awaiting results of molecular analysis. Clinical improvement may be rapid or gradual over a period of more than 12 months.",

Despite being a leading cause of graft failure, glomerular disease (GD) recurrence remains poorly understood, due to heterogeneity in disease pathogenesis and clinical presentation, reliance on histopathology to confirm disease recurrence, and the low incidence of individual GD subtypes. Large, international cohorts of patients with GD are urgently needed to better understand the disease pathophysiology, predictors of recurrence, and response to therapy. METHODS:The Post-TrANsplant GlOmerular Disease (TANGO) study is an observational, multicenter cohort study initiated in January 2017 that aims to: 1) characterize the natural history of GD after KT, 2) create a biorepository of saliva, blood, urine, stools and kidney tissue samples, and 3) establish a network of patients and centers to support novel therapeutic trials. The study includes 15 centers in America and Europe. Enrollment is open to patients with biopsy-proven GD prior to transplantation, including IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, dense-deposit disease, C3 glomerulopathy, complement- and IgG-positive membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I-III (old classification). During phase 1, patient data will be collected in an online database. The biorepository (phase 2) will involve collection of samples from patients for identification of predictors of recurrence, biomarkers of disease activity or response to therapy, and novel pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, through phase 3, we will use our multicenter network of patients and centers to launch interventional studies. DISCUSSION:Most prior studies of post-transplant GD recurrence are single-center and retrospective, or rely upon registry data that frequently misclassify the cause of kidney disease. Systematically determining GD recurrence rates and predictors of clinical outcomes is essential to improving post-transplant outcomes. Furthermore, accurate molecular phenotyping and biomarker development will allow better understanding of individual GD pathogenesis, and potentially identify novel drug targets for GD in both native and transplanted kidneys. The TANGO study has the potential to tackle GD recurrence through a multicenter design and a comprehensive biorepository.",

Biopsies were scored according to the Oxford Classification. The primary outcomes were renal survival or a rapid loss of renal function defined as a decline in eGFR of >5 ml/min/year.237 patients with IgAN were identified with a mean follow-up of 82 months. 200 had biopsies available for review, of which 156 were adequate for scoring using the Oxford Classification. 9/156 patients (5.8 %) received some immunosuppressive therapy, mostly for unrelated conditions: these were excluded. In multivariate COX regression, including histological and clinical data, the only independent predictors of time to ESRD were baseline eGFR (HR 0.96 per ml/min increase, p = 0.018), baseline proteinuria (HR 1.36 per doubling, p = 0.004) and endocapillary hypercellularity (HR 4.75 for E1 compared to E0, p < 0.001).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted an observational retrospective study of six patients with CBD who received prolonged corticosteroid treatment with a mean pulmonary function test follow-up period of 10.1 years. Five of the six patients were exposed to beryllium at the same workplace. The diagnosis in four of the six cases was confirmed by a positive beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test result on blood or BAL fluid. Periodic pulmonary function tests were analyzed in relation to removal from beryllium exposure and treatment with corticosteroids. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Two broad patterns of response were noted in these patients. The first pattern seen in two patients showed no improvement in FVC or diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) with corticosteroids. However, a significant improvement in these parameters was noted on cessation of beryllium exposure in one of the two patients. The second pattern showed an initial improvement in FVC and Dlco with corticosteroids, which was not sustained. An improvement was noted on stopping beryllium exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The response to long-term corticosteroids in CBD, quite like that in sarcoidosis, is variable.

Because of its strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, and nuclear properties, beryllium products are used in the aerospace, automotive, energy, medical, and electronics industries. What eventually came to be known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD) was first identified in the 1940s, when a cluster of cases was observed in workers from the fluorescent light industry. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission recommended the first 8-hour occupational exposure limit (OEL) for beryllium of 2.0 microg/m3 in 1949, which was later reviewed and accepted by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the vast majority of countries and standard-setting bodies worldwide. The 2.0 microg/m3 standard has been in use by the beryllium industry for more than 50 years and has been considered adequate to protect workers against clinical CBD. Recently, improved diagnostic techniques, including immunological testing and safer bronchoscopy, have enhanced our ability to identify subclinical CBD cases that would have formerly remained unidentified. Some recent epidemiological studies have suggested that some workers may develop CBD at exposures less than 2.0 microg/m3. ACGIH is currently reevaluating the adequacy of the current 2.0 microg/m3 guideline, and a plethora of research initiatives are under way to provide a better understanding of the cause of CBD. The research is focusing on the risk factors and exposure metrics that could be associated with CBD, as well as on efforts to better characterize the natural history of CBD. There is growing evidence that particle size and chemical form may be important factors that influence the risk of developing CBD. These research efforts are expected to provide data that will help identify a scientifically based OEL that will protect workers against CBD.",

However, a very large expansion of covered metabolic disorders eluded Guthrie despite his best efforts. This required a new screening technology, tandem mass spectrometry, which was not available until recently.

This review aims to assess the evidence for the appropriateness of such programmes. METHODS:A formal systematic literature review was conducted. Exclusion and inclusion criteria were used to select papers for critical appraisal by pairs of reviewers. Standard criteria were used to assess the appropriateness of neonatal screening for various IEMs. Site visits were conducted to assess new technologies for newborn screening. RESULTS:A total of 1866 papers were identified and 407 systematically selected for full critical appraisal. Published evidence confirmed that universal newborn screening for phenylketonuria (PKU) meets all of the screening criteria and justifies the expense and infrastructure necessary for the collection and testing of neonatal blood spots. There was insufficient evidence in the literature to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening for any other IEMs. There was reasonable evidence to support inclusion in extended neonatal screening of four other IEMs: biotinidase deficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). CONCLUSIONS:Large-scale trials of screening for biotinidase, CAH, MCAD and GA1 should be conducted, with careful evaluation to establish their clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in practice. Screening for the latter two disorders would be dependent upon the use of tandem mass spectrometry (tandem MS). The application of tandem MS to newborn screening requires further evaluation.

The theory behind developmental origins of adult health and disease suggests that there are mammalian epigenetic fetal survival mechanisms that downregulate fetal growth, both in order for the fetus to survive until birth and to prepare it for a restricted extra-uterine environment, and that these mechanisms have long lasting effects on the adult health of the individual. Silver-Russell syndrome phenotype has recently been recognized to be related to imprinting/methylation defects. Perhaps all eight syndromes, including those with single gene mutation origin, involve the mammalian mechanism(s) of fetal survival downsizing.

The natural history of PCOS, as well as hypotheses regarding its etiology, facilitates employment of the case-control study design. However, a review of the literature suggested that inconsistency of research findings in relation to the etiology of PCOS might be, in part, due to the different choice of controls for case-control design and application. DESIGN: Investigators have often employed ""healthy"" control groups and neglected to consider the tenability of the ""rare disease"" assumption in the analysis when instituting the case-control strategy. This might result in the introduction of a positive bias or overestimation of odds ratios, producing an effect estimate that is more extreme than that in the underlying population. Using several quantitative, though hypothetical, literature-driven examples, this bias is described and demonstrated. In addition, recommendations are provided with regard to case-sampling strategy when the rare disease assumption is untenable, as it may frequently be in studies of PCOS.

Osteotomies with external fixation (hexapodes) are still the most recommended corrective treatment in this condition. SUMMARY:Little is known about the origin and natural history of Blount disease. Treatment is always surgical and, given their complexity, should be preceded by a thorough analysis and planning regarding all deformities. Treatment principles are to correct the three-dimensional deformity and avoid recurrence. The choice of technique mainly depends on patient maturity and severity. Guided growth is a good choice for more immature patients with moderate deformities. Progressive correction using osteotomy or physeal distraction is indicated for patients with severe deformities and low remaining growth.

Perceptual estimates of spatial resolution driven by rods, S-cones, and L/M-cones were obtained by the choice of chromatic gratings presented on varied adapting conditions with a modified microperimeter. Results:Both genotypes had abnormal foveal photoreceptor structure early in life. Patients with the C203R mutation, however, had decades-longer persistence of foveal photoreceptor outer nuclear layer thickness and a slower rate of development of inner segment/outer segment defects than did patients with large deletion mutations. At late ages, both genotypes had comparably severe losses of central structure. At the rod-rich hot spot, there was no difference in structure between cohorts with age. Grating acuities in all BCM patients were driven by S-cones and rods; the foveal structural differences were not reflected in a difference between cohorts in visual sensitivity and spatial resolution. Conclusions:A difference in structural phenotype due to the C203R mutation versus large deletion mutations in BCM was detected as a more prolonged persistence of foveal photoreceptor structure in patients with the missense mutation.

Its incidence in Spain today is very low.We report the case of three members of a family living together who presented a clinical picture of food-borne botulism.

Viljoen's lifelong grudge for receiving  insufficient credit from Theiler for his research contribution was justified are analysed in this  paper. By 1912, Theiler knew that Duncan Hutcheon had advocated the use of bonemeal as  a prophylactic against the disease in the early 1880s. Hutcheon's colleague, J.D. Borthwick,  had shown conclusively in a field experiment in 1895 that lamsiekte did not occur in cattle  fed a liberal allowance of bonemeal; and bone-craving had been identified by Hutcheon and  several farmers as being associated with the occurrence of the disease (a 'premonitory' sign).  Hutcheon regarded a phosphate deficiency of the pastures as the direct cause of lamsiekte.  However, Theiler did not accept this, was convinced that intoxication was involved and  developed a 'grass toxin' theory. Viljoen (1918) also latched onto the grass toxin theory.  He did not believe that osteophagia existed, stating categorically that he had not observed  it on the experimental farm Armoedsvlakte where &gt; 100 cases of lamsiekte had occurred  during the &gt; 3 years that he spent there. Moreover, he did not believe in the prophylactic  value of bonemeal. However, careful analysis of a subsequent publication, of which he was a  co-author, revealed that in late 1918 and early 1919 he reproduced the disease by drenching  cattle with blowfly pupae and larvae as well as with crushed bones from decomposing bovine  carcasses. For this breakthrough he did not get proper credit from Theiler. Reappointed to  study lamsiekte on Armoedsvlakte in the autumn of 1919, Theiler, probably already aware  that the toxin he was seeking was in the decomposing bones or carcass material rather than  the grass, deliberately 'walked with the cattle' on the farm to encounter a classic manifestation  of bone-craving (osteophagia). The penny then immediately dropped. Theiler, actually  rationalising an hypothesis that was about four decades old, did so with a vengeance. Within  less than two years he had reproduced lamsiekte by exposing cattle with natural bone-craving  to rotten carcass material, had chemical proof that the grazing was phosphorus-deficient, had  developed a satisfactory bonemeal prophylactic dosage programme, and the bacterial toxin  concerned - perhaps the trickiest contribution - had been produced in culture. Hence the table  was set for the later development of an excellent lamsiekte vaccine.",

Analysis of clinical signs, feeding practice, vaccination history, and epidemic curves enabled us to define a study population in two outbreaks, where high doses of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type D (BoNT/D) were evenly consumed by the affected animal groups. Attack rates among unvaccinated 6- to 24-month-old heifers were 96% (55/57) and 85% (53/62).

In younger, unvaccinated 2- to 6-month-old calves, presumably protected by maternal antibodies, the attack rate was 24% (17/71). These differences correlated with significant differences in levels of specific anti-BoNT/D antibody in serum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

These toxins can cause a life threatening systemic toxicity whether through natural causes such as food poisoning, infant botulism, wound botulism, or through use as bio-terror agents (e.g. inhalational botulism). It was realised early on that standard reference botulinum antitoxins were required to reduce the variation between assays and ensure a consistent potency of therapeutic antitoxins and vaccines, and to define the serotype. This led to the International Unit being defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the 1960s with the establishment of the first International Standards (IS) for serotypes A-F. Since then botulinum antitoxin ISs have been used world wide as the 'yard stick' to measure the neutralising potency of antitoxins.

This focus stems from important advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of bone fragility, the natural history and predictors of fractures in chronic conditions, the use of bone-active medications in children, and the inclusion of bone health screening into clinical guidelines for high-risk populations. Given the historic focus on bone densitometry in this setting, the International Society for Clinical Densitometry published revised criteria in 2013 to define osteoporosis in the young, oriented towards prevention of overdiagnosis given the high frequency of extremity fractures during the growing years. This definition has been successful in avoiding an inappropriate diagnosis of osteoporosis in healthy children who sustain long bone fractures during play. However, its emphasis on the number of long bone fractures plus a concomitant bone mineral density (BMD) threshold ≤ -2.0, without consideration for long bone fracture characteristics (eg, skeletal site, radiographic features) or the clinical context (eg, known fracture risk in serious illnesses or physical-radiographic stigmata of osteoporosis), inappropriately misses clinically relevant bone fragility in some children. In this perspective, we propose a new approach to the definition and diagnosis of osteoporosis in children, one that balances the role of BMD in the pediatric fracture assessment with other important clinical features, including fracture characteristics, the clinical context and, where appropriate, the need to define the underlying genetic etiology as far as possible.",

RECENT FINDINGS:The introduction of next-generation sequencing technology has led to better understanding of the genetic cause of osteogenesis imperfecta and enabled cost-effective and timely diagnosis via expanded gene panels and exome or genome sequencing. Clinically, despite genetic heterogeneity, different forms of osteogenesis imperfecta share similar features that include connective tissue and systemic manifestations in addition to bone fragility. Thus, the goals of treatment in osteogenesis imperfecta extend beyond decreasing the risk of fracture, to include the maximization of growth and mobility, and the management of extraskeletal complications. The standard of care in pediatric patients is bisphosphonates therapy. Ongoing preclinical studies in osteogenesis imperfecta mouse models and clinical studies in individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta have been instrumental in the development of new and targeted therapeutic approaches, such as sclerostin inhibition and transforming growth factor-β inhibition.

Quantitative and qualitative parameters were compared between OI type III and type IV groups (unpaired t test) and the unaffected population (Z-score). 3D evaluation revealed a high prevalence of craniocervical abnormalities, craniofacial asymmetries, and nasal septum deviation in both OI groups. Mean airway dimensions were comparable to the non-affected population norms, except for 5 individuals who had insufficient airway dimensions.

Discussion groups with leaders of the adult OI community identified a broad range of medical priorities beyond fractures and brittle bones. Our work underscores the need to include patient-reported outcomes in rare bone disease research. INTRODUCTION:Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare genetic disorder affecting collagen protein leading to brittle bones and a number of other medical complications. To date, there is limited research which examines the life-long process of aging with this rare disease, much less the perspective of individuals with OI. METHODS:In order to explore and prioritize health concerns that adults with OI feel have been inadequately addressed in health care and research, investigators held discussions with leaders from the global adult OI community. The meetings were held in August 2017 at the 13th International Conference on OI in Oslo, Norway as part of the preconference seminar ""Patient Participation in OI Research"". Investigators were part of the Brittle Bone Disease Consortium (BBDC), a multicenter research program devoted to the study of OI, and their focus was on patient-reported outcomes (PRO). RESULTS:Participants noted that while fractures and brittle bones are the most common feature of OI, a number of body systems are under-studied in this disorder. They particularly emphasized breathing, hearing, and the effects of aging as primary concerns that researchers and physicians may not fully understand or address. Other areas included pain, gastrointestinal problems, mental health, nutrition, menopause/pregnancy, and basilar invagination. Participants also emphasized that they must be informed of study results. They underscored that outcome measures incorporated into future drug trials must look beyond fractures and consider the whole patient. CONCLUSIONS:This work will help guide the incorporation of PROs into the next phase of the BBDC Natural History Study of OI and underscores the importance of including PROs in the study of rare diseases.",

OBJECTIVES:Clinical and bone material description of non-lethal type VIII OI. DESIGN:Natural history study of type VIII OI. SETTING:Pediatric academic research centers. PATIENTS:Five patients with non-lethal type VIII OI, and one patient with lethal type VIII OI. INTERVENTIONS:None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Clinical examinations included bone mineral density, radiographs, and serum and urinary metabolites. Bone biopsy samples were analyzed for histomorphometry and bone mineral density distribution by quantitative backscattered electron imaging microscopy. Collagen biochemistry was examined by mass spectrometry, and collagen fibrils were examined by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS:Type VIII OI patients have extreme growth deficiency, an L1-L4 areal bone mineral density Z-score of -5 to -6, and normal bone formation markers. Collagen from bone and skin tissue and cultured osteoblasts and fibroblasts have nearly absent 3-hydroxylation (1-4%). Collagen fibrils showed abnormal diameters and irregular borders. Bone histomorphometry revealed decreased cortical width and very thin trabeculae with patches of increased osteoid, although the overall osteoid surface was normal. Quantitative backscattered electron imaging showed increased matrix mineralization of cortical and trabecular bone, typical of other OI types. However, the proportion of bone with low mineralization was increased in type VIII OI bone, compared to type VII OI. CONCLUSIONS:P3H1 is the unique enzyme responsible for collagen 3-hydroxylation in skin and bone. Bone from non-lethal type VIII OI children is similar to type VII, especially bone matrix hypermineralization, but it has distinctive features including extremely thin trabeculae, focal osteoid accumulation, and an increased proportion of low mineralized bone.",

They should be distinguished as a special group within the group of OI subjects with a progressively deforming OI phenotype delineated in previous publications [Sillence et al, 1979a, b]. The OI type III phenotype does not necessarily equate with progressively deforming OI, and probably only a proportion of cases with severe deformity and normal sclerae have OI type III. On the other hand, distinction between these patients and those with a milder form of perinatally lethal OI type II might be difficult.

Baseline characteristics of 289 consecutive probands (203 men; mean age 45 ± 16 years) with a Brugada type 1 electrocardiogram were analyzed. After a mean follow-up of 10.1 ± 4.6 years, 29 malignant arrhythmias occurred. On multivariate analysis, a history of VF and syncopal episodes, fragmented QRS (f-QRS), spontaneous type 1 electrocardiogram, and early repolarization pattern were significantly associated with later occurrence of VF/SCD. In patients with drug-induced BrS, the accentuation or de novo appearance of f-QRS in other leads was always associated with VF/SCD. Cerebrovascular events occurred in 8 patients with atrial fibrillation (15.1%), most of them (75%) presenting as the first clinical manifestation. The time-to-diagnosis was found to be significantly shorter in those patients who directly came to our center than in those who referred to our center for a second opinion. In conclusion, systematic use of the pharmacologic challenge in patients with unexplained cardiovascular symptoms and/or atrial fibrillation might significantly improve the identification of BrS with a shortening of the time-to-diagnosis. The CHA2DS2VASc score might be inappropriate for predicting transient ischemic attack or stroke in BrS. This study confirms the independent predictive value of previous VF and syncopal episodes, f-QRS, type 1 electrocardiogram, and early repolarization pattern. In BrS a sufficiently long follow-up is necessary before conclusions on prognosis are apparent.",

Broad adoption of such panels has begun to deliver on the promises of personalized medicine, but has also brought new challenges such as the presence of unexpected results, or results of uncertain clinical significance. Genetic analysis of inherited cardiac conditions is particularly challenging due to the extensive genetic heterogeneity underlying cardiac phenotypes, and the overlapping, variable, and incompletely penetrant nature of their clinical presentations. The design of effective diagnostic tests and the effective use of the results depend on a clear understanding of the relationship between each gene and each considered condition. To address these issues, we developed simple, systematic approaches to three fundamental challenges: (1) evaluating the strength of the evidence suggesting that a particular condition is caused by pathogenic variants in a particular gene, (2) evaluating whether unusual genotype/phenotype observations represent a plausible expansion of clinical phenotype associated with a gene, and (3) establishing a molecular diagnostic strategy to capture overlapping clinical presentations. These approaches focus on the systematic evaluation of the pathogenicity of variants identified in clinically affected individuals, and the natural history of disease in those individuals. Here, we applied these approaches to the evaluation of more than 100 genes reported to be associated with inherited cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia or cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, Brugada, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and to a set of related syndromes such as Noonan Syndrome and Fabry disease.

A detailed medical history was obtained on each patient via office chart review and patient interviews. We compared the histologic findings in skin biopsies from patients with PRP to those of biopsies matched for site and age from control patients with psoriasis. Certain aspects of the clinical presentations encountered in the study group patients have not been previously emphasized, including eruptions compatible with a vesiculobullous disorder in 4 patients. Several patients had evidence of underlying iatrogenic or systemic immune dysregulatory states and certain triggers could be isolated such as emotional stress and prior exposure to microbial pathogens. Histomorphologic features predictive of PRP included follicular plugging, an increased granular cell layer, and acantholysis. While seen in a minority of biopsies of PRP, morphologic discriminators supportive of a diagnosis of psoriasis included neutrophils in the parakeratotic scale crust, and dermal papillae capillary ectasia with vessels lying in direct apposition to the epidermis. Other morphologic features were encountered in biopsies of PRP which have received little emphasis in the dermatopathology literature, including epithelial atrophy, significant dermal inflammation, the presence of eosinophils and plasma cells within the inflammatory infiltrates, an abnormal granular cell layer, and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, albeit none were statistically signficant predictors of PRP over psoriasis. Nevertheless, their identification emphasizes the varied histologic spectrum of PRP. The almost ubiquitous finding of acantholysis and the presence of an abnormal granular cell layer in many biopsies of PRP suggests that abnormal keratins or defects in the retinol signalling pathway may be of pathogenetic importance.",

In this review, we describe the natural history, radiological features, proposed pathogenesis, and management options for this debilitating condition. RECENT FINDINGS:Since its first description in 1922, about 400 cases of melorheostosis have been reported, either as single reports or in small case series. Melorheostosis affects the appendicular skeleton more commonly than the axial skeleton and usually presents with lower limb deformity. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and radiological features that help differentiate this condition from other sclerosing bone dysplasias. LEM domain-containing protein 3 (LEMD3) gene mutations have been demonstrated in several familial cases, but these have been more strongly correlated with other hereditary dysplasias, such as osteopoikilosis, and are not thought to be the causative gene for melorheostosis. The exact etiology of classic sporadically occurring melorheostosis remains unknown, with possible causes being somatic LEMD3 mutations, somatic mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein/transforming growth factor-beta pathway, mutations in multiple genes, or other non-genetic causes. Management in recent years has involved nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates in addition to traditional orthopedic surgical approaches and physical therapy. Melorheostosis may present as mixed or atypical osseous involvement in addition to the classically described ""dripping candle wax"" appearance of hyperostosis. Some patients may have overlap with osteopoikilosis or Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome. In the future, better characterization of genetic and developmental factors predisposing to melorheostosis may lead to the development of targeted therapy for this condition, as well as for more commonly encountered skeletal abnormalities.",

It has also been used to measure the residual neurological deficit at the chronic stage after ischemic events. However, the value of NIHSS in ischemic cerebral small vessel disease has not been specifically evaluated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the link between the NIHSS score and clinical severity in a large population of subjects with CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), a unique model to investigate the pathophysiology and natural history of ischemic small vessel disease. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 220 patients with one or more lacunar infarcts confirmed by MRI examination and enrolled from a prospective cohort study were analyzed. Detailed neurological examinations, including evaluation of the NIHSS and modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) for evaluating the clinical severity, were performed in all subjects. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of various NIHSS thresholds to capture the absence of significant disability (mRS <3) were calculated. General linear models, controlling for age, educational level and different clinical manifestations frequently observed in CADASIL, were used to evaluate the relationships between NIHSS and clinical severity. RESULTS: In the whole cohort, 45 (20.5%) subjects presented with mRS ≥3, but only 16 (7.3%) had NIHSS >5. All but 1 subject with NIHSS >5 showed mRS ≥3. NIHSS ≤5 had an 85.3% positive predictive value for no or slight disability with only 33.3% specificity. The NIHSS, MMSE score and presence or absence of gait disturbances were found to be strongly and independently correlated with disability (all p < 0.001). Altogether, they accounted for 73% of the variance of mRS in contrast with the NIHSS alone accounting for only 50% of this variance. Among patients with NIHSS ≤5, subjects with mRS ≥3 showed a lower MMSE score than those with mRS <3 (p < 0.001). All patients with NIHSS ≤5 but with mRS ≥3 presented either with gait disturbances or MMSE score <25. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that the NIHSS cannot reflect the extent of neurological deficit and clinical severity in subjects with lacunar infarctions in the context of a chronic and diffuse small vessel disease. A specific and global neurological scale, including the assessment of cognitive and gait performances, should be developed for ischemic cerebral microangiopathy.",

RESULTS:We identified 105 symptomatic patients in 33 families. Vascular risk factors were uncommon, with hypertension reported in only 8 patients. The mean age of symptom onset was 36. 7+/-12.9 years. Stroke or transient ischemic attack was an initial symptom in 45 patients, with a mean age of onset of 41.2+/-9.2 years. Migraine was also a common initial symptom, reported by 42 patients at a younger mean age of 28.3+/-11.7 years. Other initial symptoms included depression in 9 patients, cognitive impairment in 6 patients, and seizures in 3 patients. Regarding clinical course, 71 patients experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack, and 52 of those patients had 1 or more recurrent ischemic events. Dementia was reported in 44 patients. Only 3 additional patients experienced migraine at a later time, while 13 additional patients developed depression. Six patients had seizures.

One of the most striking features is the early age of patients at the onset of the disease, showing swelling of the soft tissues overlaying bones, hyperirritability, and, subsequently, periosteal new bone production. The natural history of the disease proves to be self-limiting. Multiple areas are involved in the majority of cases. These polyostic forms are easily clinically diagnosed. But in rare monostic presentations, especially manifestations in the scapular region, there may be a great suspicion of a malignant tumor. Histologically, such lesion may also be misdiagnosed as a malignant neoplasm because of the great variety of microscopic appearances. This study was conducted into 5 cases (biopsies from one male and four female infants, 6 weeks to 4 months of age) to characterize the histological variability in the natural course of the disease. Electron microscopical investigations were additionally performed on two cases. Histologically, the process corresponds to typical ossifying periostitis. Three phases can be distinguished according to the main histological characteristics: 1. Acute inflammatory and proliferating phase; 2. Osteogenic phase; 3. Phase of remodelling. The first phase is characterized by a loss of periost, areas showing proliferation of fibroblast-like cells, and by edema of surrounding musculature. Infiltration by leucocytes was occasionally observed and was accompanied by micro-abscesses. The osteogenic phase was characterized by formation of woven bone. Ultrastructurally proliferations of osteogenic mesenchyma were found and resulted in typical mineralization patterns with matrix vesicles and interfibrillar depositions of hydroxyapatite crystals. Calcification of mitochondria was also detected. Viruses could not be observed. Only thread-like structures were found in the nuclei. At first interpretation, they appeared to be pathological protein depositions. However, further investigations will be necessary to elucidate their genesis. The pathogenesis is discussed. Biopsy still remains indicated in cases of an unclear course of monostic disease.",

The role of functional autoantibodies is leading to innovative approaches to evidence-based interventions and therapies that are based on mechanisms of disease.Despite substantial advances, the high morbidity and mortality that currently characterizes SSc can largely be attributed to a delay in diagnosis, gaps in our understanding of the role of autoantibodies in early disease, and limited effective therapeutic options.

OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the frequency and pattern of dystonia in a group of patients with atypical parkinsonism (multiple system atrophy - MSA, progressive supranuclear palsy - PSP, and corticobasal degeneration - CBD) and to investigate whether dystonia could be the first presenting symptom at disease onset in those patients. METHOD:A total of 38 medical charts were reviewed (n=23/MSA group; n=7/CBD group; n=8/PSP group) and data values were described as means/standard deviations. The variables evaluated were sex, age at onset, disease duration, first symptom, clinical features of dystonia and other neurological signs, response to levodopatherapy, Hoehn &Yahr -scale >3 after three years of disease, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. RESULTS:The overall frequency of dystonia in our sample was 50% with 30.4% (n=7) in the MSA group, 62.5% (n=5) in the PSP group, and 100% (n=8) in the CBD group. In none of these patients, dystonia was the first complaint. Several types of dystonia were found: camptocormia, retrocollis, anterocollis, blepharoespasm, oromandibular, and foot/hand dystonia. CONCLUSION:In our series, dystonia was a common feature in atypical parkinsonism (overall frequency of 50%) and it was part of the natural history although not the first symptom at disease onset. Neuroimaging abnormalities are not necessarily related to focal dystonia, and levodopa therapy did not influence the pattern of dystonia in our group of patients.",

Eight subjects reported the onset of leg pain in their teenage years that, by their early 20s, had either resolved or persisted at a low level. Two of these eight later developed cranial nerve palsies. There was a wide variation in the radiographic appearance in adults, but disease extent and activity in long bones, as assessed by scintigraphy, was inversely correlated with age (p < 0.025). In younger subjects the radiographic and scintigraphic appearances were concordant, but in older subjects the scintigram could be quiescent despite florid radiographic changes. Sequential scintigrams in two subjects showed reduced activity in the later scan. One subject had suffered meningoencephalitis in early childhood that resulted in paresis of one arm. The affected arm showed markedly less disease involvement, implicating mechanical or growth factors in its etiology. Our data suggest that the natural history of Camurati-Engelmann disease can be benign, and that disease activity commonly attenuates in adulthood. Severe cases of childhood onset and/or with cranial nerve involvement, may occur only in a minority of mutation carriers. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

There are cancer patients with repeat asymptomatic recovery of candida in the urine in whom the choice of treatment, if any, is still a matter of debate. The aim of the study is to test the efficacy and tolerability of a natural anti-fungal phytocompound in patients with tumors of the gastrointestinal tract with prior or ongoing candiduria. Thirty-nine patients with operated gastrointestinal malignancies (18 still under current chemotherapy) with a history of repeated candiduria were enrolled. Eleven patients showed candiduria on enrolment and were treated with K-712, a natural antifungal phytocompound. Genomic analysis was carried out on blood samples of all patients on a monthly basis for 6 months. Within 3 weeks all 11 treated patients had negative cultures in the urine (10 patients after 2 weeks), 7 patients remained free of candiduria throughout the study period while 4 required a new treatment course. Three patients had positive genomic tests for systemic candidiasis and were treated with fluconazole. Eighteen (64 percent) out of the 28 patients who were free of candiduria on enrolment, developed a urinary candida infection during the 6-month follow-up and all cases were successfully treated with K-712. Seven (38 percent) of these cases presented a further recurrence at a later stage and all responded to a new course of K-172. No positive genomic tests were observed during the follow-up period. These data suggest that a consistent part of patients, mostly with gastrointestinal malignancies develop urinary candida infection when following chemotherapy treatment. A therapeutic approach with a natural antifungal phytocompound seems a safe and effective measure and a tentative prophylactic approach might also be envisaged.",

DESIGN:Retrospective chart review of all neonatal intensive care unit patients with systemic candidiasis and sonographic evidence of renal mycetoma admitted to the Duke University Medical Center between January 1, 1993, and July 1, 1998. RESULTS:Fourteen patients were reviewed. Three died from fungemia, and 3 died from other causes months after completing treatment. Ten patients had urine cultures obtained within 1 week of diagnosis; each had a positive routine or fungal urine culture for candida. The rate of improvement of renal mycetoma by ultrasound was variable, ranging from 10 days to 4 months and was not predictive of survival or long-term renal function. All patients who were discharged from the hospital had creatinine </=0.5 mg/dL on discharge. Only 1 patient had surgical intervention (nephrostomy tube placement). Of the 11 patients who survived fungemia, 7 were treated for 3 weeks from the time negative cultures were obtained, while 4 were treated for 5 weeks or more after negative cultures. A declining platelet count was suggestive of fungemia in the patients we reviewed. CONCLUSIONS:For our patients with renal mycetoma without complete obstruction (patients continued to have urine output) surgical intervention was rarely necessary, the rate of sonographic improvement neither correlated with clinical course nor necessitated longer therapy, and long-term creatinine levels were normal. Sustained declines in platelet count of 10% per day or more in a neonate on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis may be indicative of fungemia.",

This study was conducted to better describe the clinical characteristics, natural history, and long-term outcome of monoclonal gammopathy-associated systemic capillary-leak syndrome. METHODS:We conducted a cohort analysis of all patients included in the European Clarkson disease (EurêClark) registry between January 1997 and March 2016. From diagnosis to last follow-up, studied outcomes (eg, the frequency and severity of attacks, death, and evolution toward multiple myeloma) and the type of preventive treatments administered were monitored every 6 months. RESULTS:Sixty-nine patients (M/F sex ratio 1:1; mean ± SD age at disease onset 52 ± 12 years) were included in the study. All patients had monoclonal gammopathy of immunoglobulin G type, with kappa light chains in 47 (68%). Median (interquartile range) follow-up duration was 5.1 (2.5-9.7) years. Twenty-four patients (35%) died after 3.3 (0.9-8) years. Fifty-seven (86%) patients received at least one preventive treatment, including intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) n = 48 (73.8%), theophylline n = 22 (33.8%), terbutaline n = 22 (33.8%), and thalidomide n = 5 (7.7%). In the 65 patients with follow-up, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 78% (n = 35) and 69% (n = 17), respectively. Multivariate analysis found preventive treatment with IVIg (hazard ratio 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.70; P = .007) and terbutaline (hazard ratio 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.96; P = .041) to be independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS:We describe the largest cohort to date of patients with well-defined monoclonal gammopathy-associated systemic capillary-leak syndrome. Preventive treatment with IVIg was the strongest factor associated with survival, suggesting the use of IVIg as the first line in prevention therapy.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of patients diagnosed as having SCLS from November 1, 1981, through April 30, 2008, were reviewed. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze patient demographics, clinical features, complications, and therapeutic interventions. RESULTS: Of the 34 patients whose records were reviewed, 25 fulfilled all diagnostic criteria for SCLS. The median age at diagnosis of SCLS was 44 years. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 4.9 years, and median time to diagnosis from symptom onset was 1.1 years (interquartile range, 0.5-4.1 years). Flulike illness or myalgia was reported by 14 patients (56%) at onset of an acute attack of SCLS, and rhabdomyolysis developed in 9 patients (36%). Patients with a greater decrease in albumin level had a higher likelihood of developing rhabdomyolysis (p=.03). Monoclonal gammopathy, predominantly of the IgG-κ type, was found in 19 patients (76%). The progression rate to multiple myeloma was 0.7% per person-year of follow-up. The overall response rate to the different therapies was 76%, and 24% of patients sustained durable (>2 years) complete remission. The estimated 5-year overall survival rate was 76% (95% confidence interval, 59%-97%). CONCLUSION: Systemic capillary leak syndrome, a rare disease that occurs in those of middle age, is usually diagnosed after a considerable delay from onset of symptoms. The degree of albumin decrement during an attack correlates with development of rhabdomyolysis. A reduction in the frequency and/or the severity of attacks was seen in nearly three-fourths of patients who were offered empirical therapies. The rate of progression to multiple myeloma appears to be comparable to that of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.",

We describe a 39-year-old man with anasarca, bilateral pleural and pericardial effusions, ascites and diffuse alveolo-intersticial edema. Clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with an acute episode of CLS. Treatment with prednisone, furosemide and aminophylline was started, which lead to a gradual improvement in 48 hours. Pathophysiologically there is an increase in capillary permeability with the extravasation of fluid and plasmatic proteins to the extravascular space that can lead to hypovolaemic shock. In the second phase there is a reentry of the fluid overload leading to pulmonary edema. The etiology of this hyperpermeability still remains unclear. The role of cytokines has become central in the comprehension of pathophysiology of CLS. Adhesion molecules are probably also involved in the genesis of capillary leakage. CLS treatment remains empirical. However, at present it seems that the association of steroids with furosemide, aminophylline and terbutaline are capable of controlling the clinical manifestation of the acute episodes in most cases. To our knowledge no prophylatic therapy has clearly proven its efficacy. There are only a few series analyzing the long-term evolution of patients with CLS.

This section is followed by an experimental section in which we reproduce the immediate and delayed responses based on hypothetical mechanisms. In the descriptive section, we arbitrarily divided all the non-survivor animals on which we had sufficient data into three groups based on duration of survival (i.e., 12 hr or less, immediate, 12 to 30 hr, intermediate, and 30 hr or more, delayed). The natural history and pathophysiology of the 12 hr or less group matched that of capillary leak syndrome with a rapid fall in blood pressure, rise in hematocrit, massive edema, and congestion with leukocyte sequestration in both lung and liver, with only limited adrenal cortical hemorrhage. The 12 to 30 hr group matched the natural history of a consumptive hemorrhagic diatheses with a biophasic blood pressure response, limited change in hematocrit, a severe consumptive coagulopathy, severe adrenal cortical hemorrhage, and a moderate renal cortical tubular necrosis, but limited renal cortical thrombosis. The greater than 30 hr group matched the natural history of a microvascular thrombotic (hemolytic uremic) syndrome with a stable blood pressure, a fall in hematocrit associated with a massive renal cortical thrombosis with a severe medullary, and cortical tubular necrosis. We did not analyze these groups further (i.e., type of intervention etc.) once we found that time of survival correlated with a unique clinical syndrome, because based on these observations, we hypothesized that we could reproduce the immediate capillary leak and pulmonary failure, and the delayed microvascular thrombosis and renal failure syndromes experimentally. We reproduced the immediate (< 12 hr) and delayed (> 30 hr) responses by infusion of either tumor necrosis factor or C4b binding protein with sublethal E. coli.

In conclusion, some characteristics can be used as hints for suspecting a RASopathy during the first months of life, and individual RASopathies may be suspected by analysis of specific clinical signs. In the first year of life, these include congenital heart defects, severity of feeding difficulties and delay of developmental milestones, hair and skin anomalies, which may help to distinguish different entities, for their subsequent molecular confirmation and appropriate clinical management.",

Bats have provided the most diverse assemblages of coronaviruses, suggesting that they may be the natural reservoir. Continued virological surveillance has proven to be the best way to avert this infectious disease at the source. Here we provide the first description of a previously unidentified coronavirus lineage detected from wild Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) during virological surveillance in southern China. Partial genome analysis revealed a typical coronavirus genome but with a unique putative accessory gene organization. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, of these novel coronaviruses were most closely related to those of group 3 coronaviruses identified from birds, while the spike protein gene was most closely related to that of group 1 coronaviruses from mammals. However, these viruses always fell into an outgroup phylogenetic relationship with respect to other coronaviruses and had low amino acid similarity to all known coronavirus groups, indicating that they diverged early in the evolutionary history of coronaviruses. These results suggest that these viruses may represent a previously unrecognized evolutionary pathway, or possibly an unidentified coronavirus group.

The disease caused by the flagellate protozoon parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is transmitted to humans by a blood sucking triatomine and much less frequently by blood transfusion. It is estimated that 18 million are infected and that about 100 million people from Latin America are at risk of contracting T. cruzi infection. One of the most important contributions to the knowledge of Chagas' disease has been the recognition of the natural history of the disease, which can be divided into three well defined periods: 1. The acute stage; 2. An undetermined or undifferentiated stage and 3. The chronic stage. The primary infection (first stage) occurs mostly unrecognized and clinically apparent acute chagasic myocarditis may appear in less than 5% of the infected individuals, usually children living in endemic areas. The majority of the cases of acute myocarditis are mild and reversible. Autopsied cases of acute chagasic myocarditis are uncommon and correspond to exceptionally severe or fulminant forms showing diffuse myocardial damage with myocytolisis, degenerative changes of myocardial fibers and marked intersticial cellular infiltration. The acute clinical manifestations of the infected individuals include fever, muscular pain, sweating, swollen lymph nodes, hepatospienomegaly. Following this initial stage, all patients enter the undifferentiated or undetermined stage of the chronic period (second stage), which lasts between 10 to 20 years. Of these, 20 to 30% (depending on marked geographical differences) develop symptoms or signs of visceral damage conforming the cohort that enter the third stage. Although megaesophagous and megacolon are not uncommon (mainly in Brazil), the most frequent and important clinical manifestation is a dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, 70% or more of the infected individuals will never show any clinical manifestation of the disease. The ajmaline test and the endomyocardial biopsy are, probably, the most sensitive methods to unmask latent forms of chagasic myocarditis during the undifferentiated stage. In the most advanced stages of chronic chagasic myocarditis, pathological findings are those of a dilated cardiomyopathy. At autopsy, the apical aneurysm with thrombus in it is a frequent and distinctive finding. The histopathological picture is that of an active and chronic microfocal and disseminated myocarditis. In some cases fibrosis may be confluent, which accounts for the electrocardiographic patterns of myocardial necrosis. The widespread distribution of cardiac lesions also constitute the substrate for atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction disturbances and for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. The clinical diagnosis of Chagas' heart disease is based on a triad of: positive epidemiology, positive serology and a combination of clinical findings (suggestive electrocardiograhic abnormalities, apical aneurysm, cardiac enlargement). The electrocardiogram in the most advanced forms, usually shows sinus bradycardia, right bundle branch block with or without left anterior hemiblock, primary T wave abnormalities, pathological Q waves and multiform ventricular premature beats. The pathogenesis of the myocardial lesions of acute and also chronic chagasic myocarditis appears to be related in large part to autoimmune mechanisms. The lack of correlation between the location and number of parasitized fibers and the severity, type, and extension of degenerative and inflammatory lesions supports this assumption. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the presence of antibodies directed against different components of T. cruzi and crossreacting with human antigens in patients with chronic chagasic myocarditis. Microvascular dysfunction, myocardial ischemia and autonomic nervous system impairment have also been implica",

PROCEDURE: Prevalence and predictors of cardiotoxicity were retrospectively reviewed in 124 children treated on the MRC AML 10 and AML 12 trials in a single, large centre from November 1987 to September 2004. Subclinical cardiotoxicity was defined as a shortening fraction of less than 28% and clinical cardiomyopathy as evidence of heart failure, and both were classified as late cardiotoxicity 1 year after completing first line therapy. RESULTS: Cumulative survival was 61% at 10 years. The prevalence of early and late cardiotoxicity was 13.7% (95%-CI: 8.2-22.0%) and 17.4% (95%-CI: 10.9-26.8%), respectively. Early cardiotoxicity was a strong predictor (OR = 9.18; 95%-CI: 2.10-40.11; P < 0.005) and children who received salvage therapy following relapse showed a trend towards increased late cardiotoxicity (OR = 3.53; 95%-CI: 0.86-14.48; P < 0.08).

METHODS: We included in the study 201 consecutive patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <or=45% due to AC-CMP. Enalapril and, when possible, carvedilol were promptly initiated after detection of LVEF impairment. LVEF was measured at enrollment, every month for the first 3 months, every 3 months during the first 2 following years, and every 6 months afterward (mean follow-up 36 +/- 27 months). Patients were considered responders, partial responders, or nonresponders according to complete, partial, or no recovery in LVEF, respectively. Major adverse cardiac events during follow-up were also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (42%) were responders; 26 patients (13%) were partial responders, and 90 patients (45%) were nonresponders. The percentage of responders progressively decreased as the time from the end of chemotherapy to the start of HF treatment increased; no complete recovery of LVEF was observed after 6 months.

These cases can have different evolutions and responses to treatment. Nevertheless, the evidence available is limited, and it is necessary to evaluate whether they represent a differential phenotype and provide recommendations about diagnosis and treatment, in addition to identifying possible gaps in our understanding of asthma and COPD. METHODS: A nation-wide consensus of experts in COPD in two stages: 1) during an initial meeting, the topics to be dealt with were established and a first draft of statements was elaborated with a structured ""brainstorming"" method; 2) consensus was reached with two rounds of e-mails, using a Likert-type scale. RESULTS: Consensus was reached about the existence of a differential clinical phenotype known as""Overlap Phenotype COPD-Asthma"", whose diagnosis is made when 2 major criteria and 2 minor criteria are met. The major criteria include very positive bronchodilator test (increase in FEV(1) ≥ 15% and ≥ 400ml), eosinophilia in sputum and personal history of asthma. Minor criteria include high total IgE, personal history of atopy and positive bronchodilator test (increase in FEV(1) ≥ 12% and ≥ 200ml) on two or more occasions. The early use of individually-adjusted inhaled corticosteroids is recommended, and caution must be taken with their abrupt withdrawal. Meanwhile, in severe cases the use of triple therapy should be evaluated. Finally, there is an obvious lack of specific studies about the natural history and the treatment of these patients.

However, recognition is not straightforward because it requires assessment of airway inflammation. Secondly, the natural history of eosinophilic bronchitis is uncertain.

We sought to identify the prevalence and characteristics of oculomotor abnormalities at first presentation in a large SCA cohort, including those in earlier stages of disease. We performed a retrospective assessment of initial clinical examinations of SCA patients followed in the Massachusetts General Hospital Ataxia Unit and assessed with the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS). One hundred thirty-four SCA patients were assessed: 17 SCA1, 13 SCA2, 55 SCA3, 2 SCA5, 22 SCA6, 11 SCA7, 9 SCA8, and 5 SCA17, mainly in the early stages of disease (67.2% stage 0-1). Oculomotor abnormalities were present on initial assessment in 94.8%, including 7/9 stage 0 and 77/81 stage 1 patients. Stage 0/1 patients had frequent saccadic intrusions, nystagmus, and hypo/hypermetric saccades. Saccadic slowing was present even in early stage SCA7 and SCA2, eventually leading to ophthalmoplegia. The burden of oculomotor abnormalities correlated with disease stage, duration, and severity, remaining highly significant even when controlling for age. The ubiquitous presence of oculomotor abnormalities in the SCAs, particularly early in the course, underscores the importance of oculomotor assessment in ataxia rating scales such as BARS. These findings highlight the potential for quantitative physiological oculomotor measures as clinical biomarkers in natural history studies and clinical trials.",

Our aims are to describe the clinical and neuroradiological features in children with NF1 and cerebellar FASI, and report on the natural history of FASI that display atypical features such as enhancement and mass effect. Method:A retrospective review of the hospital charts and brain MRIs was performed on children from Manitoba diagnosed between 1999 and 2008 with NF1, who also had cerebellar FASI on MRI. Results:Fifty patients (mean age: 16.1y, minimum-maximum: 6.4 - 30y, 27 M) were identified. Mean duration of follow up was 10.1y. Developmental delay, learning disabilities, tumors, and visual signs occurred commonly. Cerebellar signs were not reported. Mean age of the patients at baseline MRI was 7.8 (SD: 4.5) years. FASI occurred in several brain locations and were rarely confined to the cerebellum. FASI displayed mass effect and enhancement infrequently but were associated with malignancy only once. The number of FASI at baseline MRI was significantly less in patients with attention deficient hyperactivity disorder and more if a first degree relative had NF1 or if they had decreased visual acuity. Discussion:Patients with NF1 and cerebellar FASI do not have motor or consistent non-motor (e.g. developmental delay or learning disabilities) cerebellar features. The number of FASI may correlate with some clinical features. FASI may display enhancement and mass effect but they rarely become malignant.",

It is due to an alteration in tubulin and it is determined by mutations in heterocygosis in TUBB4A gene, showing complete penetrance. CASE REPORT:An 8-year-old child with history of delayed motor development, tremor, dysathria, ataxia, nystagmus, cognitive deficit and dystonia with pattern of hypomielination, vermis hypoplasia and absence of putamen. These findings, although distinctive, had been underestimated in previous evaluations and their detection determined the analyse and identification of a pathogenic variant in TUBB4A gene.

In more severe cases, immune deficiency and recurring infections can add to disease severity. RTEL1 deficiency has recently been described as a major genetic etiology, but the molecular basis and clinical consequences of RTEL1-associated DC are incompletely characterized. We report our observations in a cohort of six patients: five with novel biallelic RTEL1 mutations p.Trp456Cys, p.Ile425Thr, p.Cys1244ProfsX17, p.Pro884_Gln885ins53X13, and one with novel heterozygous mutation p.Val796AlafsX4. The most unifying features were hypocellular BMF in 6/6 and B-/NK-cell lymphopenia in 5/6 patients. In addition, three patients with homozygous mutations p.Trp456Cys or p.Ile425Thr also suffered from immunodeficiency, cerebellar hypoplasia, and enteropathy, consistent with Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome. Chromosomal breakage resembling a homologous recombination defect was detected in patient-derived fibroblasts but not in hematopoietic compartment. Notably, in both cellular compartments, differential expression of 1243aa and 1219/1300aa RTEL1 isoforms was observed. In fibroblasts, response to ionizing irradiation and non-homologous end joining were not impaired. Telomeric circles did not accumulate in patient-derived primary cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines, implying alternative pathomechanisms for telomeric loss. Overall, RTEL1-deficient cells exhibited a phenotype of replicative exhaustion, spontaneous apoptosis and senescence. Specifically, CD34+ cells failed to expand in vitro, B-cell development was compromised, and T-cells did not proliferate in long-term culture. Finally, we report on the natural history and outcome of our patients. While two patients died from infections, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) resulted in sustained engraftment in two patients. Whether chemotherapy negatively impacts on the course and onset of other DC-related symptoms remains open at present. Early-onset lung disease occurred in one of our patients after HSCT. In conclusion, RTEL deficiency can show a heterogeneous clinical picture ranging from mild hypocellular BMF with B/NK cell lymphopenia to early-onset, very severe, and rapidly progressing cellular deficiency.",

Reports were reviewed when MRI was not available. MRIs were categorized as follows: (1) cortical, brainstem, and cerebellar malformations; (2) cortical and cerebellar malformations; or (3) normal. Language development was assigned to 1 of 3 categories by a speech pathologist. Maximal motor function and presence of epilepsy were determined by history or examination.Twenty-five MRIs and 9 reports were reviewed. The most common MRI abnormalities were cobblestone cortex or dysgyria with an anterior-posterior gradient and cerebellar hypoplasia. Seven individuals had MRIs in group 1, 8 in group 2, and 19 in group 3. Language was impaired in 100% of those in MRI groups 1 and 2, and degree of language impairment correlated with severity of imaging.

However, the phenotypic spectrum in males has not been systematically evaluated to date.We identified a CASK alteration in 8 novel unrelated male patients by targeted Sanger sequencing, copy number analysis (MLPA and/or FISH) and array CGH. CASK transcripts were investigated by RT-PCR followed by sequencing. Immunoblotting was used to detect CASK protein in patient-derived cells. The clinical phenotype and natural history of the 8 patients and 28 CASK-mutation positive males reported previously were reviewed and correlated with available molecular data.CASK alterations include one nonsense mutation, one 5-bp deletion, one mutation of the start codon, and five partial gene deletions and duplications; seven were de novo, including three somatic mosaicisms, and one was familial. In three subjects, specific mRNA junction fragments indicated in tandem duplication of CASK exons disrupting the integrity of the gene. The 5-bp deletion resulted in multiple aberrant CASK mRNAs. In fibroblasts from patients with a CASK loss-of-function mutation, no CASK protein could be detected. Individuals who are mosaic for a severe CASK mutation or carry a hypomorphic mutation still showed detectable amount of protein.Based on eight novel patients and all CASK-mutation positive males reported previously three phenotypic groups can be distinguished that represent a clinical continuum: (i) MICPCH with severe epileptic encephalopathy caused by hemizygous loss-of-function mutations, (ii) MICPCH associated with inactivating alterations in the mosaic state or a partly penetrant mutation, and (iii) syndromic/nonsyndromic mild to severe ID with or without nystagmus caused by CASK missense and splice mutations that leave the CASK protein intact but likely alter its function or reduce the amount of normal protein.

The birth prevalence of this disorder is approximately 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 8,000, and the life span of the majority of patients is less than 1 year. As information regarding outcome in trisomy 18 is rather fragmentary in the literature, this study is aimed at investigating the survival and natural history of trisomy 18. We also evaluated the survival age and management of trisomy 18 in two different periods, before and after the implementation of National Health Insurance (NHI) program. Thirty-nine cases of trisomy 18 were collected in Mackay Memorial Hospital in a 17-year period, from 1988 to 2004. Delivery data, survival age, management before and after the implementation of NHI program, structural defects, image findings and cytogenetic results were analyzed by medical and nurse's records. The diagnosis of trisomy 18 was based on the prenatal amniocentesis or postnatal chromosome analysis. Three patients had trisomy 18 mosaicism. Since cardiovascular and central nervous systems are the most common organ systems involved in this disorder, 31 patients received brain ultrasonography and heart ultrasonography for evaluation of their multiple anomalies after admission. All patients except one died in their first year due to severe malformations of the cardiovascular or central nervous systems. The median survival age was 6 days. We found a longer survival with female patients than with male patients (P < 0.05). Implementation of NHI program in the more recent decade of this study period was associated with longer survival of trisomy 18 (P < 0.05). The three most common structural defects were clenched hands (95%), rocker bottom feet (90%), and low set or malformed ears (90%). Low birth weight was present in 90%. By cardiac ultrasonography, the top four heart defects were ventricular septal defect (94%), patent ductus arteriosus (77%) and atrial septal defect (68%). However, ten cases (32%) had complex congenital heart defects. By brain ultrasonography, the most common brain lesion was cerebellar hypoplasia (32%), followed by brain edema (29%), enlarged cisterna magna (26%) and choroid plexus cysts (19%). Although most patients with trisomy 18 die within the first few weeks after birth, it is important to recognize that a small but notable percentage of these patients will survive the first year. When prenatal or postnatal decisions need to be made, the possibility of long-term survival should be included in any discussion to enable families to make the most appropriate decision.",

The conduct of large-scale community-based cohort studies is challenging with reference to money, manpower and time. Further, attrition inherent to cohort studies can affect the power, and thereby the study's validity. Our objective was to estimate the percentage of participant withdrawal and to subsequently understand reasons for the same in the Vellore Typhoid Surveillance (VTS) cohort. METHODS:VTS study, a prospective community-based pediatric cohort, was established in a semi-urban settlement of Vellore to estimate the incidence rate of typhoid fever. An active weekly surveillance identified children with fever, and blood cultures were performed for fevers of ≥3 days. Reasons for participant drop-out in the cohort were documented. Nine focus group discussions (FGD), each with 5 to 7 parents/primary caregivers of former as well current participants were conducted separately, to understand reasons for consent withdrawal as well as the good aspects of the study that the current participants perceived. A descriptive, as well as an interpretative account of the themes that emerged from the FGDs were done. RESULTS:Of the 5639 children in the VTS cohort, 404 (7.2%) withdrew consent during the 12-month surveillance. Of these, 50% dropped out due to migration from study area; 18.1% as their parents were unhappy with the blood draws for blood culture; and 14.4% did not clearly put forth the reason for consent withdrawal. Being from an orthodox background, high socio-economic status and joint family were associated with a decision to drop-out. Frequent and voluminous blood draws, male field research assistants (FRA) making weekly home-visits, the perception that inquiring about fever made their child fall sick, and that the study clinic did not initiate antibiotics immediately, were the important themes that emerged from the FGDs conducted among drop-outs. CONCLUSION:Our study showed that specific beliefs and behaviours within the community influenced the drop-out rate of the VTS cohort. Background characteristics and perceptions that exist, along with attrition data from previous cohort studies in the specific community are important to be considered while implementing large-scale cohort studies.",

Further genetic studies revealed homozygous mutations in TRAP1, encoding the mitochondrial/ER resident chaperone protein tumour necrosis factor receptor associated protein 1 (TRAP1). Identification of a fourth, unrelated patient with autoinflammation and compound heterozygous mutation of TRAP1 alone facilitated further functional studies, confirming the importance of this protein as a chaperone of misfolded proteins with loss of function, which may contribute to autoinflammation.

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions.",

We aimed to describe the typical evolution of a sporadic, hemorrhagic brain cavernous malformation with time. MATERIALS AND METHODS:From our institutional review board-approved cavernous malformation registry, we assessed initial clinical and radiologic features and the subsequent MR imaging evolution of 51 patients with sporadic, hemorrhagic brain cavernous malformations (with follow-up brain MRIs available for review). RESULTS:The initial MR imaging demonstrated mostly Zabramski type I lesions (94.2%) with T1 hyperintensity (94.2%) and associated edema (76.5%). Eight patients (15.6%) rebled in the first year with lesions characterized by new T1 hyperintensity (100%), edema (61.5%), and growth (median, 4 mm). By 90 days, most lesions had changed from Zabramski type I to type II or III (65.2%). While 76.5% had edema associated with the acute hemorrhage, none had persistent edema beyond 90 days unless rebleeding occurred. Across time, the frequency of T1 hyperintensity decreased from 94.2% at baseline to 73.9%, 57.1%, and 50.0% at <90, 91-365, and >365 days.

The disease results from mutations in the TPP1 (CLN2) gene. Studies were undertaken to characterize the effects of a TPP1 frameshift mutation on the retina in Dachshunds. METHODS: A litter of four puppies consisting of one homozygous affected dog, two heterozygotes, and one homozygous normal dog were monitored for neurologic and retinal changes through 10 months of age. The affected and homozygous normal dogs, as well as one of the heterozygotes, were then euthanatized, and the retinas were examined morphologically. RESULTS: The affected dog exhibited normal visual behavior and retinal function at 3 months of age, but vision was clearly impaired by 7 months, with markedly reduced ERG b-wave amplitudes. Beyond 7 months of age, the affected dog was functionally blind, and pupillary light reflexes and ERG response amplitudes continued to decline through 10 months of age. Both rod and cone system functions were severely impaired. The retina exhibited accumulation of autofluorescent storage bodies with distinctive curvilinear contents. Substantial cell loss occurred in the inner nuclear layer, with a smaller reduction in photoreceptor cell density. CONCLUSIONS: The canine TPP1 mutation results in progressive vision loss and retinal degeneration similar to that which occurs in human late infantile NCL. With the canine model, the natural history of disease progression in the retina provides a better understanding of the pathologic course of the disease and provides objective markers that can be used to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.",

As a group, LSDs affect ~1 in 5000 live births; however, each individual storage disease is rare, limiting the ability to perform natural history studies or to perform clinical trials. Perhaps in no other biomedical field have naturally occurring large animal (canine, feline, ovine, caprine, and bovine) models been so essential for understanding the fundamentals of disease pathogenesis and for developing safe and effective therapies. These models were critical for the development of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in α- and β- mannosidosis, fucosidosis, and the mucopolysaccharidoses; enzyme replacement therapy for fucosidosis, the mucopolysaccharidoses, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; and small molecule therapy in Niemann-Pick type C disease. However, their most notable contributions to the biomedical field are in the development of gene therapy for LSDs. Adeno-associated viral vectors to treat nervous system disease have been evaluated in the large animal models of α-mannosidosis, globoid cell leukodystrophy, GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis, the mucopolysaccharidoses, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

We aimed to analyse the characteristics and rate of progression of CLN2 disease in an international cohort of patients. METHODS:We did an observational cohort study using data from two independent, international datasets of patients with untreated genotypically confirmed CLN2 disease: the DEM-CHILD dataset (n=74) and the Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) dataset (n=66). Both datasets included quantitative rating assessments with disease-specific clinical domain scores, and disease course was measured longitudinally in 67 patients in the DEM-CHILD cohort. We analysed these data to determine age of disease onset and diagnosis, as well as disease progression-measured by the rate of decline in motor and language summary scores (on a scale of 0-6 points)-and time from first symptom to death. FINDINGS:In the combined DEM-CHILD and WCMC dataset, median age was 35·0 months (IQR 24·0-38·5) at first clinical symptom, 37·0 months (IQR 35·0 -42·0) at first seizure, and 54·0 months (IQR 47·5-60·0) at diagnosis. Of 74 patients in the DEM-CHILD dataset, the most common first symptoms of disease were seizures (52 [70%]), language difficulty (42 [57%]), motor difficulty (30 [41%]), behavioural abnormality (12 [16%]), and dementia (seven [9%]). Among the 41 patients in the DEM-CHILD dataset for whom longitudinal assessments spanning the entire disease course were available, a rapid annual decline of 1·81 score units (95% CI 1·50-2·12) was seen in motor-language summary scores from normal (score of 6) to no function (score of 0), which occurred over approximately 30 months. Among 53 patients in the DEM-CHILD cohort with available data, the median time between onset of first disease symptom and death was 7·8 years (SE 0·9) years. INTERPRETATION:In view of its natural history, late-infantile CLN2 disease should be considered in young children with delayed language acquisition and new onset of seizures.

We have previously reported that phosphocysteamine and N-acetylcysteine mediate ceroid depletion in cultured cells from patients with this disease. We aimed to assess whether combination of oral cysteamine bitartrate and N-acetylcysteine is beneficial for patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. METHODS:Children between 6 months and 3 years of age with infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis with any two of the seven most lethal PPT1 mutations were eligible for inclusion in this pilot study. All patients were recruited from physician referrals. Patients received oral cysteamine bitartrate (60 mg/kg per day) and N-acetylcysteine (60 mg/kg per day) and were assessed every 6-12 months until they had an isoelectric electroencephalogram (EEG, attesting to a vegetative state) or were too ill to travel. Patients were also assessed by electroretinography, brain MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and electron microscopic analyses of leukocytes for granular osmiophilic deposits (GRODs). Children also underwent physical and neurodevelopmental assessments on the Denver scale. Outcomes were compared with the reported natural history of infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and that of affected older siblings. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00028262. FINDINGS:Between March 14, 2001, and June 30, 2012, we recruited ten children with infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; one child was lost to follow-up after the first visit and nine patients (five girls and four boys) were followed up for 8 to 75 months. MRI showed abnormalities similar to those in previous reports; brain volume and N-acetyl aspartic acid (NAA) decreased steadily, but no published quantitative MRI or MRS studies were available for comparison. None of the children acquired new developmental skills, and their retinal function decreased progressively. Average time to isoelectric EEG (52 months, SD 13) was longer than reported previously (36 months). At the first follow-up visit, peripheral leukocytes in all nine patients showed virtually complete depletion of GRODs. Parents and physicians reported less irritability, improved alertness, or both in seven patients. No treatment-related adverse events occurred apart from mild gastrointestinal discomfort in two patients, which disappeared when liquid cysteamine bitartrate was replaced with capsules. INTERPRETATION:Our findings suggest that combination therapy with cysteamine bitartrate and N-acetylcysteine is associated with delay of isoelectric EEG, depletion of GRODs, and subjective benefits as reported by parents and physicians. Our systematic and quantitative report of the natural history of patients with infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis provides a guide for future assessment of experimental therapies.

We aimed to analyse the characteristics and rate of progression of CLN2 disease in an international cohort of patients. METHODS:We did an observational cohort study using data from two independent, international datasets of patients with untreated genotypically confirmed CLN2 disease: the DEM-CHILD dataset (n=74) and the Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) dataset (n=66). Both datasets included quantitative rating assessments with disease-specific clinical domain scores, and disease course was measured longitudinally in 67 patients in the DEM-CHILD cohort. We analysed these data to determine age of disease onset and diagnosis, as well as disease progression-measured by the rate of decline in motor and language summary scores (on a scale of 0-6 points)-and time from first symptom to death. FINDINGS:In the combined DEM-CHILD and WCMC dataset, median age was 35·0 months (IQR 24·0-38·5) at first clinical symptom, 37·0 months (IQR 35·0 -42·0) at first seizure, and 54·0 months (IQR 47·5-60·0) at diagnosis. Of 74 patients in the DEM-CHILD dataset, the most common first symptoms of disease were seizures (52 [70%]), language difficulty (42 [57%]), motor difficulty (30 [41%]), behavioural abnormality (12 [16%]), and dementia (seven [9%]). Among the 41 patients in the DEM-CHILD dataset for whom longitudinal assessments spanning the entire disease course were available, a rapid annual decline of 1·81 score units (95% CI 1·50-2·12) was seen in motor-language summary scores from normal (score of 6) to no function (score of 0), which occurred over approximately 30 months. Among 53 patients in the DEM-CHILD cohort with available data, the median time between onset of first disease symptom and death was 7·8 years (SE 0·9) years. INTERPRETATION:In view of its natural history, late-infantile CLN2 disease should be considered in young children with delayed language acquisition and new onset of seizures. CLN2 disease has a largely predictable time course with regard to the loss of language and motor function, and these data might serve as historical controls for the assessment of current and future therapies.

Onset of visual failure around 6 years of age is thought to precede cognitive deterioration by a few years, but casuistic reports question this paradigm. The aim of our study is to delineate timing of cognitive decline in CLN3 disease. METHODS:Early neurocognitive functioning in CLN3 disease was analyzed using age at onset of visual and cognitive decline and IQ scores from literature-derived patient descriptions, supplemented with IQ scores and school history from a retrospective referral center cohort. We analyzed protracted and classical CLN3 separately and added a control group of patients diagnosed with juvenile onset macular degeneration (early onset Stargardt disease) to control for possible effects of rapid vision loss on neurocognitive functioning. RESULTS:Onset of cognitive decline at a mean age of 6.8 years (range 2-13 years, n = 19) paralleled onset of visual deterioration at a mean age of 6.4 years (range 4-9 years, n = 81) as supported by an early decline in IQ scores in classical CLN3 disease. Onset and course of vision loss was similar in patients with protracted CLN3. The decreased IQ levels at diagnosis (mean 68.4, range 57-79, n = 9) in the referral cohort were consistently associated with an aberrant early school history contrasting normal school history and cognition in Stargardt disease patients.

We have previously reported that phosphocysteamine and N-acetylcysteine mediate ceroid depletion in cultured cells from patients with this disease. We aimed to assess whether combination of oral cysteamine bitartrate and N-acetylcysteine is beneficial for patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. METHODS:Children between 6 months and 3 years of age with infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis with any two of the seven most lethal PPT1 mutations were eligible for inclusion in this pilot study. All patients were recruited from physician referrals. Patients received oral cysteamine bitartrate (60 mg/kg per day) and N-acetylcysteine (60 mg/kg per day) and were assessed every 6-12 months until they had an isoelectric electroencephalogram (EEG, attesting to a vegetative state) or were too ill to travel. Patients were also assessed by electroretinography, brain MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and electron microscopic analyses of leukocytes for granular osmiophilic deposits (GRODs). Children also underwent physical and neurodevelopmental assessments on the Denver scale. Outcomes were compared with the reported natural history of infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and that of affected older siblings. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00028262. FINDINGS:Between March 14, 2001, and June 30, 2012, we recruited ten children with infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; one child was lost to follow-up after the first visit and nine patients (five girls and four boys) were followed up for 8 to 75 months. MRI showed abnormalities similar to those in previous reports; brain volume and N-acetyl aspartic acid (NAA) decreased steadily, but no published quantitative MRI or MRS studies were available for comparison. None of the children acquired new developmental skills, and their retinal function decreased progressively. Average time to isoelectric EEG (52 months, SD 13) was longer than reported previously (36 months). At the first follow-up visit, peripheral leukocytes in all nine patients showed virtually complete depletion of GRODs. Parents and physicians reported less irritability, improved alertness, or both in seven patients. No treatment-related adverse events occurred apart from mild gastrointestinal discomfort in two patients, which disappeared when liquid cysteamine bitartrate was replaced with capsules. INTERPRETATION:Our findings suggest that combination therapy with cysteamine bitartrate and N-acetylcysteine is associated with delay of isoelectric EEG, depletion of GRODs, and subjective benefits as reported by parents and physicians. Our systematic and quantitative report of the natural history of patients with infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis provides a guide for future assessment of experimental therapies.

Mutations in the CLN1 gene may be associated with a variant form of JNCL (vJNCL). We report the clinical course and molecular studies in 24 patients with JNCL collected from 1975 to 2010 with the aim of assessing the natural history of the disorder and phenotype/genotype correlations. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Patients were classified into the groups of vJNCL with mutations in the CLN1 gene and/or granular osmiophilic deposit (GROD) inclusion bodies (n = 11) and classic JNCL (cJNCL) with mutations in the CLN3 gene and/or fingerprint (FP) profiles (n = 13). Psychomotor impairment included regression of acquired skills, cognitive decline, and clinical manifestations of the disease. We used Kaplan-Meier analyses to estimate the age of onset of psychomotor impairment. RESULTS:Patients with vJNCL showed learning delay at an earlier age (median 4 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1-4.8) than those in the cJNCL group (median 8 years, 95% CI 6.2-9.7) (P = 0.001) and regression of acquired skills at a younger age. Patients with vJNCL showed a more severe and progressive clinical course than those with cJNCL. There may be a Gypsy ancestry for V181L missense mutation in the CLN1 gene.

785,GARD:0001235,Chaotic atrial tachycardia,20301680,"['Book', 'Review']",Costello Syndrome,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301680,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:While the majority of individuals with Costello syndrome share characteristic findings affecting multiple organ systems, the phenotypic spectrum is wide, ranging from a milder or attenuated phenotype to a severe phenotype with early lethal complications. Costello syndrome is typically characterized by failure to thrive in infancy as a result of severe postnatal feeding difficulties; short stature; developmental delay or intellectual disability; coarse facial features (full lips, large mouth, full nasal tip); curly or sparse, fine hair; loose, soft skin with deep palmar and plantar creases; papillomata of the face and perianal region; diffuse hypotonia and joint laxity with ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers; tight Achilles tendons; and cardiac involvement including: cardiac hypertrophy (usually typical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), congenital heart defect (usually valvar pulmonic stenosis), and arrhythmia (usually supraventricular tachycardia, especially chaotic atrial rhythm/multifocal atrial tachycardia or ectopic atrial tachycardia). Relative or absolute macrocephaly is typical, and postnatal cerebellar overgrowth can result in the development of a Chiari I malformation with associated anomalies including hydrocephalus or syringomyelia. Individuals with Costello syndrome have an approximately 15% lifetime risk for malignant tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma in young children and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in adolescents and young adults. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of Costello syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous HRAS pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Failure to thrive is the most common and challenging clinical problem; most infants require nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding; many require Nissen fundoplication. Treatment of cardiac manifestations and malignancy is routine. Ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers often requires early bracing and occupational and/or physical therapy; tight Achilles tendons may require surgical tendon lengthening. Developmental disability requires early-intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Recurrent facial papillomata may require routine removal with dry ice. Hemodynamically significant valvar stenoses require antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis; anesthesia may pose a risk to those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or those predisposed to some types of atrial tachycardia. Surveillance: Monitoring for neonatal hypoglycemia; echocardiography with electrocardiogram at diagnosis with subsequent follow up by a cardiologist who is aware of the spectrum of cardiac disease and its natural history; abdominal and pelvic ultrasound examinations to screen for rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma every three to six months until age eight to ten years may be considered; annual urinalysis for evidence of hematuria to screen for bladder cancer beginning at age ten years. GENETIC COUNSELING:Costello syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands with Costello syndrome have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; although parents of probands are not affected, vertical transmission has been reported in two families with the rare, attenuated phenotype. Because Costello syndrome is typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of a proband is presumed to be small; however, recurrence in sibs has been reported and is suspected to be the result of germline mosaicism in a parent. Individuals with Costello syndrome typically do not reproduce. Once an HRAS pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

Patients with a history of cardiac surgery or neuromuscular diseases were excluded. An electrophysiologic study was performed in each patient: transesophageal (110 patients) or transvenous (14 patients) or both (13 patients). Mechanisms were classified as SVT using accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection (SVT using accessory connection, including orthodromic and antidromic reciprocating tachycardia), primary atrial tachycardia (including chaotic, automatic and reentrant atrial tachycardia), and tachycardia due to reentry within the AV node. SVT using accessory connection occurred in 100 of 137 patients (73%) and was the most prevalent mechanism. Primary atrial tachycardia and reentry within the AV node were present in 19 of 137 (14%) and 18 of 137 (13%) patients, respectively. Using a multinomial logit model, relative probabilities for tachycardia mechanisms for 5 age groups--prenatal, less than 1, 1 to 5, 6 to 10 and greater than 10 years--were determined. Primary atrial tachycardia (11 to 16%) and SVT using accessory connection (58 to 84%) appeared throughout infancy, childhood and adolescence. On the other hand, tachycardia due to reentry within the AV node (0 to 31%) rarely appeared before age 2 years. Mechanisms of SVT appear to have age-dependent distributions. SVT using accessory connection is the most common mechanism in young patients. We speculate that the propensity to tachycardia due to reentry within the AV node occurs during postnatal development.",

This study investigates the natural history and mechanisms of segmental demyelination in CMT4J. METHODS:Over the past 9 years, we have enrolled and studied a cohort of 12 CMT4J patients, including 6 novel FIG4 mutations. We evaluated these patients and related mouse models using morphological, electrophysiological, and biochemical approaches. RESULTS:We found sensory motor demyelinating polyneuropathy consistently in all patients. This underlying myelin pathology was associated with nonuniform slowing of conduction velocities, conduction block, and temporal dispersion on nerve conduction studies, which resemble those features in acquired demyelinating peripheral nerve diseases. Segmental demyelination was also confirmed in mice without Fig4 (Fig4-/- ). The demyelination was associated with an increase of Schwann cell dedifferentiation and macrophages in spinal roots where nerve-blood barriers are weak. Schwann cell dedifferentiation was induced by the increasing intracellular Ca2+ . Suppression of Ca2+ level by a chelator reduced dedifferentiation and demyelination of Schwann cells in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, cell-specific knockout of Fig4 in mouse Schwann cells or neurons failed to cause segmental demyelination. INTERPRETATION:Myelin change in CMT4J recapitulates the features of acquired demyelinating neuropathies. This pathology is not Schwann cell autonomous. Instead, it relates to systemic processes involving interactions of multiple cell types and abnormally elevated intracellular Ca2+ . Injection of a Ca2+ chelator into Fig4-/- mice improved segmental demyelination, thereby providing a therapeutic strategy against demyelination. Ann Neurol 2018;83:756-770.",

Thus, the term NMDs encompasses a vast array of different syndromes. Some of these syndromes are of direct relevance to paediatric orthopaedic surgeons, either because the presenting manifestation is a functional sign (e.g., toe-walking) or deformity (e.g., pes cavus or scoliosis) suggesting a need for orthopaedic attention or because orthopaedic abnormalities requiring treatment develop during the course of a known NMD. The main NMDs relevant to the orthopaedic surgeon are infantile spinal muscular atrophy (a motor neuron disease), peripheral neuropathies (chiefly, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), congenital muscular dystrophies, progressive muscular dystrophies, and Steinert myotonic dystrophy (or myotonic dystrophy type 1). Muscle weakness is a symptom shared by all these conditions. The paediatric orthopaedic surgeon must be familiar, not only with the musculoskeletal system, but also with many other domains (particularly respiratory and cardiac function and nutrition) that may interfere with the treatment and require preoperative management. Good knowledge of the natural history of each NMD is essential to ensure optimal timing of the therapeutic interventions, which must be performed under the best possible conditions in these usually frail patients. Timing is particularly crucial for the treatment of spinal deformities due to paraspinal muscle hypotonia during growth: depending on the disease and natural history, the treatment may involve non-operative methods or growing rods, followed by spinal fusion. A multidisciplinary approach is always required. Finally, the survival gains achieved in recent years increasingly require attention to preparing for adult life, to orthopaedic problems requiring treatment before the patient leaves the paediatric environment, and to the transition towards the adult healthcare system.",

L-serine supplementation is a possible candidate therapy but the lack of responsive outcome measures is a barrier for undertaking clinical trials in HSN1. We performed a 12-month natural history study to characterise the phenotype of HSN1 and to identify responsive outcome measures. METHODS:Assessments included Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score version 2 (CMTNSv2), CMTNSv2-Rasch modified, nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, intraepidermal nerve fibre density (thigh), computerised myometry (lower limbs), plasma 1-deoxysphingolipid levels, calf-level intramuscular fat accumulation by MRI and patient-based questionnaires (Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory and 36-Short Form Health Survey version 2 [SF-36v2]). RESULTS:35 patients with HSN1 were recruited. There was marked heterogeneity in the phenotype mainly due to differences between the sexes: males generally more severely affected. The outcome measures that significantly changed over 1 year and correlated with CMTNSv2, SF-36v2-physical component and disease duration were MRI determined calf intramuscular fat accumulation (mean change in overall calf fat fraction 2.36%, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.55, p=0.0004), pressure pain threshold on the hand (mean change 40 kPa, 95% CI 0.7 to 80, p=0.046) and myometric measurements of ankle plantar flexion (median change -0.5 Nm, IQR -9.5 to 0, p=0.0007), ankle inversion (mean change -0.89 Nm, 95% CI -1.66 to -0.12, p=0.03) and eversion (mean change -1.61 Nm, 95% CI -2.72 to -0.51, p=0.006). Intramuscular calf fat fraction was the most responsive outcome measure. CONCLUSION:MRI determined calf muscle fat fraction shows validity and high responsiveness over 12 months and will be useful in HSN1 clinical trials.",

This study investigates the natural history and mechanisms of segmental demyelination in CMT4J. METHODS:Over the past 9 years, we have enrolled and studied a cohort of 12 CMT4J patients, including 6 novel FIG4 mutations. We evaluated these patients and related mouse models using morphological, electrophysiological, and biochemical approaches. RESULTS:We found sensory motor demyelinating polyneuropathy consistently in all patients. This underlying myelin pathology was associated with nonuniform slowing of conduction velocities, conduction block, and temporal dispersion on nerve conduction studies, which resemble those features in acquired demyelinating peripheral nerve diseases. Segmental demyelination was also confirmed in mice without Fig4 (Fig4-/- ). The demyelination was associated with an increase of Schwann cell dedifferentiation and macrophages in spinal roots where nerve-blood barriers are weak. Schwann cell dedifferentiation was induced by the increasing intracellular Ca2+ . Suppression of Ca2+ level by a chelator reduced dedifferentiation and demyelination of Schwann cells in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, cell-specific knockout of Fig4 in mouse Schwann cells or neurons failed to cause segmental demyelination. INTERPRETATION:Myelin change in CMT4J recapitulates the features of acquired demyelinating neuropathies. This pathology is not Schwann cell autonomous. Instead, it relates to systemic processes involving interactions of multiple cell types and abnormally elevated intracellular Ca2+ . Injection of a Ca2+ chelator into Fig4-/- mice improved segmental demyelination, thereby providing a therapeutic strategy against demyelination. Ann Neurol 2018;83:756-770.",

Thus, the term NMDs encompasses a vast array of different syndromes. Some of these syndromes are of direct relevance to paediatric orthopaedic surgeons, either because the presenting manifestation is a functional sign (e.g., toe-walking) or deformity (e.g., pes cavus or scoliosis) suggesting a need for orthopaedic attention or because orthopaedic abnormalities requiring treatment develop during the course of a known NMD. The main NMDs relevant to the orthopaedic surgeon are infantile spinal muscular atrophy (a motor neuron disease), peripheral neuropathies (chiefly, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), congenital muscular dystrophies, progressive muscular dystrophies, and Steinert myotonic dystrophy (or myotonic dystrophy type 1). Muscle weakness is a symptom shared by all these conditions. The paediatric orthopaedic surgeon must be familiar, not only with the musculoskeletal system, but also with many other domains (particularly respiratory and cardiac function and nutrition) that may interfere with the treatment and require preoperative management. Good knowledge of the natural history of each NMD is essential to ensure optimal timing of the therapeutic interventions, which must be performed under the best possible conditions in these usually frail patients. Timing is particularly crucial for the treatment of spinal deformities due to paraspinal muscle hypotonia during growth: depending on the disease and natural history, the treatment may involve non-operative methods or growing rods, followed by spinal fusion. A multidisciplinary approach is always required. Finally, the survival gains achieved in recent years increasingly require attention to preparing for adult life, to orthopaedic problems requiring treatment before the patient leaves the paediatric environment, and to the transition towards the adult healthcare system.",

UDCA treatment has an uncertain impact on disease outcomes and has been reported in high doses to be associated with worse outcome in adults with PSC. In this context, controlled withdrawal and reintroduction of UDCA in children with PSC were studied. Prior to study initiation, participants were required to have alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) <2 times the upper limit of normal on stable UDCA dosing. The study included four phases: I (stable dosing), II (50% UDCA reduction), III (UDCA discontinuation), IV (UDCA reintroduction), with a primary endpoint of change in ALT and GGT between phases I and III. We enrolled 27 participants (22 completed) between March 2011 and June 2016. Changes in mean ALT and GGT between phases I and III were ALT, +29.5 IU/L (P = 0.105) and GGT, +60.4 IU/L (P = 0.003). In 7 participants, ALT and GGT ≤29 IU/L did not rise above 29 IU/L (null response group). Eight participants had increases of ALT or GGT >100 IU/L (flare group). None developed elevated bilirubin.

RESULTS:Sellar neoplasms have a worse outcome than pituitary adenomas that is related not only to their natural history but also to side effects of therapies and evolving endocrine and/or hypothalamic deficiencies. Recent imaging advances have established the radiological fingerprint of some of these neoplasms, and several chromosomal aberrations have also been identified. Although established approaches along with new surgical and radiotherapeutic approaches remain the main treatment modalities, recent evidence has provided insight into their molecular pathogenesis involving, other than chemotherapy, treatments with targeted agents as in gliomas and craniopharyngiomas bearing BRAF mutations. Development of predictive markers of recurrences may also identify high-risk patients, including proliferative markers and expression of the progesterone receptor in meningiomas, and lead to less aggressive surgery. Owing to the rarity and complexity of these neoplasms, patients should be managed in dedicated centers.

This is important to lower the risk of radiation-induced damage, especially in children. However, local adverse effects in proximity to the target volume may occur. In particular, the development of moyamoya syndrome (MMS) has been rarely reported in children receiving proton beam therapy for brain tumors.

The natural history of sacral chordoma is a slow growing tumour arising at the midline of the lower sacrum that can invade the sacrum and progressively increase in size expanding cranially and anteriorly. Metastasis is very rare even when the tumour is large. Sacral chordoma affects males more than females and is more commonly found in middle age and elderly patients. CASE PRESENTATION:A 25 years old female had neglected an extremely large midline sacral mass for 2 years. On presentation to hospital, she had been bed bound for the past 2 years. The sacral mass was so large that it prevented her from lying down supine and sitting on the wheelchair comfortably. Clinical examination showed a 40 cm × 30 cm × 20 cm hard mass over the sacrum that involved both buttocks and the gluteal fold. Neurological exam of bilateral lower limb was normal. Computed Tomography Scan of the Pelvis showed a large destructive sacrococcygeal mass measuring 43 cm × 38 cm × 27 cm with extension into the presacral space resulting in anterior displacement of the rectum, urinary bladder and uterus; and posterior extension into the dorsal soft tissue with involvement of the gluteus, piriformis, and left erector spinae muscles. Biopsy taken confirmed Chordoma. This patient was managed by a multidisciplinary team in an Oncology referral centre. The patient had undergone Wide En Bloc Resection and Sacrectomy, a complex surgery that was associated with complications namely bleeding, surgical site infection and neurogenic bowel and bladder. Six months post operatively the patient was able to lie supine and sit on wheelchair comfortably. She required extensive rehabilitation to help her ambulate in future. CONCLUSION:This is a rare case of neglected sacral chordoma in a young female treated with Wide En Bloc Resection and Sacrectomy associated with complications of this complex surgery. Nevertheless, surgery is still worthwhile to improve the quality of life and to prevent complications secondary to prolonged immobilization.

Till date, a few large series with long follow up are available in literature.All consecutive patients affected by primary localized sacral chordoma operated on at two Italian reference centers between 1981 and 2012 were included. Overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of local recurrence (LR), and distant metastases (DM) were calculated. Multivariable analyses for OS, DFS, LR, and DM were performed.A total of 99 patients were identified: 65 males and 34 females. Median age was 59 years (range 22-77 yrs), median tumor size was 9 cm (range 4-22). Nineteen patients received pre- or postoperative radiotherapy (RT). Wide (R0) surgical margins were achieved in 46 patients, marginal (R1) margins in 43 patients and intralesional (R2) margins in 10 patients.

Size of the tumor and quality of surgical margins were the only significant predictors of long-term outcome. DFS for 15 years was, in fact, 49% for R0 and 7% for R1, respectively.In this series, long-term outcome of resected sacral chordoma was poor, with less than 25% patients were disease-free at 15 years. Interestingly, only half of the patients treated with R0 resection had no evidence of recurrence at 15 years.

Primary tumor develops along the axial spine between the clivus and sacrum and develops from the residual embryonic notochord. Brachyury (T), a transcription factor required for normal embryonic development, is expressed in the notochord and overexpressed in almost all cases of chordoma. The primary treatment for chordoma is surgical excision with wide local margins, when possible. Radiotherapy also plays a significant role in the adjuvant setting and when surgery is not possible. Unfortunately, in the advanced and/or metastatic setting, where the role of surgery and/or radiation is less clear, treatment options are very limited.

The disorder involves attacks of chorea, which resolve within minutes, that may occur frequently throughout the day. CASE PRESENTATION:A 61-year-old woman presented to the clinic with a 13-year history of PKD first diagnosed in 2002. This patient had frequent episodic attacks of PKD, which were so severe she had difficulty with ambulation and other activities of daily living. The case was complicated by an additional diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. She refused antiseizure medication because of concerns about it exacerbating her fatigue. In the office, she was given weekly parenteral doses of vitamins and minerals, which almost completely eliminated her symptoms between treatments and allowed her to return to activities of daily living. DISCUSSION:Genetic testing, not related to her PKD diagnosis, revealed several mutations that could offer an explanation for the apparent efficacy of parenteral therapy in this patient.",

Most people with Huntington's disease (HD) develop dysarthria. Yet, how speech evolves, how the brain regulates speech in HD, and the clinical implications of these changes remain unclear. We reviewed existing literature on speech production in premanifest (PreHD) to symptomatic HD. A search of databases yielded 12 eligible studies. Nine of the twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis. Data suggest that speech in PreHD is characterized by impaired speech agility, phonatory function and speech rate. Over the disease course, speech gradually deteriorates across all subsystems of speech. Our findings indicate subtle changes in speech appear prior to a clinical diagnosis of HD. However, distinct patterns of decline and the magnitude of these deficits require further investigation. Our current understanding of speech impairment in HD relies on small cohort studies.

Leveraging the domain knowledge that certain neuroimaging biomarkers may reflect the disease pathology, we propose a model inspired by the neural mass model from cognitive neuroscience to jointly model nonlinear dynamic trajectories of the biomarkers. Under a nonlinear mixed-effects model framework, we introduce subject- and biomarker-specific random inflection points to characterize the critical time of underlying disease progression as reflected in the biomarkers. A latent liability score is shared across biomarkers to pool information. Our model allows assessing how the underlying disease progression will affect the trajectories of the biomarkers, and, thus, is potentially useful for individual disease management or preventive therapeutics. We propose an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation, where in the E step, a normal approximation is used to facilitate numerical integration. We perform extensive simulation studies and apply the method to analyze data from a large multisite natural history study of Huntington's Disease (HD). The results show that some neuroimaging biomarker inflection points are early signs of the HD onset.

The movement disorder typically presents between ages one and 6.5 years and is mainly dystonia that can be accompanied by chorea and/or ataxia. Over time some affected individuals require assistive devices for mobility. Speech fluency and intelligibility are progressively impaired due to dysarthria. Optic atrophy typically develops between ages four and 12 years and manifests as reduced visual acuity, which can include functional blindness (also known as legal blindness) in adulthood. Because only 13 affected individuals are known to the authors, and because nearly half of them were diagnosed retrospectively as adults, the natural history of disease progression and other aspects of the phenotype have not yet been completely defined. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of MECR-related neurologic disorder is established in a proband with a childhood-onset movement disorder and biallelic (compound heterozygous or homozygous) pathogenic variants in MECR identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Visual aids for decreased visual acuity due to optic atrophy; occupational therapy and physical therapy to maintain range of movement and special aids (e.g., braces, walkers, wheelchairs) to maintain/improve mobility; speech therapy for dysarthria and augmentative communication if needed. Medications that may relieve dystonia include anticholinergic agents, baclofen, and benzodiazepines. Surveillance: The following yearly examinations are warranted: ophthalmologic (need for additional visual aids), neurologic (need for medications to relieve dystonia), speech therapy (need for augmentative communication), cognitive evaluation, and feeding evaluation (assess risk of aspiration). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Stress and febrile illness as much as possible as these are presumed to exacerbate disease progression. Discuss anesthetic risks with a patient's medical team prior to surgical procedures. GENETIC COUNSELING:MECR-related neurologic disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the MECR pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

The birth prevalence of this disorder is approximately 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 8,000, and the life span of the majority of patients is less than 1 year. As information regarding outcome in trisomy 18 is rather fragmentary in the literature, this study is aimed at investigating the survival and natural history of trisomy 18. We also evaluated the survival age and management of trisomy 18 in two different periods, before and after the implementation of National Health Insurance (NHI) program. Thirty-nine cases of trisomy 18 were collected in Mackay Memorial Hospital in a 17-year period, from 1988 to 2004. Delivery data, survival age, management before and after the implementation of NHI program, structural defects, image findings and cytogenetic results were analyzed by medical and nurse's records. The diagnosis of trisomy 18 was based on the prenatal amniocentesis or postnatal chromosome analysis. Three patients had trisomy 18 mosaicism. Since cardiovascular and central nervous systems are the most common organ systems involved in this disorder, 31 patients received brain ultrasonography and heart ultrasonography for evaluation of their multiple anomalies after admission. All patients except one died in their first year due to severe malformations of the cardiovascular or central nervous systems. The median survival age was 6 days. We found a longer survival with female patients than with male patients (P < 0.05). Implementation of NHI program in the more recent decade of this study period was associated with longer survival of trisomy 18 (P < 0.05). The three most common structural defects were clenched hands (95%), rocker bottom feet (90%), and low set or malformed ears (90%). Low birth weight was present in 90%. By cardiac ultrasonography, the top four heart defects were ventricular septal defect (94%), patent ductus arteriosus (77%) and atrial septal defect (68%). However, ten cases (32%) had complex congenital heart defects. By brain ultrasonography, the most common brain lesion was cerebellar hypoplasia (32%), followed by brain edema (29%), enlarged cisterna magna (26%) and choroid plexus cysts (19%). Although most patients with trisomy 18 die within the first few weeks after birth, it is important to recognize that a small but notable percentage of these patients will survive the first year. When prenatal or postnatal decisions need to be made, the possibility of long-term survival should be included in any discussion to enable families to make the most appropriate decision.",

One of the most striking features is the early age of patients at the onset of the disease, showing swelling of the soft tissues overlaying bones, hyperirritability, and, subsequently, periosteal new bone production. The natural history of the disease proves to be self-limiting. Multiple areas are involved in the majority of cases. These polyostic forms are easily clinically diagnosed. But in rare monostic presentations, especially manifestations in the scapular region, there may be a great suspicion of a malignant tumor. Histologically, such lesion may also be misdiagnosed as a malignant neoplasm because of the great variety of microscopic appearances. This study was conducted into 5 cases (biopsies from one male and four female infants, 6 weeks to 4 months of age) to characterize the histological variability in the natural course of the disease. Electron microscopical investigations were additionally performed on two cases. Histologically, the process corresponds to typical ossifying periostitis. Three phases can be distinguished according to the main histological characteristics: 1. Acute inflammatory and proliferating phase; 2. Osteogenic phase; 3. Phase of remodelling. The first phase is characterized by a loss of periost, areas showing proliferation of fibroblast-like cells, and by edema of surrounding musculature. Infiltration by leucocytes was occasionally observed and was accompanied by micro-abscesses. The osteogenic phase was characterized by formation of woven bone. Ultrastructurally proliferations of osteogenic mesenchyma were found and resulted in typical mineralization patterns with matrix vesicles and interfibrillar depositions of hydroxyapatite crystals. Calcification of mitochondria was also detected. Viruses could not be observed. Only thread-like structures were found in the nuclei. At first interpretation, they appeared to be pathological protein depositions. However, further investigations will be necessary to elucidate their genesis. The pathogenesis is discussed.

The description of two ecosystems, one in the North with Fonsecaea pedrosoi evolving in the tropical rainforest and one in the South with Cladophialophora carrionii (41% of the whole sample) isolated in the spiny desert, demonstrates that the deforestation, in order to product charcoal and to build houses, is the primary factor associated with this disease.

Little is known about the genetic pathways that underlie early-onset breast cancer. Here we report the discovery of DEAR1 (ductal epithelium-associated RING Chromosome 1), a novel gene encoding a member of the TRIM (tripartite motif) subfamily of RING finger proteins, and provide evidence for its role as a dominant regulator of acinar morphogenesis in the mammary gland and as an independent predictor of local recurrence-free survival in early-onset breast cancer.Suppression subtractive hybridization identified DEAR1 as a novel gene mapping to a region of high-frequency loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a number of histologically diverse human cancers within Chromosome 1p35.1. In the breast epithelium, DEAR1 expression is limited to the ductal and glandular epithelium and is down-regulated in transition to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), an early histologic stage in breast tumorigenesis. DEAR1 missense mutations and homozygous deletion (HD) were discovered in breast cancer cell lines and tumor samples. Introduction of the DEAR1 wild type and not the missense mutant alleles to complement a mutation in a breast cancer cell line, derived from a 36-year-old female with invasive breast cancer, initiated acinar morphogenesis in three-dimensional (3D) basement membrane culture and restored tissue architecture reminiscent of normal acinar structures in the mammary gland in vivo. Stable knockdown of DEAR1 in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) recapitulated the growth in 3D culture of breast cancer cell lines containing mutated DEAR1, in that shDEAR1 clones demonstrated disruption of tissue architecture, loss of apical basal polarity, diffuse apoptosis, and failure of lumen formation. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray from a cohort of 123 young female breast cancer patients with a 20-year follow-up indicated that in early-onset breast cancer, DEAR1 expression serves as an independent predictor of local recurrence-free survival and correlates significantly with strong family history of breast cancer and the triple-negative phenotype (ER(-), PR(-), HER-2(-)) of breast cancers with poor prognosis.Our data provide compelling evidence for the genetic alteration and loss of expression of DEAR1 in breast cancer, for the functional role of DEAR1 in the dominant regulation of acinar morphogenesis in 3D culture, and for the potential utility of an immunohistochemical assay for DEAR1 expression as an independent prognostic marker for stratification of early-onset disease.",

Therefore, the authors analyzed multiple areas of each cancer with a clonality assay based on trinucleotide repeat length polymorphism of the human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA) that was subject to random inactivation of X chromosomes. METHODS:The HUMARA assay was applied to 15 gastric carcinomas, early and advanced stage, manifested in superficial, depressed lesions of various sizes and at least some signet ring cells. DNA was extracted from fresh frozen and formalin fixed tumor tissues that were microdissected from the mucosal lesions, and the HUMARA locus was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with and without prior digestion of nonmethylated DNA with Hpa II. The amplified DNA samples were loaded on polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and visualized by a silver-staining method. RESULTS:In the 15 cases examined, 9 cancers were informative (had features of the types sought in this study), and in these 9 cancers a total of 57 areas were analyzed. In 7 of the 9 cancers, the inactivated allele was common to all the informative areas of each tumor, irrespective of the macroscopic shape of the tumor or the degree of histologic heterogeneity within it. In one of the two remaining cancers, the inactivated allele of one of the areas examined was different from those in the other areas. CONCLUSIONS:Most of the superficial depressed-type gastric carcinomas in this study were demonstrated to be of monoclonal origin. This finding supports a notion expressed previously in the literature that superficial-type carcinoma has a long natural history, and it indicates that efforts to detect gastric carcinomas in early stages to improve patients' survival should be encouraged.",

Despite the continuous discharges, the patients had relatively subtle clinical episodes of seizures, during which they were sometimes responsive to verbal stimuli. Intravenous antiepileptic drugs (AED) had little effect on the rhythmic EEG. No lesion in their MRIs contributed to NCSE. Ring chromosome 20 was found in 20% of female karyotype in both patients [46,XX,r(20) (p13 q13)/46,XX] but were negative in four healthy siblings. Oral AEDs decreased more than 75% of the overt CPS episodes in both patients at 22 and 26 months of follow-up but had no effect on the natural history of electrical NCSE. The patients' daily activities were minimally affected by the ongoing electrical discharges. These are the first two cases reported of ring chromosome 20 with NCSE in Thailand. Our patients present a rather benign and pharmacologically responsive course probably because of the low percentage of r(20) mosaicism. The electroclinical correlations in our cases raise the possibility that the mechanism of continuous rhythmic waves in this syndrome may be unrelated to epilepsy. Assessing the severity of this syndrome using both clinical seizures and EEG is crucial.",

Therefore, the authors analyzed multiple areas of each cancer with a clonality assay based on trinucleotide repeat length polymorphism of the human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA) that was subject to random inactivation of X chromosomes. METHODS:The HUMARA assay was applied to 15 gastric carcinomas, early and advanced stage, manifested in superficial, depressed lesions of various sizes and at least some signet ring cells. DNA was extracted from fresh frozen and formalin fixed tumor tissues that were microdissected from the mucosal lesions, and the HUMARA locus was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with and without prior digestion of nonmethylated DNA with Hpa II. The amplified DNA samples were loaded on polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and visualized by a silver-staining method. RESULTS:In the 15 cases examined, 9 cancers were informative (had features of the types sought in this study), and in these 9 cancers a total of 57 areas were analyzed. In 7 of the 9 cancers, the inactivated allele was common to all the informative areas of each tumor, irrespective of the macroscopic shape of the tumor or the degree of histologic heterogeneity within it. In one of the two remaining cancers, the inactivated allele of one of the areas examined was different from those in the other areas. CONCLUSIONS:Most of the superficial depressed-type gastric carcinomas in this study were demonstrated to be of monoclonal origin. This finding supports a notion expressed previously in the literature that superficial-type carcinoma has a long natural history, and it indicates that efforts to detect gastric carcinomas in early stages to improve patients' survival should be encouraged.",

Thirty-eight papers, reporting on 991 patients, met the inclusion criteria and were used for this review. The pooled estimate of the prevalence of pain at any point within the course of CIDP was 46% (95% CI 36-57%). Immune treatment of CIDP might be adequate as monotherapy for the management of pain.

To our knowledge, this is the first case involving an adult presenting with GBS following bacterial meningitis. CASE PRESENTATION:A 46-year man with type 2 diabetes and otitis media (OM) suffered with fever, headache, and vomiting for 6 days. The patient's neck stiffness was obvious and the Kernig and Brudzinski signs were produced. The result of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and cytological examination of the CSF supported the diagnose of bacterial meningitis. On day 17 the patient felt numbness in both hands and feet, which gradually progressed to weakness of the limbs. Bladder dysfunction occurred, which required catheterization. The patient showed a tetraparesis with emphasis on the legs. The deep tendon reflexes of limbs were absent. The patient had peripheral hypalgesia and deep sensory dysfunction. The symptoms were possibly a result of GBS. Nerve conduction study showed that the F wave latency of the upper and lower limbs was prolonged, particularly the lower limbs. 8 days later the repeated nerve conduction study showed a low compound muscle action potential (3.3 mV) with a normal distal motor latency (14.2 ms) and a low motor nerve conduction velocity (34.3 m/s) in the tibial nerve. The patient still required assistance when walking 3 months after onset. CONCLUSIONS:GBS following bacterial meningitis is rare and limbs weakness in patients with bacterial meningitis was usually considered because of weakness. This case should serve as a reminder for clinical doctors that when a patient with bacterial meningitis complains about limbs numbness or weakness, GBS should be considered, especially when the patient had diabetes mellitus (DM) history.",

Autosomic dominant inheritance is present in most cases but in CINCA/NOMID syndrome where neomutations are more common. Mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin, NLRP3, are associated with deregulation of caspase-1 activity, excessive interleukin-1 production and an autoinflammatory syndrome, which in familial cold urticaria and Muckle-Wells syndrome may be triggered or worsened by exposure to coldness. More and more mutations are described and even somatic mutations that can explain some clinical signs beginning in adulthood. Patients disclose a pseudo-urticarial rash, arthralgia, headaches, sometimes fever, biological inflammation but also, in severe forms of the disease, neurologic inflammation with central deafness, ophthalmologic inflammation, chronic meningitis.

This study was undertaken to determine the characteristics, presentation, natural history, and response to treatment in 46 patients who had been referred for evaluation at the UK National Amyloidosis Centre. METHODS: Disease activity was monitored by serial measurement of serum amyloid A. Renal function was assessed by measurement of serum creatinine and albumin levels, the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria from 24-hour urine collections. The amyloid load was measured by serum amyloid P scintigraphy. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had familial Mediterranean fever, 12 patients had tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, 6 patients had cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, and 4 patients had mevalonate kinase deficiency. The median age at onset of HPFS was 5 years; median age at presentation with AA amyloidosis was 38 years. Diagnosis of an HPFS had not been considered prior to presentation with AA amyloidosis in 23 patients (50%). Eleven patients (24%) had end-stage renal failure (ESRF) at presentation; of these, 3 had received transplants prior to referral. A further 13 patients developed ESRF over the followup period, with 10 undergoing renal transplantation. The median time to progression to ESRF from onset of AA amyloidosis was 3.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2-8), with a median time to transplant of 4 years (IQR 3-6). Eleven patients (24%) died. The median survival in the entire cohort was 19 years from diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. Of the 37 patients who were treated successfully, or in whom at least partial suppression of the underlying HPFS was achieved, 17 (46%) showed amyloid regression, 14 (38%) showed a stable amyloid load, and 2 (5%) showed increased amyloid deposition over the followup period. CONCLUSION: AA amyloidosis remains a challenging and serious late complication of HPFS; however, outcomes are excellent when HPFS is diagnosed early enough to allow effective treatment, thus preventing or retarding further amyloid deposition and organ damage.",

METHODS: Five cases of chylous ascites following pancreatectomy from April 2001 through March 2004 were studied retrospectively. The milk test was carried out prospectively. Such rates as positivity and incidence of ascites were examined.

We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus for studies that described lung function in 10 or more patients with PCD. We performed meta-analyses and meta-regression to explain heterogeneity. We included 24 studies, ranging from 13 to 158 patients per study. The most commonly reported spirometric indices were forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity presented as mean and standard deviation of percent predicted values. We found considerable heterogeneity for both parameters (I 2=94-96%). The heterogeneity remained when we stratified the analysis by age; however, FEV1 in adult patients was lower. Even after taking into account explanatory factors, the largest part of the between-studies variance remained unexplained. Heterogeneity could be explained by genetic differences between study populations, methodological factors related to the variability of study inclusion criteria or details on the performance and evaluation of lung function measurements that we could not account for. Prospective studies therefore need to use standardised protocols and international reference values.

Here, we examine the transcriptomic response to predator kairomones of two functionally distinct developmental stages in embryos of the aquatic snail Radix balthica: E8-the stage at which a range-finding trial indicated that kairomone-induced accelerated growth and development first occurred; and E9-the stage at which embryos switched from ciliary- to crawling-driven locomotion. We tested whether expression profiles were influenced by kairomones and whether this influence varied between stages. We also identified potential candidate genes for investigating mechanisms underpinning induced responses. There were 6,741 differentially expressed transcripts between developmental stages, compared to just five in response to predator kairomones. However, on examination of functional enrichment in the transcripts responding to predator kairomones and adopting a less stringent significance threshold, 206 transcripts were identified relating to muscle function, growth, and development, with this response being greater at the later E9 stage. Furthermore, these transcripts included putative annotations for genes identified as responding to predator kairomones in other taxa, including C1q, lectin, and actin domains. Globally, transcript expression appeared reduced in response to predator kairomones and we hypothesize that this might be a result of metabolic suppression, as has been reported in other taxa in response to predation threat.",

STUDY DESIGN:The Clinical Registry Investigating BBS, a worldwide registry exploring the phenotype and natural history of BBS, was used to conduct the study. Protected health information was obtained by subject or family interview and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-approved release of data including imaging studies and genetic testing. Echocardiography and imaging findings were independently confirmed by 2 cardiologists. RESULTS:Thoraco-abdominal abnormalities were identified in 6 of 368 (1.6%) subjects with a minimum prevalence of 1 in 60 Clinical Registry Investigating BBS participants. Diverse laterality defects were observed suggesting that the underlying ciliopathy randomly alters embryonic left-right axis orientation. Congenital heart disease, common in heterotaxy, was present in 2 subjects. Additional defects, uncommonly reported in BBS, were observed in the central nervous, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems in the subjects. No BBS genotype was favored in the cohort. One subject had genetic and clinical phenotype diagnostic of both primary ciliary dyskinesia and BBS. CONCLUSIONS:The variety of thoraco-abdominal abnormalities in BBS suggests the pleiotropic nature of these anomalies is not confined to a single pattern or genotype. Clinicians providing care to individuals with BBS should consider the increased prevalence of thoraco-abdominal anomalies in BBS. Individuals with features suggestive of other ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, should undergo further evaluation for additional genetic disorders.

Two theories for this larval type have been prevalent, the trochaea theory and the theory proposed by Ivanova-Kazas. The embryology, or more precisely the cell-lineage, of these larvae seems to be central for our understanding of their origin, but important details have been missing. According to the trochaea theory, a circumblastoporal ring of blastomeres differentiates to follow the convoluted shape of the conspicuous ciliary bands of the larvae, with prototroch and metatroch around the mouth, forming a filtering system, and telotroch around the anus. According to the Ivanova-Kazas theory, the blastomeres with the ciliary bands develop through specialization of rings of cells of the general ciliation in a lecithotrophic larva. Now, a new cell-lineage study of the gastropod Crepidula has shown that the ring of cells at the edge of the blastopore develops into the band of cells carrying prototroch and metatroch, characteristic of the trochophora.

It is challenging to designate such various appearances, to understand their etiopathogenesis, and to choose the most appropriate management. Literature was reviewed for diagnostic criteria, pregnancy history, clinical findings, brain development, survival rate, initial perioperative management, and postsurgical midfacial growth in cleft patients with HPE. The findings were compared with a clinical database of 85 cleft patients with HPE at the Department of Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery, University of Pretoria. Aims of Part 1:The aim of the study is to overcome disparities widely existing among clinicians regarding definitive diagnostic criteria, especially in cases with a common appearance of a uni- or bilateral cleft lip alveolus or cleft lip, alveolus and palate deformity, and cases presenting facial structural agenesis. Materials and Methods:A literature search related to diagnostic criteria was compared to results of a cleft HPE database from a single tertiary institution. Results:HPE cleft cases can be allocated to one of the following subdivisions: (1) columella complex agenesis (Ag-Colum), (2) prolabium-premaxilla-columella complex agenesis in cleft lip-alveolus deformities (Ag-CLA), (3) prolabium-premaxilla-columella agenesis in cases with complete cleft lip alveolus palate (Ag-CLAP), and (4) standard type (holoprosencephaly in patients with a standard cleft) with uni- or bilateral CLA or CLAP, hard and soft palate cleft (hPsP), and atrophic premaxillae, with or without single central incisor.

The location of IOF within the maxilla of infants is different from adults. However, little information about anatomy of IOF in infants exists in the literature. This study aims to determine the location of IOF in infant dry skulls based on key surgical landmarks. METHODS:All dry skulls under age 2 years old were selected from the Hamann-Todd Human Osteological Collection at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (Cleveland, OH). Specimens without cranial bones or complete maxilla were excluded. Seven anatomical measurements were taken on each side of the face for each individual skull (14 measurements for each skull). Anatomical landmarks used for the measurements included infraorbital rim, aperture piriformis, alveolar ridge, zygomaticomaxillary buttress, anterior nasal spine (ANS), and inferolateral corner of the aperture piriformis. RESULTS:Twenty-seven halves of 14 dry skulls were included in the final analysis. The mean age of specimens was 0.57 years. Mean distances from infraorbital foramen to infraorbital rim, aperture piriformis, alveolar ridge, zygomaticomaxillary, and ANS buttress were 4.11 ± 0.82, 9.4 ± 1.62, 12.7 ± 2.71, 11.7 ± 1.54, and 18.4 ± 2.11 mm, respectively.

The present investigation examines the natural history of the macroglossia associated with a case of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and its influence on dentofacial development. Facial skeletal growth and tongue size were assessed by analyzing cephalometric radiographs from age 2 months to 7.5 years. The data were compared with cephalometric norms and new normative data derived from 13 patients with cleft lip. The major influence of the macroglossia was protrusion of dentoalveolar structures, particularly in the lower jaw. This resulted in an anterior cross-bite in the primary dentition. In addition, an abnormally obtuse gonial angle was observed increasing the effective length of the mandible. Tongue size in BWS was generally greater than the norm, but the increase with age paralleled the mean growth curve of the tongue in the control. Over time the base of the tongue became longer and the hyoid bone moved posteriorly and inferiorly, allowing for accommodation of the tongue within the oral cavity. The changes in tongue shape and dentofacial morphology support the position that early partial glossectomy should be delayed or abandoned. In cases where tongue reduction is considered necessary, the new cephalometric normative data on tongue size provided herein can be used to establish objective criteria for such surgery.",

Screening for congenital hypothyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, biotinidase deficiency, and a few additional disorders was added by others over the years. However, a very large expansion of covered metabolic disorders eluded Guthrie despite his best efforts. This required a new screening technology, tandem mass spectrometry, which was not available until recently. Now, almost all developed newborn screening program use tandem mass spectrometry to cover the 29 metabolic disorders recommended for coverage by the American College of Medical Genetics and additional secondary disorders. The results have in some cases been spectacular in preventing or greatly reducing the burden of disease imposed by many of the screened disorders. However, expanded newborn screening has also brought problems that need to be addressed. These include lack of knowledge about the natural history of some of the disorders, absence of effective preventive therapy for others, identification of seemingly benign disorders or benign variants of severe disorders, and the resulting parental anxiety. To address these and other issues brought by expanded newborn screening, a national effort led by the American College of Medical Genetics has been developed. This effort known as the Newborn Screening Translational Research Network seeks to stimulate research, advocate pilot screening programs for proposed new additions to screening, and develop a protocol-based systematic long-term follow-up of infants identified in expanded screening programs. Upon the outcome, this critical effort will depend on the health and well-being of children throughout the United States.",

We recently treated a 14-year-old female patient with CLAH and ovarian cyst torsion. As a neonate, she presented with vomiting, skin pigmentation, and electrolyte imbalance. At that time, her serum adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration was elevated, while 17-hydroxypregnenolone level was normal, as were her normal female external genitalia. Mutation analysis showed that she was homozygous for p.Q258X in the StAR gene. She underwent spontaneous puberty and menstruation.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of isolated hand macrodactyly cases treated at our institution over a 15-year period. Data on clinical presentation, procedure details, and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients, 8 boys and 13 girls, were identified. Patients had a mean of 1.8 affected digits (median, 2; range, 1-3); most (n = 12; 57%) presented with multiple affected digits. The middle finger was most commonly affected (67%). Most patients had progressive overgrowth (n = 13; 67%). Twelve patients (57%) had nerve territory-oriented macrodactyly, whereas 9 (43%) presented with lipomatous type. There were no differences between the types of macrodactyly in sex, affected side, rate of growth, digits affected, or number of procedures. Patients underwent a mean of 3.2 staged corrective operations (median, 2; range, 1-12), including soft tissue debulking (n = 19 patients; 90%), ostectomy for volume reduction or partial amputation (n = 9; 43%), closing wedge osteotomy (n = 11; 52%), epiphysiodesis (n = 7; 33%), digit transfer (n = 3; 14%), toe transfer (n = 1; 5%), and ray amputation (n = 6; 29%). Patients with progressive growth underwent more procedures than patients with static growth. No major complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of macrodactyly should be reserved for patients with isolated congenital digit overgrowth affecting all tissue types, but clinical presentation and natural history of macrodactyly can vary greatly among patients. A variety of surgical techniques exist to reconstruct rather than amputate affected digits primarily. Although reconstruction will not result in a normal digit and requires multiple operations, our observations suggest that they are well tolerated and may offer some restored function and aesthetics. More long-term outcomes and insight into the biological basis of this disorder are needed to make better-informed treatment decisions. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",

The natural history of the disease is extremely unfavorable and once a fracture occurs, there is a little or no tendency for the lesion to heal spontaneously. It is challenging to treat effectively this difficult condition and its possible complications. Treatment is mainly surgical and it aims to obtain a long term bone union, to prevent limb length discrepancies, to avoid mechanical axis deviation, soft tissue lesions, nearby joint stiffness, and pathological fracture. The key to get primary union is to excise hamartomatous tissue and pathological periosteum. Age at surgery, status of fibula, associated shortening, and deformities of leg and ankle play significant role in primary union and residual challenges after primary healing. Unfortunately, none of invasive and noninvasive methods have proven their superiority. Surgical options such as intramedullary nailing, vascularized fibula graft, and external fixator, have shown equivocal success rate in achieving primary union although they are often associated with acceptable results. Amputation must be reserved for failed reconstruction, severe limb length discrepancy and gross deformities of leg and ankle. Distinct advantages, complications, and limitation of each primary treatment as well as strategies to deal with potential complications have been described.

Thus, vaccination to interrupt postnatal HCMV transmission is an attractive strategy to prevent HCMV spread and congenital infection. Rhesus CMV (RhCMV) in nonhuman primates is a valuable model for the study of immune strategies to prevent CMV transmission. Although rhesus monkeys typically acquire RhCMV before 1 year of age, the timing and mode of natural infant RhCMV transmission remain unknown. METHODS:We followed 5 RhCMV-seropositive dams and their infants from birth until weaning, approximately 6 months later. RhCMV DNA levels in plasma, breast milk, saliva, and urine were measured every 2 weeks by quantitative PCR. RhCMV-specific T cell responses in peripheral blood and breast milk were measured by interferon gamma ELISpot assays. Serum IgG antibody levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS:Four of five postpartum RhCMV-seropositive mothers had intermittent, low-level RhCMV shedding in breast milk, whereas all had high-magnitude RhCMV shedding in saliva and urine. The kinetics of maternal blood RhCMV-specific T cell responses and viral shedding in urine and saliva did not strongly associate, though dams with consistently high systemic RhCMV-specific T cell responses tended to have undetectable RhCMV shedding in breast milk. All RhCMV-exposed infants had intermittent, low-level RhCMV shedding in saliva during the lactation period, with minimal systemic RhCMV-specific T cell responses. CONCLUSIONS:Despite exposure to RhCMV shedding in breast milk and other maternal fluids, postnatal mother-to-child RhCMV transmission appears to be less efficient than that of HCMV. A greater understanding of the determinants of RhCMV transmission and its usefulness as a model of HCMV mucosal acquisition may provide insight into strategies to prevent HCMV infections in humans.",

The study aimed to analyze the characteristics of TORCH screening in reproductive age women. METHODS:A total of 18,104 women (2015-2017) from a teaching hospital in Xi'an, China, were enrolled in the study. The characteristics of TORCH screening, i.e., the application of TORCH test, the seroprevalence, the impact of age, periods of gestation and woman with bad obstetric history (BOH) on the serological data were investigated. RESULTS:In the study, 319 women (1.76%) performed dynamic TORCH test. 51.66, 20.44 and 3.83% of the population did the test in the pre-gestation period, the first and third trimester, respectively. Quite a few pre-gestation women (29.74%) ignored screening of IgG antibodies. The overall IgG/IgM seropositvity of TOX, RV, CMV, HSV-1 and HSV-2 was 4.35%/0.35, 90%/0.63, 96.79%/0.97, 81.11%/0.14 and 6.1%/0.19%, respectively. The age-specific distributions and periods of gestation had no significant effect on the seroprevalence of TORCH agents, p>0.05. However, BOH was significantly associated with higher seropositvity of IgM (RV, CMV, HSV-1 and HSV-2) and IgG (CMV and HSV-1) antibodies, p < 0.05. CONCLUSION:In Xi'an region, more attentions should be paid to TOX, CMV, HSV-2 and the women with BOH for TORCH screening. Meanwhile, a greater emphasis needs to be placed on TORCH test used inappropriately in China.",

The operation performed was a transgastric cystgastrostomy with endoscopic guidance for a pancreatic pseudocyst. This operation was completed entirely through an existing gastrostomy site with no incisions, thus avoiding the peritoneal cavity. METHODS: This is a case of a 7-year-old boy with neurologic impairment from congenital herpes simplex virus encephalitis who is tube fed. He had acute pancreatitis and developed a 9 cm pancreatic pseudocyst. The pseudocyst failed to resolve after 6 weeks and developed a mature wall. Due to a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and known abdominal adhesions, a minimally invasive approach that would avoid entering the peritoneal cavity was the desired approach. The technique involved a trans-oral endoscope for visualization and the use of the gastrostomy as access to the gastric lumen and pseudocyst. The pancreatic pseudocyst was stabilized with two T-fasteners and confirmed with needle aspiration under endoscopic visualization. The pseudocyst was then opened with the LigaSure (Valleylab, Boulder, CO). The cystgastrostomy anastomosis was completed with an Endopath ETS-Flex Articulating Linear Stapler/Cutter (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc, Cincinnati, OH). The operation took less than 2 hours and was completed without an incision. Under the policies of the Human Research Protection Program, review of a single case is outside the scope of the definition of human subjects research and does not require institutional review board review and approval. RESULTS: The patient did well postoperatively and had a dramatic reduction in size of the pancreatic pseudocyst to 3.5 cm by 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid NOTES cystgastrostomy performed through an existing gastrocutaneous fistula is an excellent approach for minimally invasive drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts.",

DATA SOURCES: A Medline search of the 1966-July 2007 database was supplemented by search of the additional database Embase (1980-July 2007). Manual search was conducted of references of identified papers and book chapters. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were sought that were longitudinal in design, to include an inception cohort of children infected with (or exposed to) HSV who were entered at a similar point at birth and followed over time with serial audiometry to identify hearing loss if it developed. DATA EXTRACTION: Patient information and audiometric data extraction from relevant articles was performed independently by all three researchers. Discrepancies were resolved by mutual consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Three papers reported five children with SNHL following apparent disseminated HSV-2 infections in which other obvious clinical sequelae of HSV infection and co-morbid conditions were present. Audiometric information is lacking regarding onset and progression. There are no reports of delayed-onset SNHL following perinatal or asymptomatic HSV infection. CONCLUSIONS: The development of SNHL in children with exposure to HSV occurs rarely. Routine serological screening for HSV infection in otherwise healthy neonates newly diagnosed with SNHL is unjustified. There is insufficient data to define the incidence and natural history of SNHL in children with HSV infections. Carefully designed and conducted studies are needed to address this issue.",

Mutations in the POU1F1 gene are characterized by growth hormone (GH), thyrotropin, and prolactin deficiencies, commonly presenting with growth retardation and central hypothyroidism. Since the first report in 1992, more than 25 mutations have been identified in POU1F1. Case Description: We describe a 17-year-old male who presented to our Pediatric Endocrinology clinic with extreme short stature (height 81.7 cm, -9.3 SD), cognitive impairment, deaf-mutism, and neurological disabilities. L-thyroxine supplemental therapy, which had been initiated at the age of 6 months but ceased due to non-compliance, was reintroduced at presentation.

Although there are no publications associating Armour Thyroid and major coronary events, significant drug interactions may exist. A 32-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, cystic acne, and solitary congenital kidney presented to the emergency room after experiencing crushing substernal chest pain radiating to his left shoulder, accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath. The patient denied any tobacco use or family history of heart disease. He was self-administering 120 mg of Armour Thyroid daily.   On examination, the patient was well-developed with cystic acne and a flushed appearance. His vital signs on admission were a blood pressure of 171/106 mmHg, heart rate of 88 beats per minute (bpm), and respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min. The electrocardiogram revealed marked ST-segment elevation in the anterior chest leads. Laboratory studies revealed elevated troponins. Urine drug screen was negative. The patient underwent an emergent coronary angiogram, which confirmed an occluded left anterior descending artery. He was treated successfully by thrombectomy and stenting of his left anterior descending artery. Evaluation for other causes of thrombosis was negative: glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) 5.5%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 127 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 33 mg/dL, hypercoagulable evaluation negative, and hemoglobin (Hgb) 17.1 gm/dL. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were < 0.20 miu/mL. Thyroid profile results were thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.20 miu/mL (low), T3 free 4.08 pg/mL (high), and T4 total 1.2 mcg/dL (low), which were consistent with exogenous thyroid hormone administration. Focused questioning triggered by his cystic acne led to the discovery that the patient was self-administering exogenous testosterone replacement therapy. The patient declined to share specifics with the healthcare team. This was confirmed by a high testosterone level of 1,311 ng/dL. Hyperthyroidism increases the risk of cardiovascular events two to three times through the propagation of a hypercoagulable, hypofibrinolytic state possibly via an increase in clotting factors, a decrease in fibrinolytic enzymes, and an increased inhibition of the protein C pathway. The effect of androgens on cardiovascular mortality is uncertain. Androgens stimulate the hemostatic system, increase adverse lipid profile, and erythropoiesis. The combined therapy likely resulted in a synergistic potentiation of hypercoagulable, hypofibrinolytic effects of both agents. Given the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors, the cause of the myocardial infarction in our patient was likely due to drug interaction between Armour Thyroid and exogenous testosterone therapy. Due to the potential drug interaction between both natural and prescribed thyroid hormone and testosterone supplements, patients should be discouraged from self-administration of thyroid or anabolic steroids. Due to the lack of standardization in the T3 content, the use of Armour Thyroid should be avoided.",

Follow-up studies included complete blood count, blood chemistry, abdominal ultrasound, echocardiography, and T2*MRI. Main complications were due to anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis [osteoporosis (8/9, 89%), cholelithiasis (21/30, 70%), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (6/25, 24%)] and iron overload [hypothyroidism (9/24, 38%), and diabetes mellitus (6/32, 19%)].

Three patients died (9%) at the age of 46-56 due to PAH (1) and sepsis (2). All previously underwent splenectomy. Analyzing both our patients and the 21 patients previously described by Heimpel et al. (Blood 107:334, 2006), we conclude that adults with CDA I suffer significant morbidity and mortality. Careful monitoring of iron overload and prompt iron chelation therapy is mandatory. Due to possible complications and inconsistent response to splenectomy α-interferon, transfusion therapy or stem cell transplantation should be considered as alternatives to this procedure in severely affected patients.",

The greatest increase has occurred in mildly affected patients, many of whom have a eutopic thyroid gland. Congenital hypothyroidism may be transient or persistent, but the natural history cannot be predicted by severity at diagnosis. In premature infants, who are especially vulnerable to hypothyroidism, the rise in thyroid-stimulating hormone may be delayed and therefore detected only by routine follow-up screening. Recent studies of defects in thyroid hormone synthesis have focused on the role of mutations in the dual oxidase system and of a novel apical iodide transporter, anoctamin 1. Finally, emerging data suggest that exposure to excess thyroid hormone may be as harmful as hypothyroidism to long-term cognitive development.Although newborn screening has virtually eradicated mental retardation due to congenital hypothyroidism in parts of the world, new information continues to accumulate and new questions to arise about the diagnosis, physiology, and optimal management of this disorder.",

912,GARD:0001495,Congenital mitral malformation,30725821,['Review'],Aortic Valve Replacement,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30725821,"The aortic valve is a semilunar valve with three leaflets, which lies at the junction of left ventricle and aorta. It allows unidirectional blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. Because of the highly complex and sophisticated cellular and molecular functions, the thin valve leaflet can withstand extreme mechanical and hemodynamic forces with every cardiac cycle.[1] Various factors including age and congenital defects can compromise the normal valvular function leading to a wide variety of complications.[2] Although bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are the most common congenital abnormality, congenital valve defects can range from aortic atresia (missing or incomplete closure of aortic valves) to a sub or supra-valvular stenosis. BAV is reported to have an incidence of 1 to 2% with a male predominance. Lack of microfibrillar proteins during valvulogenesis has been reported to affect the leaflet development where two leaflets are fused to form one large leaflet. It frequently correlates with aortic abnormalities such as aortic dilation (root, ascending and arch) and coarctation of the aorta.[3] The bicuspid aortic valve leaflets can undergo accelerated calcific degeneration because of abnormal hemodynamic forces. Congenital abnormalities including BAV can lead to various valvular complications including aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation leading to an increased risk to infective endocarditis, which has a reported incidence of 12 to 39% in BAV.[3] Unless severe, BAV generally remains asymptomatic till the age of 50 to 60 years. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a narrowing of the valve aperture reducing the aortic valve area. Increased resistance to blood flow and transvalvular pressure gradient causes increased left ventricle workload causing hypertrophy. Its prevalence increases with age and can be as high as 4.6% in people greater than age 75 years. Being the most common valvular disease in Europe and America, estimates are that 3.5 million people in England alone will have AS by the year 2020.[4] Calcific degeneration leading to stiffening and restriction motion of valve leaflet is the most common cause of AS. Disruption of endothelium lining on the aortic side caused by increased mechanical stress seem to be the inciting event. Posterior leaflets are reported to be affected the most.[5] Rheumatic fever causing inflammation of the leaflets is still the leading cause of AS in developing countries. AS can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms of syncope, angina and heart failure.[6] Severe AS is fatal with a 50% mortality at 2 years.[7] As per The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, AS is graded severe when the orifice area is less than 1.0 cm, the mean gradient is greater than 40 mmHg or the jet velocity is greater than 4 m/s. Prognosis is poor in symptomatic or severe cases unless the valve is replaced. Up to 30% of patients aged > 75 do not undergo surgical valve replacement either because of technical reasons; this may include porcelain aorta, general frailty, refusal to undergo surgery, and serious comorbid conditions.[8] The operative death risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is as high as 10% in patients with LV dysfunction, chronic renal disease, and advanced age.[9] Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR/TAVI) have emerged as a more feasible and less risky option for patients not suitable for surgery. Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle when the valve leaflets fail to coapt. Common causes include congenital defects, calcific degeneration, infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever, and trauma.[10][11][12][13] Ventricular hypertrophy in chronic cases accommodates increased volume to maintain the normal stroke volume and end-diastolic pressure; hence, chronic AR can be asymptomatic for decades.[14] In contrast, with acute cases of AR, ventricles do not have enough time to undergo the needed changes such as hypertrophy to accommodate increased volumes. Because of decreased stroke volume, the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output but is insufficient to meet the demand resulting in increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. On physical examination, AR murmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after the aortic component of S (A); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal intercostal space. It also has associations with various other murmurs including: “Mid-systolic murmur” because of rapid ejection of an overload of blood from the left ventricle, “Austin Flint” murmur is mid-to-late diastolic murmur due to partial closure of mitral valve during ventricular systole because of regurgitant flow from aortic valve, “Cole-Cecil” is a diastolic murmur due to the fusion of an aortic murmur with the S3 because of simultaneous filling of the left ventricle from left atrium and AR. History of valvular surgery Dr. Theodore Tuffier, in 1912, used his finger to free the fused leaflets of a stenosed aortic valve.[15] Before the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mitral valve repair involved commissurotomy through access from the left atrial chamber. Thomas Homes Sellors performed first pulmonary valvulotomy in 1948 by using a tenotomy knife.[16] Charles Hufnagel developed the first artificial valve based on a reciprocating ball and cage. It was used to prevent backflow of blood into the ventricles due to aortic insufficiency.[17] CPB machine revolutionized the valve replacement in the anatomical position. Dr. Dwight Harken and his colleagues performed the first successful aortic valve replacement. Later that year, Drs. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards performed mitral valve replacement.[18] Bioprosthetic valves are closer in function to natural valves but have a limited life expectancy, whereas, Mechanical valves are more durable but require anticoagulation. The choice of valves, among other factors, depends upon the patient’s age and well-being. Mechanical heart valves are known to last for approximately 25 years. Seventy different mechanical heart valves have been developed since 1960.[19] Ball and cage, bi-leaflet, and tilting disc are the common ones. Modification of the ball valve by Dr. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards entailed developing a cage made of lucite with a silicone elastomer ball. The cage material was later changed to stainless steel and then cobalt-chromium alloys. The Starr-Edward valve also has a Teflon sewing ring, which enabled suturing into mitral and later into the aortic position.[20]  Increased thrombogenicity has been a significant issue, for which valves underwent several modifications such as measures to reduce metal contact by covering the struts with cloth and using Silastic shields. Other issues included hemolysis due to excessive rubbing of the ball against the sewing ring and occlusion of coronary ostia because of high profile. Despite these issues, these valves showed the feasibility of prosthetic valve enabling Starr-Edwards to draw design criteria. Basic points included that the valves should be chemically inert, biocompatible, a-traumatic to blood, and non-thrombogenic.[21]  In 1965, Kay-Shiley’s non-rotating disc valve replaced the ball with a single disc but demonstrated poor hemodynamics and hemolysis and was discontinued. Bjork-Shiley in 1969 developed a tilting-disc valve, which overcame the problems with the single-disc valve. Free rotation of disc between metal struts allows it to open by tilting at a 60-degree angle. Bjork-Shiley replaced the flat with the convexo-concave disc to create a larger orifice in 1975 but were the object of a recall due to fracture of welded struts.[22]  Medtronic Hall valve developed by Dr. Karl Hall and Robert Kaster is the most common tilting disc valve. Perforation in the middle of the disc served as a guide and an improved tilting angle.[23] In 1977, St Jude Medical developed Bi-leaflet valve, which comprised two semi-circular flaps with hinges close to the center of the orifice. Stagnation of blood flow leading to thrombus formation around the hinge region was a problem with the bi-leaflet valve.[15] A newly developed valve resolved this issue with a valve in which the continuous 360-degree rotation around the central axis of the valve ensured an even distribution of blood flow and prevent thrombus formation.[16]  Predisposition for thrombosis, embolism, need for lifelong anticoagulation therapy are drawbacks of mechanical valves. Bioprosthetic valves can either be an allograft (cadaver or Ross procedure) or, a xenograft (native or pericardium). The Ross procedure involves replacing the diseased aortic valve with the patient’s own pulmonary valve (autograft) and replace the pulmonary valve with aortic or pulmonary allograft. The pulmonary autograft grows with the patient and does not induce an immunologic response. The most common xenografts are porcine aortic valves and bovine pericardial valves. Lonescu-Shiley developed xenograft valves by using bovine pericardium on a titanium stent in 1971 but was later withdrawn in 1987 due to structural failure including abrasive tears because of fabric-tissue interface and leaflet calcification. Carpentier-Edwards bovine pericardial valve overcame those issues by making some structural modifications, like stitching pericardium to the inside of the fabric and using flexible stent posts. Although biological valves have better hemodynamics compared to mechanical valves, they have a shorter lifespan because of calcification, which stiffens the valve leaflets. Tissues engineering, a field in regenerative medicine restores and maintains the function of living tissues. Skin graft for burn victims is an example. Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) are perceived to be non-thrombogenic, and infection resistant. With advancement in material science and culturing techniques, there is the possibility of a TEHV valve that is capable of growing, remodeling and repairing itself as the patients grow. Polymeric valves have been around for over 50 years, but because the earlier versions were prone to calcification and degradation, they were not widely used and instead only used in bridge devices like artificial hearts and left ventricular assist devices. Besides the advantage that they can be produced in various shapes and sizes,[17] they are known to combine the durability of mechanical valves and the hydrodynamic function of bioprosthetic valves.[18] The earliest polymeric valve implanted in a 44-year-old female in 1958 at the mitral position was a polyurethane design with Teflon chordae tendinae.[18][24] Polyurethane valves have been found to have better hemodynamics compared to bioprosthetic valves and a lower incidence of thrombogenicity than mechanical valves. With advances in material sciences, the future of polymeric valves seems promising.",

On the contrary, a bicuspid aortic valve can also occur with normal function throughout life and never need treatment. Numerous genetic mechanisms are involved in the abnormal cellular functions that may cause abnormal development of the aortic valve during early foetal life. As several chromosomal disorders are also associated with a bicuspid valve, there does not appear to be an apparent common trigger to the abnormal development of the aortic valve. The clinical care of the bicuspid aortic valve patient has been changed by a significant body of evidence that has improved the understanding of the natural history of the disease, including when to best intervene with valve replacement and when to provide prophylactic aortic root surgery.

917,GARD:0001496,Congenital mitral stenosis,30725821,['Review'],Aortic Valve Replacement,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30725821,"The aortic valve is a semilunar valve with three leaflets, which lies at the junction of left ventricle and aorta. It allows unidirectional blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. Because of the highly complex and sophisticated cellular and molecular functions, the thin valve leaflet can withstand extreme mechanical and hemodynamic forces with every cardiac cycle.[1] Various factors including age and congenital defects can compromise the normal valvular function leading to a wide variety of complications.[2] Although bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are the most common congenital abnormality, congenital valve defects can range from aortic atresia (missing or incomplete closure of aortic valves) to a sub or supra-valvular stenosis. BAV is reported to have an incidence of 1 to 2% with a male predominance. Lack of microfibrillar proteins during valvulogenesis has been reported to affect the leaflet development where two leaflets are fused to form one large leaflet. It frequently correlates with aortic abnormalities such as aortic dilation (root, ascending and arch) and coarctation of the aorta.[3] The bicuspid aortic valve leaflets can undergo accelerated calcific degeneration because of abnormal hemodynamic forces. Congenital abnormalities including BAV can lead to various valvular complications including aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation leading to an increased risk to infective endocarditis, which has a reported incidence of 12 to 39% in BAV.[3] Unless severe, BAV generally remains asymptomatic till the age of 50 to 60 years. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a narrowing of the valve aperture reducing the aortic valve area. Increased resistance to blood flow and transvalvular pressure gradient causes increased left ventricle workload causing hypertrophy. Its prevalence increases with age and can be as high as 4.6% in people greater than age 75 years. Being the most common valvular disease in Europe and America, estimates are that 3.5 million people in England alone will have AS by the year 2020.[4] Calcific degeneration leading to stiffening and restriction motion of valve leaflet is the most common cause of AS. Disruption of endothelium lining on the aortic side caused by increased mechanical stress seem to be the inciting event. Posterior leaflets are reported to be affected the most.[5] Rheumatic fever causing inflammation of the leaflets is still the leading cause of AS in developing countries. AS can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms of syncope, angina and heart failure.[6] Severe AS is fatal with a 50% mortality at 2 years.[7] As per The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, AS is graded severe when the orifice area is less than 1.0 cm, the mean gradient is greater than 40 mmHg or the jet velocity is greater than 4 m/s. Prognosis is poor in symptomatic or severe cases unless the valve is replaced. Up to 30% of patients aged > 75 do not undergo surgical valve replacement either because of technical reasons; this may include porcelain aorta, general frailty, refusal to undergo surgery, and serious comorbid conditions.[8] The operative death risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is as high as 10% in patients with LV dysfunction, chronic renal disease, and advanced age.[9] Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR/TAVI) have emerged as a more feasible and less risky option for patients not suitable for surgery. Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle when the valve leaflets fail to coapt. Common causes include congenital defects, calcific degeneration, infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever, and trauma.[10][11][12][13] Ventricular hypertrophy in chronic cases accommodates increased volume to maintain the normal stroke volume and end-diastolic pressure; hence, chronic AR can be asymptomatic for decades.[14] In contrast, with acute cases of AR, ventricles do not have enough time to undergo the needed changes such as hypertrophy to accommodate increased volumes. Because of decreased stroke volume, the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output but is insufficient to meet the demand resulting in increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. On physical examination, AR murmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after the aortic component of S (A); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal intercostal space. It also has associations with various other murmurs including: “Mid-systolic murmur” because of rapid ejection of an overload of blood from the left ventricle, “Austin Flint” murmur is mid-to-late diastolic murmur due to partial closure of mitral valve during ventricular systole because of regurgitant flow from aortic valve, “Cole-Cecil” is a diastolic murmur due to the fusion of an aortic murmur with the S3 because of simultaneous filling of the left ventricle from left atrium and AR. History of valvular surgery Dr. Theodore Tuffier, in 1912, used his finger to free the fused leaflets of a stenosed aortic valve.[15] Before the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mitral valve repair involved commissurotomy through access from the left atrial chamber. Thomas Homes Sellors performed first pulmonary valvulotomy in 1948 by using a tenotomy knife.[16] Charles Hufnagel developed the first artificial valve based on a reciprocating ball and cage. It was used to prevent backflow of blood into the ventricles due to aortic insufficiency.[17] CPB machine revolutionized the valve replacement in the anatomical position. Dr. Dwight Harken and his colleagues performed the first successful aortic valve replacement. Later that year, Drs. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards performed mitral valve replacement.[18] Bioprosthetic valves are closer in function to natural valves but have a limited life expectancy, whereas, Mechanical valves are more durable but require anticoagulation. The choice of valves, among other factors, depends upon the patient’s age and well-being. Mechanical heart valves are known to last for approximately 25 years. Seventy different mechanical heart valves have been developed since 1960.[19] Ball and cage, bi-leaflet, and tilting disc are the common ones. Modification of the ball valve by Dr. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards entailed developing a cage made of lucite with a silicone elastomer ball. The cage material was later changed to stainless steel and then cobalt-chromium alloys. The Starr-Edward valve also has a Teflon sewing ring, which enabled suturing into mitral and later into the aortic position.[20]  Increased thrombogenicity has been a significant issue, for which valves underwent several modifications such as measures to reduce metal contact by covering the struts with cloth and using Silastic shields. Other issues included hemolysis due to excessive rubbing of the ball against the sewing ring and occlusion of coronary ostia because of high profile. Despite these issues, these valves showed the feasibility of prosthetic valve enabling Starr-Edwards to draw design criteria. Basic points included that the valves should be chemically inert, biocompatible, a-traumatic to blood, and non-thrombogenic.[21]  In 1965, Kay-Shiley’s non-rotating disc valve replaced the ball with a single disc but demonstrated poor hemodynamics and hemolysis and was discontinued. Bjork-Shiley in 1969 developed a tilting-disc valve, which overcame the problems with the single-disc valve. Free rotation of disc between metal struts allows it to open by tilting at a 60-degree angle. Bjork-Shiley replaced the flat with the convexo-concave disc to create a larger orifice in 1975 but were the object of a recall due to fracture of welded struts.[22]  Medtronic Hall valve developed by Dr. Karl Hall and Robert Kaster is the most common tilting disc valve. Perforation in the middle of the disc served as a guide and an improved tilting angle.[23] In 1977, St Jude Medical developed Bi-leaflet valve, which comprised two semi-circular flaps with hinges close to the center of the orifice. Stagnation of blood flow leading to thrombus formation around the hinge region was a problem with the bi-leaflet valve.[15] A newly developed valve resolved this issue with a valve in which the continuous 360-degree rotation around the central axis of the valve ensured an even distribution of blood flow and prevent thrombus formation.[16]  Predisposition for thrombosis, embolism, need for lifelong anticoagulation therapy are drawbacks of mechanical valves. Bioprosthetic valves can either be an allograft (cadaver or Ross procedure) or, a xenograft (native or pericardium). The Ross procedure involves replacing the diseased aortic valve with the patient’s own pulmonary valve (autograft) and replace the pulmonary valve with aortic or pulmonary allograft. The pulmonary autograft grows with the patient and does not induce an immunologic response. The most common xenografts are porcine aortic valves and bovine pericardial valves. Lonescu-Shiley developed xenograft valves by using bovine pericardium on a titanium stent in 1971 but was later withdrawn in 1987 due to structural failure including abrasive tears because of fabric-tissue interface and leaflet calcification. Carpentier-Edwards bovine pericardial valve overcame those issues by making some structural modifications, like stitching pericardium to the inside of the fabric and using flexible stent posts. Although biological valves have better hemodynamics compared to mechanical valves, they have a shorter lifespan because of calcification, which stiffens the valve leaflets. Tissues engineering, a field in regenerative medicine restores and maintains the function of living tissues. Skin graft for burn victims is an example. Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) are perceived to be non-thrombogenic, and infection resistant. With advancement in material science and culturing techniques, there is the possibility of a TEHV valve that is capable of growing, remodeling and repairing itself as the patients grow. Polymeric valves have been around for over 50 years, but because the earlier versions were prone to calcification and degradation, they were not widely used and instead only used in bridge devices like artificial hearts and left ventricular assist devices. Besides the advantage that they can be produced in various shapes and sizes,[17] they are known to combine the durability of mechanical valves and the hydrodynamic function of bioprosthetic valves.[18] The earliest polymeric valve implanted in a 44-year-old female in 1958 at the mitral position was a polyurethane design with Teflon chordae tendinae.[18][24] Polyurethane valves have been found to have better hemodynamics compared to bioprosthetic valves and a lower incidence of thrombogenicity than mechanical valves. With advances in material sciences, the future of polymeric valves seems promising.",

On the contrary, a bicuspid aortic valve can also occur with normal function throughout life and never need treatment. Numerous genetic mechanisms are involved in the abnormal cellular functions that may cause abnormal development of the aortic valve during early foetal life. As several chromosomal disorders are also associated with a bicuspid valve, there does not appear to be an apparent common trigger to the abnormal development of the aortic valve. The clinical care of the bicuspid aortic valve patient has been changed by a significant body of evidence that has improved the understanding of the natural history of the disease, including when to best intervene with valve replacement and when to provide prophylactic aortic root surgery. Moreover, as bicuspid valve disease is also part of various syndromes, we can identify high-risk patients in whom a bicuspid valve is much more unfavourable than in the normal population. This review provides an overview of all aspects of the bicuspid aortic valve condition and gives an updated perspective on issues from pathophysiology to clinical care of bicuspid aortic valve disease and associated aortic disease in asymptomatic, symptomatic, and pregnant patients, as well as our viewpoint on population screening.",

In most cases, there is a membrane (usually muscular) just below the aortic valve which causes a fixed obstruction to the blood flow across the left ventricular outflow tract. Despite being classified as a congenital heart defect, the fact that it is rare at birth and infancy, its gradual course and its high rate of postoperative recurrence propose that it may be an acquired defect. Anatomy The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve along with the intravalvular fibrosa form the posterolateral border and the muscular and membranous portions of the intraventricular septum form the anteromedial borders of the left ventricular outflow tract. Anatomic Variants There is a spectrum of variants of subvalvular aortic stenosis that occurs alone or in combination with the others. These are as follows: 1. A thin discrete membrane: The most common lesion. 2. A fibromuscular ridge  3. A diffuse fibromuscular tunnel-like narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract  (LVOT)[1],[2]. 4. Accessory or anomalous mitral valve tissue. In most patients, membrane attached to the ventricular septum or encompassing the left ventricular outflow tract causes the obstruction.[3],[4],[5]. Its position is anywhere from immediately below the aortic valve to further down into the left ventricle. The base of the aortic valve leaflets is noted to be involved by this subaortic tissue thus restricting the mobility and adding to the left ventricular outflow tract. Natural History As mentioned previously, the course of subvalvular aortic stenosis is gradual. It is rarely an isolated presentation. SAS is associated with congenital heart defects including a ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, bicuspid aortic valve, abnormal left ventricular papillary muscle, atrioventricular septal defect, among others. In the majority of the patients, SAS is incidentally found when evaluating patients for other congenital heart defects.",

Imaging, primarily transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of adults with subvalvar aortic stenosis.Most systematic research on imaging of subvalvar aortic stenosis has focused on echocardiography. TTE, especially two-dimensional imaging with color and spectral Doppler, remains the main modality for delineation of the anatomic and hemodynamic features of subvalvar stenosis, associated anomalies and involvement of accessory mitral valve attachments to the subaortic septum or abnormally placed papillary muscles. Transesophageal echocardiography may provide more detailed definition of left ventricular outflow tract anatomy, including the presence and extension of the obstructive subaortic fibroelastic tissue onto the aortic or mitral valve, especially in patients with poor transthoracic windows. The clinical role for advanced imaging technologies, including three-dimensional echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography, is evolving but, largely because of the adequacy of established imaging with TTE, remains relatively limited.In the absence of other congenital heart defects or alternative indications (e.g. coronary angiography), TTE is usually adequate for the assessment of discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis in the adult.

The project was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Haffkine Institute. Between December 2012 and September 2013, blood samples were collected from individuals of age 18-23 years after obtaining written informed consent from them. The quantitative determination of IgG antibodies in serum specimens against MMR was determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Data on history of vaccination were also collected from participants. Among 192 healthy college students (age 18-23 years), MMR seroprevalence was 91%, 97%, and 88%, respectively. The overall seropositivity of MMR was 79%. The highest level of seronegativity was seen with regards to rubella-specific antibodies in 12% of cases. About 96% of the participants did not know about their vaccination history while none of the participants knew about their history of MMR infections.

Cytomegalovirus is now a more common cause of handicap than rubella but no vaccine has been developed. Although antiviral drugs are available for herpes simplex virus and vaccinia, infection mortality in the newborn is high, even following the use of these agents; many HSV infections in the newborn arise following primary and asymptomatic maternal infections so that treatment may start late in the course of the illness.

There may be warning signs which require action, such as herpetic lesions in the genital tract of the mother. Less specific abnormalities during pregnancy, such as intra-uterine growth retardation and spontaneous onset of preterm labour, may point to congenital infection. This chapter describes both antenatal and postnatal management of the major congenital infections. We have included recent research data that should influence clinical practice; studies on HSV which suggest that, for women with a history of recurrent infection, routine viral culture of the genital tract at the end of pregnancy is unnecessary; reports from both the USA and the UK that rubella immunization performed inadvertently during early pregnancy has not resulted in the congenital rubella syndrome.

The majority of individuals with ARPKD present in the neonatal period with enlarged echogenic kidneys. Renal disease is characterized by nephromegaly, hypertension, and varying degrees of renal dysfunction. More than 50% of affected individuals with ARPKD progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within the first decade of life; ESRD may require kidney transplantation. Pulmonary hypoplasia resulting from oligohydramnios occurs in a number of affected infants. Approximately 30% of these infants die in the neonatal period or within the first year of life from respiratory insufficiency or superimposed pulmonary infections. With neonatal respiratory support and renal replacement therapies, the long-term survival of these infants has improved to greater than 80%. As advances in renal replacement therapy and kidney transplantation improve long-term survival, it is likely that clinical hepatobiliary disease will become a major feature of the natural history of ARPKD. In addition, a subset of individuals with this disorder are identified with hepatosplenomegaly; the renal disease is often mild and may be discovered incidentally during imaging studies of the abdomen. Approximately 50% of infants will have clinical evidence of liver involvement at diagnosis although histologic hepatic fibrosis is invariably present at birth. This can lead to progressive portal hypertension with resulting esophageal or gastric varices, enlarged hemorrhoids, splenomegaly, hypersplenism, protein-losing enteropathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Other hepatic findings include nonobstructed dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli syndrome) and dilatation of the common bile duct, which may lead to recurrent or persistent bacterial ascending cholangitis due to dilated bile ducts and stagnant bile flow. An increasing number of affected individuals surviving the neonatal period will eventually require portosystemic shunting or liver transplantation for complications of portal hypertension or cholangitis. The classic neonatal presentation of ARPKD notwithstanding, there is significant variability in age and presenting clinical symptoms related to the relative degree of renal and biliary abnormalities. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The suspicion of a diagnosis of ARPKD is based on clinical findings in the proband and the absence of renal disease in the proband's biological parents. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in PKHD1 in the affected individual establishes the diagnosis ARPKD. A recent study indicates that DZIP1L may be a second gene associated with ARPKD; more evidence will be required for this to be definitively proven. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Management of affected neonates centers on stabilization of respiratory function by mechanical ventilation and (rarely) unilateral or bilateral nephrectomy if massive kidney enlargement impairs diaphragmatic excursion. Neonates with oliguria or anuria may require peritoneal dialysis within the first days of life, and early recognition and treatment of dehydration and hypertension is critical. Affected children with significant chronic kidney disease should be treated with all modalities of modern pediatric ESRD therapy. Treatment of biliary dysfunction focuses on (1) malabsorption of nutrients and fat-soluble vitamins and (2) the risk for ascending cholangitis, and includes administration of synthetic bile acids and early recognition and treatment of ascending cholangitis. In those with progressive portal hypertension, endoscopy with sclerotherapy or banding of varices may be required. Portosystemic shunting and/or consideration of liver transplantation may be required. Those with ESRD and severe portal hypertension may be candidates for dual renal/liver transplantation. Prevention of secondary complications: Ursodiol treatment may increase the amount of bile acid and/or reduce the development of gallstones. Immunization against encapsulated bacteria in those with severe portal hypertension and splenic dysfunction is recommended. Palivizumab (Synagis®) for children younger than age 24 months with chronic lung disease and/or prematurity is recommended. Prophylaxis with antibiotics is recommended for those at high risk of developing ascending cholangitis. Surveillance: Regular monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, serum electrolyte concentrations, hydration status, nutritional status, and growth. Hepatobiliary dysfunction leading to portal hypertension is monitored by physical examination evaluating for hepatosplenomagly; regular examination of platelet count, in addition to serum albumin levels, PT/PTT, and 25-OH vitamin D, vitamin E levels, and fat-soluble vitamin levels. Periodic ultrasonography and referral to a hepatologist if hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly develops; periodic monitoring by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to detect esophageal varices. Consideration of MR cholangiography, a more sensitive measurement for biliary ectasia, at baseline and then as indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sympathomimetic agents in individuals with hypertension; nephrotoxic agents (NSAIDS and aminoglycosides) unless clinically indicated. Potentially hepatotoxic agents (e.g., acetaminophen doses of >30 mg/kg/day, herbal supplements, and alcohol) should be minimized. Preclinical data suggest that caffeine, theophylline-like medications, and calcium channel blockers should be avoided unless clinically necessary. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, high-resolution renal and hepatic ultrasonographic evaluation and monitoring of systemic blood pressure may identify disease in sibs of a proband. GENETIC COUNSELING:ARPKD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of a proband has a 25% chance of inheriting both pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of inheriting a pathogenic variant and being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither pathogenic variant and not being a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both pathogenic variants have been identified in the family. No systematic data are available on the sensitivity and specificity of prenatal ultrasound examination in establishing the diagnosis of ARPKD in pregnancies at 25% risk.",

Primary pulmonary hypoplasia occurring in an adult is extremely rare and we present what is probably the first case of a link to a tuberculous pleural effusion in a young woman after childbirth. PATIENT CONCERNS:Herein, we describe a 31-year-old woman with left lung hypoplasia, and she not only survived to adulthood without problems, but was able to deliver a baby in natural labor. DIAGNOSES:Left lung hypoplasia, right tuberculous pleural effusion. INTERVENTIONS:We initiated an anti-tuberculosis treatment for this patient with dose adjustments to her weight of isoniazid (0.3 g/day), rifampicin (0.45 g/day), pyrazinamide (1.5 g/day), and ethambutol (0.75 g/day) for 2 months then isoniazid and rifampicin for another 4 months. OUTCOMES:Ten days later after beginning therapy, she became afebrile and the pleural effusion resolved. No recurrence was observed during a 6-month follow-up period. LESSONS:In clinical practice, if one sees a chest x-ray revealing complete or incomplete opacification of a hemithorax with volume loss and history of repeated respiratory infections, one should consider the possibility of unilateral pulmonary hypoplasia. In such cases, regular close follow-up is important to minimize infections and to prevent development of cor pulmonale or respiratory failure.",

Both pregnancies were terminated and tracheal atresia was confirmed. In 15 foetuses the antenatal ultrasound appearance was of a unilateral ""bright"" echogenic lung. There was one case of bronchial atresia and two cases of congenital lobar emphysema, which all had surgery. In nine cases there was a reduction in the size of the lesion on serial antenatal ultrasounds and no lesion was detected after birth. In three cases a small lesion was present after birth on chest radiography. In six foetuses the antenatal ultrasound appearance was of unilateral cystic or mixed cystic and echogenic lung lesions.

However, due to the poor response that CSWS often have to antiepileptic drugs, non-pharmacologic treatment options are an important part of a comprehensive treatment plan for this group of children. This article discusses the use of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation, and epilepsy surgery in the treatment of patients with epileptic syndromes with CSWS.Treatment of ESES extends beyond just control of the seizures; amelioration of the continuous epileptiform discharge must occur to improve neuropsychological outcome. There is a significant correlation between the length of the ESES period and the extent of residual intellectual deficit at follow-up.

Epilepsy is a major clinical feature of this disorder. We describe the clinical presentation, evolution of epilepsy and explore the biological underpinnings of epileptogenesis in Menkes disease. METHODS:Longitudinal case study illustrating the natural history of epilepsy and results of subcutaneous cupric chloride supplementation in a patient with Menkes disease and literature review. RESULTS:The onset and evolution of epilepsy in Menkes disease is marked by different stages. Early presentations typically involve focal seizures, with progression to epileptic spasms and a chronic late stage of epilepsy characterized by tonic seizures, myoclonic jerks, and multifocal epileptiform activity on the EEG. Morphological correlates in the brain include evidence of atrophy of grey matter, ventriculomegaly, tortuous intracranial vasculature, and white matter signal changes consistent with loss of myelin and axons. The presence of significant lactic acidosis in brain and cerebrospinal fluid suggests widespread disturbance in oxidative metabolism. Molecular consequences of the pathogenic ATP7A gene mutation lead to impairment in copper transport, which in turn causes deficiencies of key copper containing enzymes (dopamine β hydroxylase and cytochrome c oxidase). Microarray studies suggest widespread effects in dysregulation of genes involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress, ribosomal translation, signal transduction, mitochondrial function, and immune responses. Impairment of copper mediated NMDA receptor function further enhances neuronal excitability, excitotoxic neuronal injury, setting up a cascade that creates conditions for epileptogenesis to follow. CONCLUSION:Neurological manifestations are likely related to perturbations in copper dependent enzymatic pathways involved in neurotransmitter and energy metabolism. Early diagnosis and institution of copper supplementation has been shown to be beneficial particularly in patients with residual ATP7A activity.",

Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20 years. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33.

Some reports in the literature cite that up to half of the clinical shoulder complaints are handled in a single visit by a primary care provider.[1] Rotator cuff pathologies are one common source of shoulder complaints. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles and their associated tendons: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis.[2][3][3][3] Rotator cuff dysfunction is a common source of pain and disability in multiple patient populations.[4] Traditional thinking regarding rotator cuff injuries places patients on a continuum toward eventual rotator cuff failure and varying degrees of partial- to full-thickness tear patterns. The natural history, as described by Neer, was that the rotator cuff would come in contact with a pathologic acromial undersurface during certain motions.[4] The original thinking was that this is impingement phenomenon was the inciting event that would cause the eventual cascade of rotator cuff pathologies. Neer's description was the mainstay of impingement shoulder theory for years to come.[5] According to Neer, the supraspinatus would then undergo a predictable breakdown in three stages: edema and hemorrhage, fibrosis and tendonitis, and eventual tendon rupture.[6] More recent thinking and research have added continued complexity to Neer's theory, and there is research to call into question the validity of that pathway. Moreover, the evolution of Neer's theory has developed into a broader classification of rotator cuff syndrome and pathologies, including internal versus external impingement mechanisms.[7][4]",

BACKGROUND:SCAD is an uncommon yet important cause of myocardial infarction in women. Very little is known about the characteristics of healing of dissected arteries. METHODS:Patients with nonatherosclerotic SCAD followed prospectively at Vancouver General Hospital who underwent repeat angiography were included in this study. Those who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for SCAD were excluded. Baseline patient demographics and in-hospital and long-term cardiovascular events were recorded. Angiographic characteristics of the SCAD artery at index and repeat angiography were assessed by 2 experienced angiographers. Criteria for angiographic healing were as follows: 1) improvement of stenosis severity from index event; 2) residual stenosis <50%; and 3) TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade 3. RESULTS:One hundred fifty-six patients with 182 noncontiguous SCAD lesions were included. The mean age was 51.5 ± 8.7 years, 88.5% were women, 83.3% were Caucasian, and 75.6% had fibromuscular dysplasia. All patients presented with myocardial infarction. At index angiography, type 2 SCAD was most commonly observed, in 126 of 182 lesions (69.2%); TIMI flow grade <3 was present in 85 of 182 (46.7%); and median lesion stenosis was 79.0% (interquartile range: 56.0% to 100%). Median time to repeat angiography was 154 days (interquartile range: 70 to 604 days), with median residual lesion stenosis improving to 25.5% (interquartile range: 12.0 to 38.8 days), and TIMI flow grade <3 observed in 10 of 182 lesions (5.5%).

Study objectives were to (1) evaluate mechanisms of early SCAD evolution through serial angiographic analysis, and (2) determine predictors of early SCAD progression. METHODS AND RESULTS:Retrospective registry study of patients with SCAD managed with an initial conservative strategy (n=240). Patients who experienced significant SCAD progression within 14 days, defined as clinical worsening plus new critical coronary obstruction on repeat angiography, were compared with remaining controls. A total of 42 of 240 (17.5%) experienced significant SCAD progression after index conservative approach; 91% by day 6. Isolated intramural hematoma (IMH) at baseline (no intimal dissection) was observed more frequently in those experiencing progression compared with controls (69.1% versus 44.4%; P=0.004). Multivariable predictors of SCAD progression included lesion severity, multivessel involvement, and isolated IMH. To investigate mechanisms of SCAD evolution, all repeat angiograms ≤14 days were compared with corresponding baselines (n=82 patient angiogram pairs). Of those with isolated IMH at baseline, 20% developed intimal dissection at repeat study. IMH was associated with greater longitudinal lesion extension (11.5 versus 2.8 mm; P=0.01), worsening Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow (-0.8 versus 0.1; P=0.003), and a nonsignificant lower rate of angiographic improvement (20.0% versus 31.3%; P=0.16) compared with the group with baseline intimal dissection. Optical coherence tomography subgroup analysis (n=17) indicated intimo-medial thickness to be lowest at the midpoint of IMH. CONCLUSIONS:Conservatively managed SCAD carries a 1:6 hazard for serious deterioration within 6 days. The risk was higher in those with isolated IMH at baseline. IMH often precedes development of intimal dissection, which has implications for mechanisms of SCAD.",

Clinical recognition can be challenging, so echocardiography is often the means by which definitive diagnosis is made. The tricuspid valve and right ventricle are on the systemic arterial side of the ccTGA circulation, and are therefore subject to progressive functional deterioration. The natural history of ccTGA is also greatly influenced by the nature and severity of accompanying lesions, some of which require surgical repair. Some management strategies leave the right ventricle as the systemic arterial pump, but carry the risk of worsening heart failure.

The past decade has provided important insights into the natural history and typical patterns of presentation. However, there are also a number of unresolved controversies regarding the indications for surgery and the efficacy of that surgery. The purpose of this study was to review our surgical experience with AAOCA in 115 patients at a single institution.One hundred and fifteen patients have undergone surgical repair of AAOCA at our institution. There were 82 males and 33 females, and the median age at surgery was 16 years. Fifty-nine patients had preoperative symptoms of myocardial ischemia, including 56 with exertional chest pain or syncope and 3 sudden death events. Twenty-four patients had associated congenital heart defects. Seven patients had an associated myocardial bridge.Surgical repair was accomplished by unroofing of an intramural coronary in 86, reimplantation in 9, and pulmonary artery translocation in 20. There has been no early or late mortality. Fifty-seven (97%) of the 59 symptomatic patients have been free of any cardiac symptoms postoperatively. Two patients had recurrent symptoms and underwent reoperation (one had revision of the initial repair and one had repair of a myocardial bridge).Surgical repair of AAOCA can be safely performed and is highly efficacious in relieving symptoms of myocardial ischemia. The two ""surgical failures"" in this series had an anatomic basis and underscore the need to reassess both the proximal and distal anatomy in these patients.",

METHODS:Cases of fetal callosal anomalies were retrospectively classified as isolated or complex based on the presence of other structural or genetic anomalies. Longitudinal ultrasound studies were reviewed, and postnatal outcomes were retrieved for isolated cases. RESULTS:In 135 fetuses, those who first presented after 24 weeks' gestation were more likely to have ventriculomegaly (n = 58 of 68 [85%]) than those who presented before 24 weeks (n = 39 of 67 [58%]; P < .001). In 79 cases that had longitudinal follow-up, the mean increase in ventricular width was 0.6 mm/wk, without a significant difference between isolated and complex cases (mean ± SD, 0.6 ± 1.5 versus 0.6 ± 1.1 mm; P = .45). CONCLUSIONS:Callosal anomalies are associated with progressive ventriculomegaly on prenatal ultrasound imaging, without a difference between isolated and complex anomalies. This feature should be considered part of the disease spectrum. The consequence of progressive ventriculomegaly on the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome is still unknown, and further studies should be aimed at obtaining long-term follow-up of these cases.",

We report here the clinical phenotype and natural history of ten individuals with CMM carrying five different monoallelic DCC variants, including the missense variant p.(Trp273Arg), two duplications, one deletion and one deletion-insertion; all are novel and absent from databases. We re-evaluated the 15 known disease-associated DCC missense variants by determining minor allele frequency (MAF) and pathogenicity using four in silico tools combining previous pathogenicity scores and the ACMG/AMP standards and guidelines and classified them in three groups. Group I contains three DCC missense variants that are rather unlikely to be associated with a higher risk to CMM and/or ACC. The five variants in group II may represent susceptibility factors to altered midline crossing in the central nervous system. Group III includes seven variants absent in publically available databases and representing possible pathogenic alleles, with four predicted to have a severe impact on protein function. Based on this data and the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance present in heterozygous carriers of a DCC variant, classification and clinical interpretation of missense variants is challenging in the absence of evidence of pathogenicity originated from functional studies. Evaluation of missense variants by MAF and a weighted combination of several computational algorithms is recommended.",

Based on over 50 reported cases, FGS is associated with developmental delay (especially speech), hypotonia, postnatal onset relative macrocephaly, prominent forehead, frontal hair upsweep, telecanthus, or ocular hypertelorism, thin vermilion border of the upper lip, relatively short fingers with broad thumbs and halluces, persistent fetal fingertip pads, anal anomalies, and/or constipation. Major malformations are rare, and include pyloric stenosis, anal agenesis, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and congenital heart defects. Abnormal EEGs and seizures have been reported in almost 70% of patients. Brain MRI shows corpus callosum abnormalities associated with dilatation of lateral ventricles and, less frequently, periventricular nodular heterotopias, mild cerebellar defects, and reduced periventricular white matter. Chiari 1 malformation seems to be frequent.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study from a baseline of 18 years, including life table and Kaplan-Meier analysis for probability of death/transplant, arrhythmia, surgical or percutaneous intervention, and permanent pacemaker insertion. RESULTS: A total of 97 adults with transposition of the great arteries-atrial switch (Mustard procedure in 80/Senning procedure in 17) and 32 adults with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries survived. The median ages at latest follow-up were 29 and 34 years, respectively. At 40 years of follow-up, freedom from death or transplant was 0.90 for those with transposition of the great arteries-atrial switch and 0.84 for those with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (P = .833). Freedom from arrhythmia at 40 years of follow-up was 0.51 for those with transposition of the great arteries-atrial switch and 0.93 for those with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (P = .007). Freedom from intervention at 40 years of follow-up was 0.33 for those with transposition of the great arteries-atrial switch after initial repair and 0.53 for those with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (P = .938).

However, there is a substantial burden of atrial tachyarrhythmia, and this occurs significantly earlier in those with transposition of the great arteries-atrial switch.

RECENT FINDINGS:The natural history of PCA appears to be distinct from typical Alzheimer's disease and significant heterogeneity exists within the PCA syndrome, with the underlying causes of this heterogeneity beginning to be explored. Functional and molecular imaging can assist in better understanding PCA, particularly assessment of network disruptions that contribute to clinical phenotypes. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are useful to detect underlying pathology, but measures of retinal thickness are less promising. There are currently no adequate treatment options for PCA.

This study aims to investigate the causes and pregnancy outcomes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancies with platelet counts below 50 × 109/L. We retrospectively analyzed the pregnancies diagnosed with severe thrombocytopenia at a tertiary care center in western China between January 2009 and December 2017. All enrolled pregnancies were divided into three groups according to the lowest platelet counts: group A (30-50 × 109/L), group B (10-30 × 109/L), and group C (< 10 × 109/L). Maternal and fetal outcomes were observed and compared among these three platelet levels. A total of 533 consecutive pregnancies were included.

From the basic neurological examination at his first hospital visit, rigidity and myoclonic jerks in all limbs were observed without focal weakness. Electroencephalogram showed the diffuse slow continuous delta activity in the bilateral cerebral hemisphere. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormalities in the brain, such as cortical signal changes and edema in the frontotemporoparietal lobes and the basal ganglia. Cerebrospinal fluid 14-3-3 protein analysis showed a weakly positive signal. Family history remained unclear, but the patient's mother and sister were diagnosed with cognitive impairment but both refused genetic testing. Methods: Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 50 genes, involved in different neurodegeneratives diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, frontotemporal dementia or prion diseases. In silico analyses and structure predictions were performed on the potential patohgenic mutations. Results: NGS and standard sequencing revealed the novel PRNP p.Tyr225Cys mutation in the patient. Structure predictions revealed that this may make the helix more flexible. In addition, the extra cysteine residue in TM-III of prion protein may result in disturbances of natural disulfide bond. Conclusion: Hence, the pathogenicity of PRNP p.Tyr225Cys was not fully confirmed at present, and its penetrance was suggested to be low. However, its possible pathogenic nature in prion diseases cannot be ignored, since Tyr/Cys exchange could disturb the helix dynamics and contribute to conformational alteration and disease progression.",
966,GARD:0001550,Costello syndrome,20301680,"['Book', 'Review']",Costello Syndrome,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301680,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:While the majority of individuals with Costello syndrome share characteristic findings affecting multiple organ systems, the phenotypic spectrum is wide, ranging from a milder or attenuated phenotype to a severe phenotype with early lethal complications. Costello syndrome is typically characterized by failure to thrive in infancy as a result of severe postnatal feeding difficulties; short stature; developmental delay or intellectual disability; coarse facial features (full lips, large mouth, full nasal tip); curly or sparse, fine hair; loose, soft skin with deep palmar and plantar creases; papillomata of the face and perianal region; diffuse hypotonia and joint laxity with ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers; tight Achilles tendons; and cardiac involvement including: cardiac hypertrophy (usually typical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), congenital heart defect (usually valvar pulmonic stenosis), and arrhythmia (usually supraventricular tachycardia, especially chaotic atrial rhythm/multifocal atrial tachycardia or ectopic atrial tachycardia). Relative or absolute macrocephaly is typical, and postnatal cerebellar overgrowth can result in the development of a Chiari I malformation with associated anomalies including hydrocephalus or syringomyelia. Individuals with Costello syndrome have an approximately 15% lifetime risk for malignant tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma in young children and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in adolescents and young adults. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:The diagnosis of Costello syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous HRAS pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Failure to thrive is the most common and challenging clinical problem; most infants require nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding; many require Nissen fundoplication. Treatment of cardiac manifestations and malignancy is routine. Ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers often requires early bracing and occupational and/or physical therapy; tight Achilles tendons may require surgical tendon lengthening. Developmental disability requires early-intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Recurrent facial papillomata may require routine removal with dry ice. Hemodynamically significant valvar stenoses require antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis; anesthesia may pose a risk to those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or those predisposed to some types of atrial tachycardia. Surveillance: Monitoring for neonatal hypoglycemia; echocardiography with electrocardiogram at diagnosis with subsequent follow up by a cardiologist who is aware of the spectrum of cardiac disease and its natural history; abdominal and pelvic ultrasound examinations to screen for rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma every three to six months until age eight to ten years may be considered; annual urinalysis for evidence of hematuria to screen for bladder cancer beginning at age ten years. GENETIC COUNSELING:Costello syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands with Costello syndrome have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; although parents of probands are not affected, vertical transmission has been reported in two families with the rare, attenuated phenotype. Because Costello syndrome is typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of a proband is presumed to be small; however, recurrence in sibs has been reported and is suspected to be the result of germline mosaicism in a parent. Individuals with Costello syndrome typically do not reproduce. Once an HRAS pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

We collected height, weight, and head circumference (OFC) measurements from 94 individuals (45 males and 49 females). Their HRAS mutation spectrum reflects previously published cohorts, with p.G12S in 77.7%. Participants received medical care, therefore our data does not reflect natural history per se, but rather growth with nutritional support. Due to limited cohort size, we analyzed data from males and females together. Weight-for-age data included 417 separate measurements from 80 individuals age 0-36 months, and 585 measurements from 82 individuals for age 0-10 years. Height-for-age data were derived from 391 measurements from 77 individuals age 0-36 months, and 591 measurements from 90 individuals age 0-10 years. Measurements obtained after growth hormone exposure in 15 individuals were excluded in this analysis. The OFC curve was derived from 221 measurements from 55 individuals age 0-36 months. Centiles (5th, 50th, and 95th) were estimated across the age continuum for each growth parameter, and compared to gender-specific curves for average stature individuals. The resulting curves demonstrate very slow weight gain in the first 2 years. Short stature is seen in many, but after age 4 years the 95th centile for height falls within the low normal range for average stature children. Head circumference curves largely overlap those for average stature, reflecting relative macrocephaly.",

It causes diffuse periosteal new bone formation on the long bones, with a predilection for the appendicular skeleton. When acquired, it is a nonspecific indicator of systemic disease that arises following a primary condition. This paper reviews the palaeopathological literature associated with this rare condition. It also describes the first possible case of co-morbidity associated with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in an adult skeleton (cal. BC 170 - 1 cal. AD) from the mobile pastoralist Sarmatian culture of the Volga steppes of Russia. METHODS:Macroscopic and radiological examination provide differential diagnoses of the lesions, while clinical and bioarchaeological analyses offer insights into the possible experience of disease and social implications of care among the nomadic populations of Iron Age Russia. RESULTS:The analysis of Sk. 6524.102 displays lesions that may be due to both hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and osteomalacia. The man was physically impaired and his participation in physically challenging activities would have been limited. CONCLUSIONS:The study stresses that co-morbidity is a key parameter when interpreting disease in past populations, particularly when the diagnosis involves hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. SIGNIFICANCE:This is the first case of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy identified in Eurasian prehistoric populations. The research emphasises the significance of co-morbidity in the past. LIMITATIONS:The diagnosis of co-morbid diseases in human remains is extremely complex and the conditions were identified as most probable by a process of elimination.

English-language articles from 1966 to the present were identified through a search of the MEDLINE database by using the terms Eisenmenger, congenital heart disease, and pulmonary hypertension. Selected cross-referenced articles were also included. Articles on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, natural history, complications, and treatment of the Eisenmenger syndrome in adults were selected, and descriptive and analytical data relevant to the practicing physician were manually extracted. The Eisenmenger syndrome is characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and right-to-left shunting of blood through a systemic-to-pulmonary circulation connection. Most patients with the syndrome survive for 20 to 30 years. The hemostatic changes associated with the syndrome may lead to thromboembolic events, cerebrovascular complications, or the hyperviscosity syndrome. Erythrocytosis is present in most patients, but excessive phlebotomy may cause microcytosis and exacerbate the symptoms of hyperviscosity. Other complications associated with the Eisenmenger syndrome include hemoptysis, gout, cholelithiasis, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, and decreased renal function. Pregnancy or noncardiac surgery is associated with a high mortality rate in patients with the Eisenmenger syndrome. Because most pediatric patients with the Eisenmenger syndrome survive to adulthood, primary care physicians should have a thorough understanding of the syndrome; its associated complications; and medical and surgical management, especially with regard to the appropriate timing of phlebotomy and lung or heart-lung transplantation. In addition, patients with the syndrome should undergo routine follow-up at a tertiary care center that has physicians and nurses with special expertise in congenital heart disease. In patients with the Eisenmenger syndrome who are pregnant or require noncardiac surgery, a multidisciplinary approach should be used to reduce the excessive mortality associated with these conditions.",

The landmark coordinates were analyzed for variation in size, shape, and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) using MorphoJ software, showing no effects on cranial size, on FA in females only (i.e., decreased asymmetry), and on shape in both sexes (i.e., decreased facial length and shift in the palatal suture). In the maxillary teeth, females in the highest dose group showed a significant decrease of 0.1 mm (p = 0.033) of the second molar only, whereas males in most dose groups showed average increases of 0.1 mm (p = 0.006-0.044) in all three molars. In the mandibular teeth, the only significant response to PCB 180 exposure was the average increase of 0.1 mm (p = 0.001-0.025) in the third molars of males only. Males also shower greater sensitivity in postcranial effects of increased tibial length and decreased cortical bone mass density, although only females showed significant effects on tibial bone area and thickness. These results demonstrate marked sex differences in effects of PCB 180, which can be attributed to differences in their underlying biological mechanisms of toxicity. Furthermore, although tooth and bone development are targets of both DL and NDL compounds, this study shows that there are marked differences in their mechanisms and effects.",

In HPP, inorganic pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralization and substrate for TNSALP, accumulates extracellularly often leading to rickets or osteomalacia and tooth loss, and sometimes to craniosynostosis and calcium crystal arthropathies. HPP's remarkably broad-ranging expressivity spans stillbirth from profound skeletal hypomineralization to adult-onset dental problems or arthropathies without bone disease, which is largely explained by autosomal recessive versus autosomal dominant transmission from among several hundred, usually missense, TNSALP mutations. For clinical purposes, this expressivity has been codified according to absence or presence of skeletal disease and then patient age at presentation and diagnosis. Pediatric patients are reported principally with ""odonto"", ""childhood"", ""infantile"", or ""perinatal"" HPP. However, this nosology has not been tested using a cohort of patients, and the ranges of the clinical and laboratory findings have not been defined and contrasted among these patient groups. To evaluate the extant nosology for HPP in children, we assessed our 25 years experience with 173 pediatric HPP patients. Data were exclusively from inpatient studies. The childhood form of HPP was further designated ""mild"" or ""severe"". Here, we focused on demographic, clinical, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry parameters compared to data from healthy American children. The 173-patient cohort comprised 64 individuals with odonto HPP, 38 with mild childhood HPP, 58 with severe childhood HPP, and 13 with infantile HPP. None was a survivor of perinatal HPP. TNSALP analysis revealed a mutation(s) in all 105 probands tested. Thirteen mutations were unique. Most patients represented autosomal dominant inheritance of HPP. Mutant allele dosage generally indicated the disorder's severity. Gender discordance was found for severe childhood HPP; 42 boys versus 16 girls (p=0.006), perhaps reflecting parental concern about stature and strength. Key disease parameters (e.g., height, weight, numbers of teeth lost prematurely, grip strength, spine and hip bone mineral density) were increasingly compromised as HPP was designated more severe. Although data overlapped successively between the four patient groups, body size (height and weight) differed significantly. Thus, our expanded nosology for HPP in children organizes the disorder's broad-ranging expressivity and should improve understanding of HPP presentation, natural history, complications, and prognosis.",

With complementary genetic information, more precise diagnosis and long-term functional outcome of cranial vault remodeling in affected patients can be studied, and additional distinct features of Muenke syndrome can now be investigated. This study was undertaken to assess craniofacial growth and long-term functional outcome in patients with Muenke-type craniosynostosis. METHODS: A chart review of all FGFR3 patients at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who had undergone cranial vault remodeling for unicoronal or bicoronal synostosis (n = 16) was performed. Need for reoperation, midface surgery, and functional corrections were assessed. Audiology and orthodontic records were reviewed. RESULTS: All patients underwent cranial remodeling during infancy. Repeated intracranial surgery was performed or is currently scheduled for aesthetic reasons only (n = 7). Sexual dimorphism with male preponderance in FGFR3 unicoronal synostosis was detected. Despite dental crowding amenable to palatal expansion in patients with bicoronal synostosis, significant midface hypoplasia was not observed. Sensorineural hearing loss with a distinctive pattern was present in all patients who had undergone audiology testing. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FGFR3-associated craniosynostosis demonstrate a sexual dimorphism, with a male preponderance for unicoronal synostosis. A secondary major intracranial procedure is required for recurrent supraorbital retrusion in at least 43 percent of patients. A secondary or tertiary extracranial forehead contouring procedure should be anticipated in nearly all patients. No patient required any midface correctional procedure. These patients demonstrate characteristic bilateral, symmetric, low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.",

Hookworms (Ancylostoma brasiliense, A. caninum) are the most common causative parasites. They live in the intestines of dogs and cats where their ova are deposited in the animal feces. In sandy and shady soil, when temperature and moisture are elevated, the ova hatch and mature into infective larva. Infection occurs when humans have contact with the infected soil. Infective larva penetrate the exposed skin of the body, commonly around the feet, hands and buttocks. In humans, the larva are not able to complete their natural cycle and remain trapped in the upper dermis of the skin. The disease is widespread in tropical or subtropical regions, especially along the coast on sandy beaches. The diagnosis is easy for the patient who is returning from a tropical or subtropical climate and gives a history of beach exposure. The characteristic skin lesion is a fissure or erythematous cord which is displaced a few millimeters each day in a serpiginous track. Scabies, the larva currens syndrome due to Strongyloides stercoralis, must be distinguished from other creeping eruptions and subcutaneous swelling lesions caused by other nematodes or myiasis. Medical treatments are justified because it shortens the duration of the natural evolution of the disease. Topical tiabendazole is safe for localized invasions, but prolonged treatment may be necessary. Oral thiabendazole treatment for three days is effective, but sometimes is associated with adverse effects. Trials using albendazole for one or four consecutive days appear more efficacious. More recent trials using ivermectine showed that a single oral dose can cure 100% of the patients; thus, this drug looks very promising as a new form of therapy. Individual prophylaxis consists of avoiding skin contact with soil which has been contaminated with dog or cat feces. Keeping dogs and cats off the beaches is illusory in tropical countries.",

METHODS:Forty-eight patients who underwent surgery and were diagnosed as FEVR in our department were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected including the demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients. FEVR patients were divided into 2 groups according to the diagnostic timing: FEVR diagnosed pre-operatively (23 patients), FEVR diagnosed intra-/post-operatively (25 patients). Multivariable analysis was applied for analyzing the risk factors for diagnostic timing. RESULTS:The clinical characteristics of the FEVR patients were of great variability, including retinal detachment (RD), disappear of anterior chamber, retrolental membrane, epiretinal membrane (ERM), vitreous hemorrhage (VH), myopic foveoschisis (MF), lamellar macular hole (LMH), high myopia (HM). And the referral diagnosis or pre-operative diagnosis were always non-specific. The majority of the referral or preoperative diagnosis were unilateral RD (52.1%), bilateral RD (8.3%), unilateral persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) (8.3%), bilateral PFV (4.2%). There are two risk factors for the complicated FEVR cases diagnosed as FEVR preoperatively: pre-operative ocular manifestations with RD only (OR, 0.104; p-value, 0.022), positive parent's fluorescein angiography (FA) (OR, 0.105; p-value, 0.035). CONCLUSIONS:The phenotypes of FEVR were greatly variable, they can mimic many non-specific vitreoretinal disorders. The most non-specific referral diagnosis/pre-operative diagnosis was unilateral RD, bilateral RD, unilateral PFV, bilateral PFV. A positive family history or a simple ocular presentation with RD only could contribute to diagnose FEVR preoperatively.",

Also, to evaluate affected patients for DNA abnormalities. METHODS: The records of thirty-nine patients with FEVR were studied. All were asked to come in for a final follow-up examination. The referring physician was asked to provide the latest findings for those who could not. On 10 patients, karyotypes were prepared. RESULTS: Only 2 of 28 patients whose onset of symptoms was prior to their third birthday had a final visual acuity of 20/200 or better. Older patients had a better prognosis, because they were more likely to have asymmetrical retinal deterioration with only one eye deteriorating. Preservation of good visual acuity into the teens and later was no guarantee that deterioration would not occur. In 3 eyes of 4 patients who were asymptomatic until 15 years of age, the final visual acuity was counting fingers or worse. In 5 patients, retinal detachment developed 6 to 17 years after apparent stabilization. The karyotype of 10 patients showed no evidence for rearrangement, altered size, translocations or deletions of chromosome 11 or any other chromosome. Of the 31 eyes in patients older than 15 years, 10 (32%) had a significant cataract. Three eyes underwent cataract surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for infants with FEVR is extremely poor and the long-term prognosis for patients with a later onset of the condition is guarded. Retinal detachment, macular dragging, and cataract are common late complications which can develop even in patients whose eye findings appear to be stable. Karyotype studies ruled out involvement of chromosome 11 or others at a gross level, but did not exclude them at the location for some genetic defect related to FEVR because single base changes and small deletions or insertions may be undetectable by the methods utilized.",

We compared these cases clinically and pathologically with 6 other pulmonary diseases, namely, bronchiolitis obliterans, BOOP, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, usual interstitial pneumonitis, airway-centered interstitial fibrosis, and idiopathic bronchiolocentric interstitial pneumonia, and with 10 cases of cystic fibrosis, an unrelated disease with both bronchiolar and interstitial pathology. The commonality of our cases was a combination of bronchiolitis and interstitial inflammation and fibrosis but little or no intra-alveolar organizing pneumonia. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia involved less area than the interstitial pneumonitis in each case.

Most of the Baylisascaris species have a similar life cycle with carnivorous mammals or marsupials serving as definitive hosts and a smaller prey host serving as paratenic (or intermediate) hosts. However, one species in rodents is unique in that it only has one host. Considerable research has been conducted on B. procyonis, the raccoon roundworm, as it is a well-known cause of severe to fatal neurologic disease in humans and many wildlife species. However, other Baylisascaris species could cause larva migrans but research on them is limited in comparison.

Heterozygous C-terminal mutations in NFKB2 have been associated with early-onset common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), central adrenal insufficiency and ectodermal dysplasia. Only two previously reported cases have documented decreased natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, and little is known about the role of NF-κB2 in NK cell maturation and function. Here we report a 13-year-old female that presented at 6 years of age with a history of early onset recurrent sinopulmonary infections, progressive hair loss, and hypogamaglobulinemia consistent with a clinical diagnosis of CVID. At 9 years of age she had cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia that responded to ganciclovir treatment. Functional NK cell testing demonstrated decreased NK cell cytotoxicity despite normal NK cell numbers, consistent with a greater susceptibility to systemic CMV infection. Research exome sequencing (ES) was performed and revealed a novel de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in NFKB2 (c.2611C>T, p.Gln871*) that was not carried by either of her parents. The variant was Sanger sequenced and confirmed to be de novo in the patient.

To our knowledge, this is the third NF-κB2 deficient patient in which an abnormal NK cell function has been observed, suggesting a role for non-canonical NF-κB2 signaling in NK cell cytotoxicity. NK cell function should be assessed in patients with mutations in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway to explore the risk for systemic viral infections that may lead to severe complications and impact patient survival. Similarly NF-κB2 should be considered in patients with combined immunodeficiency who have aberrant NK cell function. Further studies are needed to characterize the role of NF-κB2 in NK cell cytotoxic function.",

Further potential immune mediators have been identified. An autoantibody directed against a muscle antigen appears to have high specificity for IBM among muscle diseases. Further evidence for myonuclear degeneration has been reported. SUMMARY: IBM remains a poorly understood muscle disease, although understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms continues to expand and is supporting new therapeutic approaches.",

The hallmarks of the syndrome, represented in the DOOR acronym, include sensorineural hearing loss, hypoplastic or absent nails on the hands and feet, small or absent distal phalanges of the hands and feet, and mental retardation. The purpose of our communication is to report on an additional patient with DOOR syndrome, delineate common as well as less frequent manifestations of DOOR syndrome, bring attention to the under appreciated facial features in DOOR syndrome, document the natural history of this disorder, and propose a suggested workup of those suspected of DOOR syndrome. DOOR syndrome is associated with characteristic, coarse facial features with large nose with wide nasal bridge, bulbous tip and anteverted nares, a long prominent philtrum and downturned corners of the mouth. The natural history is one of a deteriorative course, with progressive neurological manifestations including sensorineural deafness, seizures from infancy, optic atrophy, and a peripheral polyneuropathy. The majority of patients with DOOR syndrome have elevated levels of 2-oxoglutarate in the urine and plasma. In this report, we present a newborn with manifestations consistent with DOOR syndrome and a progressive clinical course. A comprehensive literature review reveals 32 patients with DOOR syndrome. In conclusion, DOOR syndrome is a neurometabolic disorder with recognizable facial features and a progressive natural history.",

The effect of FD on hearing and otologic function has not been established. Objectives:To characterize audiologic and otologic manifestations in a large cohort of individuals with FD/MAS and to investigate potential mechanisms of hearing loss. Design, Setting, and Participants:In this natural history study, individuals with craniofacial FD seen at a clinical research center underwent clinical, biochemical, computed tomographic, audiologic, and otolaryngologic evaluations. Main Outcomes and Measures:Clinical and radiologic features associated with hearing loss and otologic disease were evaluated. Conductive hearing loss was hypothesized to be associated with narrowing of the external auditory canal (EAC), FD involving the epitympanum, and FD crowding the ossicular chain. Sensorineural hearing loss was hypothesized to be associated with FD affecting the internal auditory canal (IAC) and otic capsule. Results:Of the 130 study participants with craniofacial FD who were evaluated, 116 (89.2%) had FD that involved the temporal bone (median age, 19.6 years; range, 4.6-80.3 years; 64 female [55.2%]), whereas 14 (10.8%) had craniofacial FD that did not involve the temporal bone. Of the 183 ears with temporal bone FD, hearing loss was identified in 41 ears (22.4%) and was conductive in 27 (65.9%), sensorineural in 12 (29.3%), and mixed in 2 (4.9%). Hearing loss was mild and nonprogressive in most participants. Whereas EACs were narrower in ears with FD (mean difference [MD], 0.33 mm; 95% CI, 0.11-0.55 mm), this finding was associated with conductive hearing loss in only 4 participants. Fibrous dysplasia crowding of the ossicles was associated with conductive hearing loss (odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95% CI, 2.1-11.6). The IAC length was not different between ears with and without FD (MD, -0.37; 95% CI, -0.95 to 0.211); however, canals were elongated in ears with sensorineural hearing loss (MD, -1.33; 95% CI, -2.60 to -0.07). Otic capsule involvement was noted in only 4 participants, 2 of whom had sensorineural hearing loss. Both MAS-associated growth hormone excess (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.5) and neonatal hypercortisolism (OR, 11; 95% CI, 2.5-55) were associated with an increased risk of hearing loss . Conclusions and Relevance:Hearing loss in craniofacial FD is common and mild to moderate in most individuals. It typically arises from FD crowding of the ossicular chain and elongation of the IAC, whereas EAC stenosis and otic capsule invasion are less common causes. Individuals with craniofacial FD should undergo otolaryngologic evaluation and monitoring, including assessment to identify those with high-risk features.",

METHODS:Descriptive, cross-sectional observational design. The sample consisted of 50 patients diagnosed with WS. Clinical criteria contributing to WS diagnosis were analyzed: diabetes mellitus (DM), optic nerve atrophy (OA), sensorineural deafness, urological and neurological dysfunction, among others. These parameters were assessed according to their presence/absence, age of onset, and various clinical-analytical parameters. RESULTS:All the patients studied presented DM and OA, with a mean age of onset of 5.4 ± .9 (1-14) years and 9 ± .9 (1-16) years, respectively. The remaining criteria were present with a variable frequency: 77% had diabetes insipidus, 66.7% auditory alterations, 77.8% neurogenic bladder, 61.1% neurological involvement, and 27.8% hypogonadism. A 16.7% of the patients had positive albuminuria (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g) and 72.2% had hyporreflexia. There were no significant differences in the age of diagnosis nor of the presence of different pathologies according to sex. CONCLUSIONS:The early presence of a non-autoimmune insulin dependent DM, should alert us of an ""infrequent"" diabetes syndrome. Wolfram's presumptive diagnosis could be established if juvenile-onset DM occurs concomitantly with OA, and this visual impairment is not attributable to diabetic retinopathy. Despite the long period of evolution of DM and altered values of HbA1c, the prevalence of microvascular complications in the sample are low.",

All patients present from birth with macrothrombocytopenia, but in infancy or adult life, some of them develop sensorineural deafness, presenile cataracts, and/or progressive nephritis leading to end-stage renal failure. No consistent correlations have been identified between the 27 different MYH9 mutations identified so far and the variable clinical evolution of the disease. We have evaluated 108 consecutive MYH9-RD patients belonging to 50 unrelated pedigrees. The risk of noncongenital manifestations associated with different genotypes was estimated over time by event-free survival analysis. We demonstrated that all subjects with mutations in the motor domain of NMMHC-IIA present with severe thrombocytopenia and develop nephritis and deafness before the age of 40 years, while those with mutations in the tail domain have a much lower risk of noncongenital complications and significantly higher platelet counts. We also evaluated the clinical course of patients with mutations in the four most frequently affected residues of NMMHC-IIA (responsible for 70% of MYH9-RD cases). We concluded that mutations at residue 1933 do not induce kidney damage or cataracts and cause deafness only in the elderly, those in position 702 result in severe thrombocytopenia and produce nephritis and deafness at a juvenile age, while alterations at residue 1424 or 1841 result in intermediate clinical pictures.

CE was detected in 15/58 pre-treated patients; in contrast, none of 47 untreated patients developed CE (p < 0.0001). In two cases the appearance of 14q32/IGH translocation was first detected in the bone marrow (BM) or in the lymph node (LN) and 13-58 months later in the peripheral blood (PB). ZAP70 + and high-risk cytogenetics predicted for the occurrence of CE with borderline statistical significance (p = 0.055 and 0.07, respectively).

Intermediate histologies include tumors of both soft tissue and bone origin and are locally aggressive and rarely metastatic. Some common aspects to these tumors are that they can be locally infiltrative and/or impinge on critical organs, which leads to disfigurement, pain, loss of function and mobility, neurovascular compromise, and occasionally life-threatening consequences, such as mesenteric, bowel, ureteral, and/or bladder obstruction. DT, PVNS, and GCTB have few and recurrent molecular aberrations but, paradoxically, can have variable natural histories. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for optimal management. In DT and PVNS, a course of observation may be appropriate, and any intervention should be guided by symptoms and/or disease progression. A surgical approach should take into consideration the infiltrative nature, difficulty in obtaining wide margins, high recurrence rates, acute and chronic surgical morbidities, and impact on quality of life. There are similar concerns with radiation, which especially relate to optimal field and transformation to high-grade radiation-associated sarcomas. Systemic therapies must be considered carefully in light of acute and chronic toxicities. Although standard and novel therapies are promising, many unanswered questions, such as duration of therapy and optimal end points to evaluate efficacy of drugs in clinical practice and trials, exist.

PCD primarily effects the respiratory tract, yet most research focuses on the lower respiratory tract manifestations, most of which is derived from research on cystic fibrosis. Little is known about the management of the upper respiratory tract sequelae of PCD. This review summarizes the available evidence for the management of otologic and sinonasal manifestations of PCD. RECENT FINDINGS: The natural history of otitis media with effusion and hearing loss in PCD appears to fluctuate into adulthood and does not resolve by the age of 9 years, regardless of treatment, as previously assumed. Ventilation tube insertion improves hearing in PCD, but may lead to a higher rate of otorrhoea when compared with the general population. Sinonasal disease in PCD is poorly studied; however, it appears that patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) may benefit from long-term macrolide therapy and endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) in recalcitrant disease. Therapies targeted at improving mucociliary clearance have not been tested specifically in PCD. Pharmacogenetic therapy is currently under investigation to target the primary defect in PCD. SUMMARY: Otologic sequeale in PCD should undergo lifelong evaluation and monitoring and ventilation tube insertion should be considered to avoid complications of chronic hearing loss. Sinonasal disease benefits from macrolide therapy and ESS. Randomized controlled trials of treatment efficacy of the upper respiratory tract manifestations of PCD are lacking.",

Otolaryngologists are frequently involved in the management of some of the most common symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia including chronic rhinitis, sinusitis and otitis media with effusion. A dilemma for otorhinolaryngologists is whether ventilation tubes are of benefit in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia and otitis media with effusion and what effective alternatives exist. This paper aims to address this issue via a literature review and case presentation. METHODS: An extensive review of the literature was undertaken and a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of ventilation tubes in the management of otitis media with effusion in these children is presented and compared with that of the general population. We present a case of a 9 months old boy with Kartagener's Syndrome and chronic bilateral otitis media with effusion to illustrate our findings. RESULTS: Eight papers were identified, all with small study numbers. The main outcome measures were hearing, otorrhoea and tympanic membrane structural changes. The natural history of otitis media with effusion and hearing loss in primary ciliary dyskinesia appears to be fluctuant into adulthood. Therefore, otitis media with effusion in primary ciliary dyskinesia does not resolve by the age of 9 years, regardless of treatment, as previously assumed. Ventilation tube insertion improves hearing in primary ciliary dyskinesia, but may lead to a higher rate of otorrhoea when compared to the general population. Tympanic membrane changes were clinically insignificant. Our patient eventually underwent successful insertion of bilateral ventilation tubes with a marked improvement in hearing and language with minimal otorrhoea. CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION: The highest level of evidence found for the management of otitis media with effusion in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia was level IV. Currently, the evidence is inconclusive and conflicting. Whilst our results are promising, clearly higher quality research on a larger number of patients is required to definitively evaluate the management options for otitis media with effusion in these children.",

Factors that predict macrosomia are poorly understood. The increased rate of macrosomia in the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and in congenital hyperinsulinaemia is mediated by increased foetal insulin secretion. We assessed the in utero and neonatal role of two key regulators of pancreatic insulin secretion by studying birthweight and the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia in patients with heterozygous mutations in the maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes HNF4A (encoding HNF-4alpha) and HNF1A/TCF1 (encoding HNF-1alpha), and the effect of pancreatic deletion of Hnf4a on foetal and neonatal insulin secretion in mice. METHODS AND FINDINGS:We examined birthweight and hypoglycaemia in 108 patients from families with diabetes due to HNF4A mutations, and 134 patients from families with HNF1A mutations. Birthweight was increased by a median of 790 g in HNF4A-mutation carriers compared to non-mutation family members (p < 0.001); 56% (30/54) of HNF4A-mutation carriers were macrosomic compared with 13% (7/54) of non-mutation family members (p < 0.001). Transient hypoglycaemia was reported in 8/54 infants with heterozygous HNF4A mutations, but was reported in none of 54 non-mutation carriers (p = 0.003). There was documented hyperinsulinaemia in three cases. Birthweight and prevalence of neonatal hypoglycaemia were not increased in HNF1A-mutation carriers. Mice with pancreatic beta-cell deletion of Hnf4a had hyperinsulinaemia in utero and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia at birth. CONCLUSIONS:HNF4A mutations are associated with a considerable increase in birthweight and macrosomia, and are a novel cause of neonatal hypoglycaemia. This study establishes a key role for HNF4A in determining foetal birthweight, and uncovers an unanticipated feature of the natural history of HNF4A-deficient diabetes, with hyperinsulinaemia at birth evolving to decreased insulin secretion and diabetes later in life.",

Both ICA and IAA identified 95% [95% confidence interval (CI), 77.2-99.9%] of those who tested persistently positive for multiple (> or = 2) antibodies at the age of 2 yr, GADA identified 86% (CI, 65.1-97.1%), and IA-2A identified 55% (CI, 32.2-75.6%). Close to half of the antibody-positive children (29 of 63) reverted back to antibody negativity. Autoantibodies disappeared more often among those who tested positive for IAA than among those who tested positive for other autoantibodies (P < or = 0.021). Among the 15 children who developed type 1 diabetes, the disease sensitivity of ICA was 80% (CI, 51.9-95.7%), that of IAA was 93% (CI, 68.0-99.8%), that of GADA was 60% (CI, 32.3-83.7%), and that of IA-2A was 40% (CI, 16.3-67.7%). These results suggest that IAA are characterized by high sensitivity, early appearance, and high frequency of transient antibody positivity, whereas ICA detected with a thoroughly standardized assay appear to be more specific for the screening of beta-cell autoimmunity in young children with increased genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in the Finnish population, which has the highest incidence of type 1 diabetes in the world.",

OBJECTIVE:This analysis sought to evaluate disease onset, progression, and long-term outcome of the 2 main treatments in long-term IPEX survivors. METHODS:Clinical histories of 96 patients with a genetically proven IPEX syndrome were collected from 38 institutions worldwide and retrospectively analyzed. To investigate possible factors suitable to predict the outcome, an organ involvement (OI) scoring system was developed. RESULTS:We confirm neonatal onset with enteropathy, type 1 diabetes, and eczema. In addition, we found less common manifestations in delayed onset patients or during disease evolution. There is no correlation between the site of mutation and the disease course or outcome, and the same genotype can present with variable phenotypes. HSCT patients (n = 58) had a median follow-up of 2.7 years (range, 1 week-15 years). Patients receiving chronic IS (n = 34) had a median follow-up of 4 years (range, 2 months-25 years).

The early descriptions of the Chiari malformations by Hans Chiari in 1891 opened the door for future classification and research on this topic. However, even over a long timeframe, our understanding of the pathophysiology and, more importantly, treatment, remained in its infancy. As recently as the 1970s, CIM was not discussed in popular neurology textbooks. Syringomyelia is listed as a degenerative disorder with no satisfactory treatment. Radiation therapy was considered an option in treatment, and surgery was thought to play no role. During the last 40 years, equivalent to the duration of a neurosurgical career, our understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CIM, coupled with modern MRI, has improved the treatment paradigm for this patient population. More importantly, it has given us evidence confirming that CIM is a disorder responsive to surgical intervention, giving patients once thought to be destined for lifelong disability a comparatively normal life after treatment. The purpose of this article is to offer a review of CIM and its important associated entities. The authors will discuss the evolution in understanding of the Chiari malformation and, importantly, distinguish between symptomatic CIM and asymptomatic tonsillar ectopia, based on imaging and presenting symptomatology. They will discuss techniques for surgical intervention, expected outcomes, and complications after surgery. Proper patient selection for surgery based on appropriate symptomatology is tantamount to achieving good surgical outcomes in this population, separating those who can be helped by surgery from those who are unlikely to improve. While our knowledge of the Chiari malformations continues to improve through the efforts of clinical and basic science researchers, surgeons, and patients, our current understanding of these entities represents a monumental improvement in patient care over a relatively short time period.",

However, sudden neurological deterioration is a rare and severe event. Herein, we report rare occurrences of sudden clinical deterioration in two previously asymptomatic children harbouring intradural LLs without dermal sinus tracts or signs of occult dysraphism. A review of the pertinent literature is also included. CASE PRESENTATION:One child exhibited acute deterioration because of an epidural abscess associated with a filar lipoma without a sinus tract (probably caused by haematogenous spreading from a respiratory tract multiple infection), and the other child exhibited acute deterioration because of a very large, holocord syringomyelia-like cyst associated with a small conus lipoma. Both patients were 4 years old. In case #2, a previously undetected, severe tethered cord (conus at the S3-S4 level) was also present. A complete recovery was attained after an urgent surgical operation in both cases (in addition to targeted antibiotic therapy in case #1). All cases of deterioration in the literature were caused by abscess formation in dermal sinus tracts. CONCLUSIONS:Prophylactic surgery may be indicated even in asymptomatic children that have tethered cord and surgically favourable LLs (small dorsal and filar LLs), especially if the conditions are associated with progressive syringomyelia. Similarly, intradural dermal sinus tracts should be regarded as surgery-indicated, even if the conus is in its normal position and the patient is asymptomatic because there is a consistent risk of severe, infection-related complications. Finally, asymptomatic patients with filar LLs and a normally located conus can be candidates for surgery or an accurate clinical and radiological follow-up.",

Only a few cases of adults with spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia associated with Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) have been reported. The timing of surgical intervention for syringomyelia remains controversial. The present report has documented a case with the longest medical history of syringomyelia reported, the associated imaging findings over 16 years, the mild symptom progression after the spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia, and a review of the relevant reported data. The natural history of our patient provides a unique view regarding the factors that might lead to the development and spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia. CASE DESCRIPTION:We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who had been monitored for 16 years for mild symptomatic CM-I and syringomyelia. After regular follow-up examinations for the initial 10 years, magnetic resonance imaging revealed partial spontaneous resolution of the syringomyelia and unchanged symptoms. However, after 6 additional years of follow-up examinations, her symptoms had mildly progressed, and the size of the syringomyelia had obviously decreased. CONCLUSIONS:The findings from our patient suggest that the natural course of mild symptomatic CM-I in adult patients will be benign and nonprogressive. Patients will commonly present with very few or mild symptoms, despite the presence of a large syrinx. It would be reasonable to observe patients with similar mild symptoms and syringomyelia. Surgery will be indicated by the type, severity, and duration of symptoms at the first clinical visit. Periodic follow-up examinations are also essential after spontaneous resolution because the pathophysiology of syringomyelia is incompletely understood and recurrence possible.",

SUMMARY ANSWER:Maternal periconceptional no folic acid supplementation can increase the risk of NTDs associated with previous spontaneous abortion or first-trimester fever, independent of known confounding factors. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY:Maternal periconceptional folic acid deficiency can increase the risk of NTDs. However, whether an interaction between periconceptional no folic acid supplementation and history of spontaneous abortion or first-trimester fever may have an increased risk of NTDs remains unknown. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION:A population-based case-control study was performed including 104 nuclear families with offspring with NTDs and 100 control families with normal offspring between 1993 and 2002. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS:We investigated the potential interaction between periconceptional no folic acid use and a maternal history of spontaneous abortion or first-trimester fever in the risk for NTDs. Information on exposure factors was obtained at the onset of pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes were collected during the first week after delivery or at the time of termination of the pregnancy. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE:The interaction between periconceptional no folic acid use and a maternal history of spontaneous abortion markedly increased the risk of NTDs (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 18.68, 95% CI, 4.43-78.76) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The interaction coefficient was found to be 2.08, higher than 1, indicating that there is a significant interaction between two factors. Mothers who did not take periconceptional folic acid and had first-trimester fever had an increased risk of NTDs (aOR 21.81, 95% CI, 8.81-80.73). However, the interaction coefficient was found to be 0.62, less than 1, indicating that there is no significant interaction between two factors. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION:A potential limitation was that the interval between the previous spontaneous abortion and the beginning of the subsequent pregnancy could not be estimated accurately, but was at least 1 year or more. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS:We emphasize that a previous spontaneous abortion may represent a first occurrence of NTDs rather than be the cause of NTDs. Our findings indicate that mothers with a history of spontaneous abortion are ideal candidates for periconceptional folic acid supplementation.

Animal studies and early human studies investigating in utero MMC closure were promising, leading to Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS trial). This prospective randomized multicenter trial comparing in utero fetal MMC (fMMC) closure to routine postnatal closure demonstrated a decreased need for shunting, reversal of hindbrain herniation, and improved neurologic function in the prenatal repair group, although maternal complications and prematurity were more frequently encountered.

We estimated age-specific life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, and costs due to pertussis in Ontario, Canada, using a model-based approach. METHODS:We developed a microsimulation model to simulate pertussis natural history. Daily probabilities of pertussis complications, hospitalizations, and disease sequelae as well as utilities and costs for health states were literature-derived. A healthcare payer perspective was used with a lifetime time horizon. Model outcomes were compared to those from a model with no pertussis health states. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to generate distributions for estimates. Economic burden was estimated by multiplying case cost estimates by annual age-specific incidence. RESULTS:Overall, LYs lost per pertussis case was low, with negligible LYs lost in those aged >4 years. Infants (<6 months) had the greatest mean QALY loss per case (0.58), while adults lost only 0.05 QALYs per case. Infants experienced the greatest mean cost per case of $22,768 (95% CI: 21,144-23,406). Case costs generally declined with age, but increased in seniors (aged 65+) with mean cost of $1920 (95% CI: 1800-2033). Based on historic age-specific incidence, pertussis costs the Ontario healthcare system approximately $7.6-$21.5 M annually. In total economic cost estimates with QALYs valued at 1xGDP (3xGDP) per capita, the net impact of pertussis in Ontario was estimated at $21.7-$66.5 M annually ($50.0-$156.3 M).

The highest average annual disease burden was estimated for invasive pneumococcal disease (9444 DALYs/year; 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 8911-9961) and influenza (8670 DALYs/year; 95% UI: 8468-8874), which represents 16% and 15% of the total burden of all 32 diseases, respectively. The remaining 30 diseases ranked by number of DALYs/year from high to low were: HIV infection, legionellosis, toxoplasmosis, chlamydia, campylobacteriosis, pertussis, tuberculosis, hepatitis C infection, Q fever, norovirus infection, salmonellosis, gonorrhoea, invasive meningococcal disease, hepatitis B infection, invasive Haemophilus influenzae infection, shigellosis, listeriosis, giardiasis, hepatitis A infection, infection with STEC O157, measles, cryptosporidiosis, syphilis, rabies, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tetanus, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis. The very low burden for the latter five diseases can be attributed to the National Immunisation Programme. The average disease burden per individual varied from 0.2 (95% UI: 0.1-0.4) DALYs per 100 infections for giardiasis, to 5081 and 3581 (95% UI: 3540-3611) DALYs per 100 infections for rabies and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:For guiding and supporting public health policy decisions regarding the prioritisation of interventions and preventive measures, estimates of disease burden and the comparison of burden between diseases can be informative. Although the collection of disease-specific parameters and estimation of incidence is a process subject to continuous improvement, the current study established a baseline for assessing the impact of future public health initiatives.",
1045,GARD:0001876,Diprosopia,15703883,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",[Diprosopus triophthalmus. From ancient terracotta sculptures to spiral computer tomographic reconstruction].,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15703883,"A still-born male fetus from the 19th century, fixed in formalin and presenting as diprosopia triophthalmica, was analysed by helical computer tomography and virtually reconstructed without damage. This rare, incomplete, symmetrical duplication of the face on a single head with three eyes, two noses and two mouths develops in the first 3 weeks of gestation and is a subset of the category of conjoined twins with unknown underlying etiology. Spiral computer tomography of fixed tissue demonstrated in the more than 100 year old specimen that virtual reconstruction can be performed in nearly the same way as in patients (contrast medium application not possible). The radiological reconstruction of the Munich fetus, here confined to head and neck data, is the basis for comparison with a number of imaging procedures of the last 3000 years. Starting with some Neolithic Mesoamerican ceramics, the ""Pretty Ladies of Tlatilco"", diprosopia triophthalmica was also depicted on engravings of the 16th and 17th century A.D. by artists as well as by the anatomist Soemmering and his engraver Berndt in the 18th century. Our modern spiral computer tomography confirms the ability of our ancestors to depict diprosopia triophthalmica in paintings and sculptures with a high level of natural precision.",
